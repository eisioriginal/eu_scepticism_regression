Mr President, Commissioner, without ignoring the fact that data protection is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the current Directive was born of the desire to harmonise national provisions on data retention, in order to ensure the availability of those data for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, such as terrorism or organised crime.  This harmonisation is necessary because the inefficiency arising from the fragmentation created by national provisions has been demonstrated in studies and through practical experience. We therefore need to ensure the continued retention, at European level, of data that are generated or processed.  A recent example of how these data can be used in a judicial context as a tool to fight crime is the arrest in Spain on 4 October 2012 of a young man planning to imitate the Columbine massacre by planting bombs at universities in the Balearic Islands. Following a police investigation using data obtained from electronic communications, it was ascertained that the young man had bought various explosive substances and items of equipment needed to make homemade bombs. As a result, it was possible to prevent a real tragedy.  Nevertheless, I call on the Commission to present an urgent proposal for the revision of the legal framework for data retention, because the importance and sensitivity of this matter means that we cannot continue with a Directive that has technical shortcomings and intrudes, sometimes disproportionately, on the right to privacy.

 Maintaining international peace and security is one of the EU’s primary objectives. Currently, in our struggle to achieve democratic stability, we should not forget Latin America, which is facing important challenges, as already mentioned: democratic consolidation, regional integration, economic and social stability, poverty and, of course, security in the region. On the other hand, our Latin American neighbours share our values and principles, and they have a number of emerging countries such as Brazil and Mexico, which are key members of international forums such as the G20; finally, the region has great economic potential, with 10% growth forecast for the coming decade. In view of this, I believe that next autumn, the European External Action Service should focus strongly on the multi-party trade agreement between Peru, Colombia and the EU, the association agreement with Central America, and the negotiation of the development cooperation instrument. This is a key region for the EU, and we cannot gradually withdraw right when it is expanding the most. In conclusion, the EU is, and should become, even more aware and involved in conflict prevention and the struggle to maintain security. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the report we are debating today is a big step forward for all victims of crime and barbarity. Its progress lies in its due recognition of victims, and it gives more guarantees to the criminal procedure. Quite simply, victims will now have more legal certainty and society will be more sensitive to their suffering and pain. May I congratulate the two rapporteurs for their excellent work and tenacity, and I would particularly like to mention Ms Jiménez-Becerril, twice a victim of terrorism; through her committed campaigning and the complicity I so admire in Commissioner Reding, they have opened a door through which others will follow, so that judges, leaders and civil society can properly recognise the value, example and trauma of so many victims, providing them with guarantees, justice and respect. Today, Mr President, I would also like to send a message of solidarity to the people of the United States for the terrible tragedy that took place on that 11 September. I send them a testimony of my solidarity in a heartfelt prayer. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 I understand that many issues must be taken into account in the debate on the future of the common agricultural policy (CAP), in the context of the debate on the multiannual financial framework and on the transitory period for 2013, but they should not cause us to forget the urgent need to secure our farmers’ present and future. The economic crisis threatens the sector’s survival, so we need to guarantee the level of aid granted to farms, especially in the countries where we are suffering most from the crisis, such as Spain. The necessary financial discipline should not lead to a drastic adjustment of the CAP or a radical reduction in existing funds. I want to express my doubts regarding a possible single rate, even if it is greater than 50%, as it would mean the most vulnerable regions paying more, while ‘budgetary restrictions’ are being required of the country. This is a complicated debate but, now more than ever, we must increase our efforts to strengthen the CAP as part of the backbone of the EU, not forgetting decisive support for those regions and countries being hit particularly hard by the economic crisis. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, this afternoon’s debate is neither new, nor is the issue limited to Romania, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria; it affects all Member States. These are the three affected countries today, but this could happen to any other on other occasions. This House, in fact, in its Declaration of 8 March 2011, has already asked the Commission to establish a new mechanism that will guarantee complete reciprocity for all Member States, ensuring that if a third country fails to reciprocate the visa regime, all Member States would enforce obligatory visa requirements for the citizens of that country. The principles of reciprocity and solidarity should guide the Union’s policy on visas, whilst also respecting, as is the case here, other debates on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the European Union and Canada. Only this way will we achieve a visa policy that is robust, rigorous, credible, supportive and unified. In the same manner, I am also aware of the importance of the Union’s foreign relationships, as well as those of the individual Member States; and for that reason, there is a need to find the balance between respect for the principles of reciprocity and solidarity and European trade relationships. This issue, as you are aware, has been debated for almost a year within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, via a proposal for the modification of Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. This would lead to the establishment of a list of the third countries whose citizens require visas to cross borders and a list of third countries whose citizens are exempt from this requirement. I am the rapporteur for this legislative initiative. The exact objective of this proposal is to provide the Union with an effective and realistic mechanism to resolve conflicts such as those currently being experienced by Romanian, Czech and Bulgarian citizens with Canada. We began the trialogue negotiation stage with the Council a week ago, but I have a strong mandate when it comes to reciprocity. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) is committed and calls for reciprocity. The stances of the three institutions and the Parliament are currently being aligned, but we are all aware of the urgency and the need to reach an agreement that satisfies the interests of all those concerned. Commissioner, I do not believe we can reach this agreement under the Danish Presidency. You are already aware that Parliament only says ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to an international agreement. I will say ‘no’ and will recommend that my political group says ‘no’ if Canada does not absolve the Czechs, Bulgarians and Romanians from the obligation, prior to the vote. Mr President, Mr Enciu makes a very solid and impeccable argument. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the European economic crisis is not strong enough to dissuade illegal immigrants who risk their lives at sea. Why is this? It is because the difficult situation that they find themselves in here does not compare to the conditions there. Besides that, there is the question of asylum, which transcends and has nothing to do with purely economic situations or situations of another nature. Asylum must always be equal to protection. I welcome Mr Iacolino’s initiative as it is very appropriate and I agree that it should be extended and reproduced every year, but in December. The phenomenon of heading out to sea in spring is not a new one – it is predictable – and, although it cannot be avoided, it can be alleviated. The Member States can control neither the Mediterranean nor the Atlantic front on their own. We need a timetable of solidarity, intelligence and diplomacy to do just three things: firstly, to try to stop them leaving at source; secondly, to patrol, save and help those who have managed to get out; and thirdly, to welcome those who have managed to arrive in decent and humanitarian conditions. There needs to be coordinated action between the Commission, the Member States, Frontex and third countries. These are not easy tasks – I am well aware of that – but we must not hold an untimely debate each year that has limited effectiveness. May I remind you that this discussion began in the parliamentary delegation sent to Sicily and Lampedusa almost six months ago. Then there is the question of the immigrant internment centres and the administrative detention centres, which must, without a shadow of a doubt, improve their reception and residence conditions, and the question of a legal, safe return and resettlement subject to scrupulous respect for human rights. As you can see, what I am telling you is not an issue that affects a particular country: it affects the whole of the EU and we must all make a commitment to providing an adequate response to this humanitarian challenge. We are late in saying this, but it is better to say it than not, and it is appropriate to do so on 9 May. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the interinstitutional balance is a reference that is bound by the Treaties and declared a fundamental political issue, both by Parliament and by the Commission and the Council. Mr President, I would like to denounce, as a repeated attitude, the lack of sensitivity on the part of any Commissioner of the European Commission who does not have availability in their schedule to respond to requests for interviews or meetings with MEPs. I will not mention names or specific cases today, but I think that Mr Barroso – who has always set an example of cooperation with Parliament and its MEPs – should send out an unequivocal signal to the College of Commissioners that meetings at the request of MEPs should be a priority and take place frequently. The reasons to protect cooperation and the much talked-about interinstitutional balance are unquestionable, not to mention the due respect that this House deserves. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Madam President, here is my opinion on the matter. As a response to the threats that the EU and the US must face, the Passenger Name Records (PNR) Agreement must be interpreted within the framework of the fight against transnational crime in all its dimensions. The strategy on the external dimension of Justice and Home Affairs, the EU strategy against terrorism and the Stockholm Programme all refer to the need to establish close cooperation with third countries through exchange of information. The data that are gathered under the PNR Agreement are used for purposes of preventing, detecting, suppressing and pursuing and for those purposes only. This new agreement provides great improvements by comparison with the 2007 agreement. The PUSH method is recognised as the mode of transfer, there is greater protection for data gathered, the number of supervisory authorities is increased and there are advances in data evaluation, not to mention the right of citizens to request correction or deletion of their PNR data, with the possibility of administrative or judicial redress. Moreover, the agreement respects the right to privacy in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Limitations may only be introduced where they are necessary and where they genuinely meet the general interest objectives recognised by the EU or protect the rights and freedoms of others. In these circumstances, we have two options: vote in favour of the agreement, and benefit from the improvements that have been introduced, or vote against. In the latter case, we would create great legal uncertainty that could lead to the signing of bilateral agreements, and to penalties and obligations being placed on airlines. We must commit and ensure a high level of effective protection of personal data, which means that any transfer of PNR data to the US must be done in a secure manner and in accordance with EU law and that passengers can exercise their rights in relation to the use of their data. In light of this situation then, Madam President, I am in favour of this agreement to combat terrorism and transnational crime.

Madam President, actually, I was referring to EU security strategy and the Stockholm Programme. You must not have been listening properly. The fact is, you use the language of Goethe and I use the language of Cervantes, and we have interpreters but, in spite of this, we cannot communicate with one another. Why? We cannot communicate because you speak of impressions and I speak of experiences. Based on my experiences, therefore, I am firmly in favour of the Passenger Name Records (PNR) in matters of security. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Coelho, thank you. We must highlight the advances represented by the use of biometric passports but we cannot deny the problems that exist in terms of implementation, especially the weaknesses detected in the passport-issuance chain. It would serve no purpose to equip border controls with great technical instruments if the system has a significant weakness in terms of procedures. In this context, if we take it into account, the balance between combating crime in the EU, respecting individual rights and guaranteeing free movement in the Schengen area takes on even greater importance. The forging of documents, organised crime and terrorism constitute direct attacks on our citizens but also on their personal rights and so we must reinforce the whole process of gathering and handling information of a personal nature. We must afford greater security to the travel document, establishing a reliable link between the passport and its holder. Accordingly, repeated fraudulent practice provides ample justification for the evaluation reports. Commissioner Malmström, we await the intermediate report scheduled for June, and the report scheduled for mid-2013, with great interest. We continue to back training for those responsible for managing the system, along with improvements to and interoperability of equipment and documents issued at each of the stages, without compromising, of course, either the information or the rights of the holder of the passport. Commissioner, being in a position to determine the scope of the issue of fingerprinting children, which, as has already been stated, is currently under study, is very important. Therefore, I place great value on the Portuguese Government’s decision to give reliability to the procedure. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, I echo the need to reach an overall agreement for the future that ensures the survival of the most deprived persons in the Union. We are talking about vulnerable, excluded, and poor people. The figures state that 13 million people in 19 Member States are experiencing poverty, 30 million people are undernourished, and 43 million people are at risk of experiencing food poverty, which shows the need to work together in order to ensure the programme continues after 2013. We must make use of the debate on the multiannual financial framework, as well as the debate on CAP reform, in order to ensure food aid and to overcome the legal obstacles. The Member States are going through a difficult period, but that is exactly why we now have to make greater efforts to protect those who are suffering the most due to the crisis: children, the sick, the unemployed, the elderly, and those 80 million people who are currently living below the poverty line in general. The Commission’s right to initiative is vital and essential. There are no disagreements in that respect in this Parliament, Mr President. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, I was and I am a supporter of Kosovo. During the Milosevic era I was in the refugee camps in Kukes, Elbasan, Stankovic, and so on. I welcomed many members of the Kosovo Liberation Army to my own city and offered them my solidarity. However, Mr President, Kosovo today has problems of corruption, control of the media, organised crime, and of government with room for improvement. In my opinion, Mr President, Kosovo does not today meet any of the necessary conditions either for being in the European Union or for being an independent country.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to heartily congratulate Mr Rui Tavares. This debate is a step towards the Union undertaking more humanitarian work, and providing greater international protection for refugees. We commend the improvement in reception conditions, the use of asylum procedures and the promotion of good and effective practices to ensure that people’s rights are protected in the international domain. Taking into account the fact that there were 301 000 asylum applications last year, of which 59 465 were accepted, we must streamline resettlement measures in the interest of maximising the efficiency of the services supplied. Five thousand resettlements in Europe is still very small in solidarity terms. I also went to Shusha. Far more Member States are going to have to involve themselves in resettlement, and therefore, we support the provision of additional financial support for those making the effort for the first time. There is also the need to provide additional financial support for the resettlement of people from specific geographical regions and nationalities once this has been decided as the most appropriate way of responding to their specific needs. The urgency and priority of Member State support should not be forgotten when it comes to children and women from specific risk groups, the victims of psychological, physical and sexual violence, as well as the victims of exploitation. One in every five asylum seekers is under the age of thirteen. Congratulations, Mr President, for this interinstitutional agreement. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Mr President, I understand that regulation when it comes to data protection can be based on internal security strategies. We cannot forget, however, that its extra-territorial impact could infringe on the rights of European citizens. What has arisen in connection with the Medicare Act, FISA, the Patriot Act and FATCA cases is more than mere concern. It appears that many of these measures stipulate that European financial entities, in the widest sense of the term, are obliged to provide all types of information, whether it concerns the title holder, their account types or the withholding of payments, among others. There is no prior agreement to justify obtaining this data, nor do the users know what the data will be used for or the amount of time for which it will be stored. It is therefore necessary to adopt measures and design a body of regulations and legislation to avoid infringement of the principle of territoriality. We should be able to maintain our relationships outside the Union, as well as our territory’s security, whilst totally respecting the rights of European citizens. The European Commission should show much more commitment and interest in this task. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I reiterate: the food programme must be extended indefinitely. Our credibility is linked to the solidarity we show, and more so in a crisis period. Nobody can reasonably deny this, nor will they be able to. We know the disappointing and bitter figures. What poor person cares about the legal basis, or the ruling, or the common agricultural policy or the social dimension? Are we going to explain it to them? I do not want to and I cannot. We do not provide any justification for not giving, ladies and gentlemen, but we want to justify the fact that now we are taking away what we once gave them, and this is truly inexplicable. I ask for justice and I ask for compassion. We cannot reduce the EUR 500 million, because it is needed. For poor people, the situation is not a crisis. It is critical, and it affects the most vulnerable of them: old people, children, the sick, the homeless, those without power, without medicines and without food. React, ladies and gentlemen of the Council, react. I do not see any poor person sitting in the Council, Mr President. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, let me say it again: the food programme must be extended until 2020. The programme provides food aid to 13 million poor people in 19 Member States. Thirty million people in the Union suffer from malnutrition, 43 million are at risk of suffering from food poverty and 80 million live below the poverty threshold. What we are asking for – what I am asking for – is not charity. It is compassion and it is justice. We must maintain the level of financing at EUR 500 million. The poor are those who are suffering most from the crisis and much more so in winter: without a roof over their heads, in extreme cold, without power and without food. This affects the most vulnerable: children, old people and the sick. Solidarity within the Union cannot now be a dialectical resource, because that would make it a contemptible resource.

 Mr President, our energy dependence is a well-known fact. We import 60% of our gas and 83% of our oil. As for coal, our dependence amounts to 41%. Coal is the Union’s principal electricity-producing fuel, on a par with nuclear energy and gas. If we limit our mining capacity, we will simply have to import it from countries that do not have our social or environmental standards. In its energy strategy for 2050, the Commission should review the current framework of aid provision to coal mining. There is scope for improvement of the new legislation as regards the time limit for mine closure or the requirement to return the aid received in order to continue in operation. Our energy dependency is one more of our external weaknesses and, in the current crisis, we will pay the price for it sooner rather than later. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
).

 Mr President, it is regrettable that the European Union should abandon thousands of refugees to their fate on account of a mere institutional disagreement, and I am pointing my finger at the Council. The debate on the legislative procedure to choose priority regions has gone to absurd extremes, breaking the principle of solidarity which inspires the Union and the European Refugee Fund. The issue is not whether we should use a procedure based partially on codecision, as proposed by the Council, or the ordinary legislative procedure proposed by this House. The really important matter is to help those who most need it and to ensure the priority regions are chosen promptly so that the ultimate aim of helping persecuted and deprived people can be achieved. If this choice is considered a delegated act, then let us accept the comitology procedure; if not, let us agree once and for all on the mechanism through which the choice is to be made. I have visited many refugee camps, the last one of them in July …  (The President cut off the speaker) Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Madam President, I fully support the proposal for a directive; it is a real breakthrough. Furthermore, Ms Angelilli’s commitment to the cause of child protection is one of the most noble objectives that a parliamentarian can undertake. Children are weak and vulnerable and therefore deserve the highest level of protection. Sexual abuse of children must be prevented with new legislative measures and punished harshly under criminal law. So-called sex tourism and child pornography are forms of exploitation which should be a matter of priority for law enforcement, including international agreements on the matter. In my opinion, all agreements with third countries on free trade and development aid must include a child protection clause. We must also focus our serious concerns on the child indoctrination that occurs in some countries suffering structural poverty, where they hand over many children, the offspring of polygamous unions, to apparently religious schools to avoid lack of food and hunger. Child assassins, child soldiers and child drug runners are among the most heinous forms of exploitation, a widespread phenomenon on two continents which has irreversible social repercussions. Programmes to rescue child victims of forced prostitution must be a political and social priority of the European Union. Line 11600 must have the commitment and unwavering support of all Member States. Madam President, I appreciate and applaud the effort and commitment of the Council, but I particularly applaud the commitment of Ms Malmström and Ms Angelilli.

 Mr President, I congratulate Ms Lambert and the shadow rapporteurs on the impetus given to this report, without which there would have been no agreement with the Council. How to go about deciding who qualifies as a family member was a key factor for my group. This needs to be defined properly to prevent abuse of the Community system for international protection. The distinction between beneficiaries of asylum and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection is essential when agreeing on who has what rights. Subsidiary protection is more limited in time than asylum, the former status providing entitlement to a shorter residence permit (one year) and the latter to a longer residence permit (three years), although both cases can be reviewed if the threat to the beneficiaries remains. The plan to remove the distinction between the two forms of protection was originally rejected by my group and by the Council, which is why we must now congratulate ourselves on the agreement reached with the rapporteur. The need to recognise the rights that legitimately belong to those that are persecuted is consistent with measures to prevent fraudulent use of the European system for international protection. We must also welcome the fact that the report sets out the need for Member States and their authorities to safeguard the best interests of minors and to extend protection to unaccompanied minors, paying particular attention to their safety, well-being and development, as well as the principle of family unity. Lastly, Mr President, the inclusion of references to persecution by customs or traditions, resulting in genital mutilation, forced abortion or forced sterilisation is a remarkable and outstanding achievement.

Mr President, this is a debate that has already taken place, but I shall make some comments with reference to new scenarios. Following the failed attack on a plane on 25 December 2009, more effective protection and detection technology had to be sought. Scanners at airports increase levels of security but they present problems, especially in relation to the protection of human rights. The Council and the Commission accepted Mr de Grandes Pascual’s proposal that security scanners should not use technology based on ionising radiation. Now it must be decided whether the exploration mechanism will use real passenger images or stick images, which are the most appropriate option in order to protect the intimacy, privacy, health and dignity of passengers. However, stick figures present a problem in terms of free competition since today, only one company has that technology. Although other companies in the sector have announced that they can introduce the algorithms needed in order to adapt the scanners, the machine configuration time could work against them. Therefore, the Commission should examine the timeframe for implementing the rules relating to body scanners, avoiding a possible monopoly situation and supporting decisively Parliament’s report and the report of Mr de Grandes Pascual, which are one and the same thing. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, Ms Meissner, thank you very much for your interesting question. Strictly speaking, in order to avoid what you are unhappy about and what I, too, am unhappy about, I would say and repeat that what the Commission should do is examine the timeframe for the implementation of rules relating to body scanners very carefully. That way, everyone will be able to compete on equal terms but in line with what has been said by Parliament and in Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, let us indeed talk about solidarity and the poor. In the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting, a blocking minority opposed the amendment to the regulation governing food aid to the most disadvantaged. Mr Sawicki has already explained their reasons. However, the Council should be reminded that 60% of the funds is needed to feed the 79 million people in Europe who live below the poverty line. Those funds are provided by national, regional and local governments, and by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Up until last April, the European Union contributed 40%. The position taken by the blocking minority would lead to a drastic reduction in aid for next year, and a complete abolition by 2013. We condemn this. I would like to thank the Polish Presidency and the Commission for their determination to continue the programme, and I emphatically condemn the position of those Member States that formed a blocking minority. I ask those Member States: where is your compassion? Have you even heard of compassion? I urge Mr Cioloş and Mr Sawicki not to give up, because no court can go against the law of God, or against compassion. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Madam President, Commissioner, on my initiative, between 13 July 2011 and 16 July 2011 a delegation from the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs went to Tunisia, specifically to the refugee camps on its border with Libya and the camp at Sousse. There are 4 500 people from Darfur, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire, Palestine and Iraq living in inhumane conditions and suffering an extreme temperature of 50 degrees centigrade. There is sickness and violence; the camp has burned down three times; and there is a lack of hygiene and drinking water. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Médecins Sans Frontières
 and other organisations are doing a tremendous job. Tunisia has shown solidarity with displaced persons and refugees from Libya. Tunisians have welcomed 90 000 Libyans into their own homes. However, beyond this emergency nobody is taking care of those in Sousse. There is a major difference between the Europe that donates and the Europe that does not receive. Our solidarity extends to other countries, but we do not show solidarity within our borders. We now need to make an impassioned plea for resettlement, so that the 4 000 refugees can be received on European soil. This is neither complicated nor expensive. There has been a show of commitment, as the Commissioner said, but there needs to be something more than good will and statements of intent. We urgently need to resettle those groups who are suffering so much hardship in Sousse and who, in Europe, could find hope for their shattered lives. Many times and in desperate voices they asked Europe not to abandon them. Others told us their child had lost 10 kilos and was malnourished and in need of medical attention, but they had nowhere to go. Resettlement offers have so far totalled – or would total, if they were carried out – 718, but that still leaves 3 707 people. Madam President, I strongly call on the Council and the Commission to show commitment in order to end this serious humanitarian crisis as soon as possible. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the European Union is Taiwan’s fifth largest trading partner, whereas for the Union, this Asian island ranks fourteenth among its trading partners. Trade between the two parties has increased by 800% in the last decades, with the annual trade volume currently standing at EUR 27.5 billion. Last year alone, trade between the Union and Taiwan grew by 39%. This growth has been boosted by measures such as visa exemption, introduced via the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. In spite of this and the fact that the Europe 2020 strategy stresses that the Union needs to step up its trade links with growing and emerging markets, our relations with Taiwan have not reached their full development as far as trade is concerned. It is therefore necessary to bring in new measures to remove the obstacles – including tariffs, trade prohibitions, taxes and duties on luxury products – which currently prevent us from unlocking the full potential of trade with Taiwan. This would be a decisive step towards a dynamic, ambitious free trade agreement, which I support. A free trade agreement is necessary and it will benefit the parties involved. Good trade dialogue is not enough, Commissioner. We need to go much further. Furthermore, no one has the right to veto our relations. The ties between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China are getting stronger every day, and we, the European Union, have sovereignty to decide, without anyone’s interference, who we negotiate our free trade agreements with.

 Madam President, on 29 June 2011 a group of Taliban terrorists murdered Antonio Planas in Kabul, a Spanish national like myself, aged 49, married and the father of a young girl. Until a few days ago, certain Spanish nationals who were victims of terrorist attacks outside of the European Union territory could not have access to protection and compensation mechanisms. On 23 June 2011, however, the legislation was amended to benefit terrorist victims and their relatives, irrespective of the country where the attack took place. The threat is not limited to a given territory and it must be prevented at national, EU and international level, strengthening cooperation with third countries. The defence of terrorist victims and their rights should be a priority policy in the Union, and the institutions should encourage their public recognition. Thus, we welcome the actions proposed by the Commission, although more concrete instruments to help the victims of terror are still needed. The family of Antonio Planas needs our help, and we urge the institutions concerned to provide it. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, corruption costs the European Union the same amount as its annual budget. Four out of every five citizens consider corruption to be one of the biggest problems for Member States. On 6 June 2011, the Commission published the package of measures aimed at fighting corruption. That is commendable. These measures include the introduction of updated EU rules on public procurement, rules on auditing and regulatory monitoring of EU companies, development of a biannual report that identifies corruption trends, measures relating to the confiscation of criminal assets, a strategy to improve research on financial crime, and the action plan for improving statistics on corruption offences. These proposals are warmly welcomed. Nevertheless, we need to show caution with regard to Member States’ individual compliance with implementation, especially when we consider the data provided by the report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to which 12 out of the 27 EU Member States have no anti-corruption rules or have minimal, insufficient standards. That is why we have doubts about the Commission’s real capacity – despite its best intentions – to implement the measures it has proposed; it therefore needs to go further, guaranteeing that all the Member States make a real commitment to combating corruption, for this is of great necessity, above and beyond expert groups, political will or generalities. We call for specific, legally-binding actions. That is what we are asking for. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Madam President, I offer my sincere congratulations to Mr Busuttil, to the Commission and to the Council. The creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is one of the Union’s greatest achievements, enabling almost 500 million people to move freely within its territory. The removal of internal borders meant that the peripheral countries were obliged to strengthen their border controls, a function which, as you will recall, falls within the exclusive competence of the countries concerned. The land-locked countries benefit from the free area, but occasionally they forget that this situation is largely due to the effort made by Member States with external boundaries, an effort which is bound to increase in situations where there is a migration crisis. To an ever-increasing extent, these situations require the intervention of Frontex. However, the agency’s ability to react is limited as it lacks the necessary resources. This lack of resources is due in large part to the lack of real commitment on the part of certain Member States. Thus, it was necessary and appropriate to strengthen the Frontex Regulation, clearly defining the agency’s role and providing the legal instruments enabling it to be equipped with the necessary means and resources needed to carry out its goals in full accordance with fundamental rights. The provision of economic, material and human resources cannot depend on the good will of only some Member States, since solidarity should be binding and general. Frontex should also coordinate its activities with Europol and Eurojust to fight organised crime. Cooperation with the European Asylum Support Office is an essential element in ensuring access to international protection. The creation of a system of border guards is an interesting proposal which may be brought about if it is implemented through the compulsory solidarity clause. In short, approval of the proposed regulation will make it possible to manage migratory flows better, fight the mafias more effectively and improve the common asylum system.

 Mr President, I reject this report as inappropriate, mistaken, misinformed, untimely and subjective. The fight against terrorism is very necessary and it must be efficient, act as a deterrent and have a preventative effect too. Although it must be valued, its costs should never be evaluated in economic terms. How many euros does a life cost? How many euros do three thousand lives cost? I support democratic judges and police officers and I trust in them and I believe in our democratic vitality to correct the abuses of power that could occur. I would also cite psalm 46 in solidarity: ‘Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea’. I share the reflected absence too; it is present in my heart and in my speeches as are all the victims: those of Madrid, London, Marrakech, Casablanca and Bali, all of them. No, Mr President, this own-initiative report is a bad initiative. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Madam President, the reality: 30 million people are malnourished and 79 million people live in poverty; the tragedy: a court decision; the shame: that we allow this. The European Parliament must make its unanimous and powerful voice heard. This is an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to the weakest people. We must make a distinction between selfish rhetoric and real solidarity. We, Madam President, must create the momentum so that the Council allows us to do away with the blocking minority. We are wholeheartedly calling for the solidarity – agreed to yesterday in this House – of the President-in-Office of the Council, of the Polish Presidency. Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament cannot forsake millions of people, the poorest of the poor, who suffer the most acute effects of the crisis. We are talking about a budget going from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million, which is a decrease of 63%. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, within an hour, Parliament must clearly declare that, regardless of the outcome of the court decision, the essence of the EU, which is solidarity, is present here, in this House, the house of the people and of the European peoples. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, Schengen is a milestone in the construction of the area of liberty, security and justice. Freedom of movement is, moreover, a fundamental pillar of the EU, enshrined in Article 45 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights and it must be preserved and protected. We need more Europe, not less Europe. Limiting the Schengen agreement is not the solution. What we must do is overcome, once and for all, the reluctance of some Member States to make advances in the sphere of immigration. The EU has the means to do it but the political will is lacking. We can and must reinforce external border control mechanisms, improve and equip the capabilities and means of Frontex, promote the creation and implementation of Eurosur, drive the implementation of the second generation Schengen Information System and the Visa Information System, foster cooperation and the exchange of information between border, police, judicial and customs services, and advance determinedly towards the construction of a common policy on matters of immigration, asylum and visas that gives special consideration to cooperation agreements with third countries. The performance of the Member States in the sphere of immigration should be inspired by Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, helping in solidarity those who, by virtue of their geographic position, are obliged to deal with extraordinary flows of irregular immigrants or those seeking international protection. The responsibility must be shared in this regard, Mr President. I am bound to note that the reintroduction of border controls and internal controls for circumstances not provided for in Articles 23, 24 and 25 of the Schengen Borders Code is illegal and seriously violates the provisions of Article 77 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The mechanism for evaluation by a Community court, proposed by the Commission, should be the only instrument and should be extraordinary and temporary. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
).

Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very rigorous work. The objective of this report is to maintain a high level of security in airports while safeguarding citizens’ fundamental rights. Air transport is a target for terrorist attacks, and it is therefore necessary to strengthen security in order to protect people, infrastructure, cargo and mail. In that respect, security scanners in airports are a useful tool. Their inclusion among screening methods used to detect banned or dangerous items is therefore necessary. However, it is vital for a thorough evaluation to be carried out in advance, in order to determine the least harmful technology and the level of non-cumulative emissions that is acceptable for public health. It is also important that, with this technology, the protection of personal data is guaranteed and the dignity of the individual being screened is preserved. I would like to point out that Member States can implement stricter security measures than those required by European legislation, thus having the capacity to introduce scanners in airports under their jurisdiction. The EU institutions therefore need to lay down common rules of procedure with regard to detection performance criteria and tools. Information relating to the screening procedure is a vital element of this tool. Airport personnel must receive proper training in order to provide passengers with adequate information on screening safety, voluntary participation, alternatives and the deletion of images. To conclude, I would like to emphasise that any passenger’s decision to refuse screening does not make them a suspect, and that the selection criteria for being scanned will be based exclusively on security reasons and not on any other grounds, such as race or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religion, and so on. Having nothing further to add, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Madam President, I support Mr Coelho’s thorough work and I congratulate him on his negotiating capacity, in Parliament and at first reading. In terms of the need to create a new agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems, we should remember that the Commission itself has declared that it cannot assume the responsibility for managing large databases, and that creating a merely executive agency would not in any case give Parliament control, because it would still be embedded in the structure of the European Commission. Considering the important work being entrusted to the new agency and the need for this work to be scrutinised by Parliament, however, the new body should take the form of a European agency with its own legal status. Its objectives should be clearly defined, these being operational management of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS) and Eurodac. It could also take responsibility for the preparation, development and operational management of other large-scale information systems. However, it should be noted that this must in all cases be done with the right legal instruments. The agency will not under any circumstances be able to take political decisions, such as creating new information systems or decisions on interoperability with different systems. The important role that the agency is to play means it must have a reinforced administrative structure that will ensure data integrity and protection, and for this reason it is essential that it incorporate a post of data security manager and an independent data protection body, thereby complying with the legal provisions contained in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In conclusion, Mr Coelho, I am very much in agreement with your three initial points, and with the seven points made by Parliament on making a strong commitment to reaching an EU solution and taking a firm stand against any limitation of the Schengen Area.

 Mr President, 30 million people in the European Union suffer from malnutrition and a further 79 million live below the poverty threshold. Most of them depend on food aid provided primarily by food banks. Some 40% of the funds needed to provide this food come from contributions made by the Union, through the European Scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union. This scheme has been implemented to date in accordance with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 983/2008 establishing aid for the purchase of cereals, skimmed milk powder and rice. The Regulation was partially revoked in April by the General Court of the European Union, with the budget for food aid being reduced from EUR 500 million to EUR 133 million. The integration of the European Union has historically been based on the principle of solidarity. This is why, Mr President, we urge the new Polish Presidency and the European Parliament, now more than ever, to show their commitment to helping the most deprived, and to re-establishing the budget appropriation that is currently so limited. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, in my view, the arrest warrant is a fundamental tool in the fight against organised crime, terrorism and other forms of crime. It is a proven tool and, according to the Decision, the cornerstone of cooperation and the first concrete example of the principal of mutual recognition in the sphere of criminal law. Of course it is a very useful tool but we must not fail to mention that it also has weaknesses. The weaknesses are perfectly identified, as Commissioner Reding has also said, not only in the Commission’s report of April 2011, but also in its reports of 2005 and 2006. Those weaknesses, which stem fundamentally from two basic and essential premises, can and, naturally, must be corrected. The arrest warrant has two components: issue and refusal or surrender, as appropriate. The figures show that it is a useful tool, with 54 000 arrest warrants having been issued and 12 000 executed. Turning to the question of what corrections need to be made, what we need are greater and better procedural guarantees around issue, refusal and surrender. The issue of proportionality or the lack thereof in the use of the arrest warrant is critical, a key issue. For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to hear Commissioner Reding say that Member States will be required to exercise a proportionality test and to take care not to issue arrest warrants for minor offences. Incidentally, Mr President, during the course of these questions, one particular item has slipped in, namely, that every arrest warrant costs the Public Treasury EUR 25 000. This is something that was said by an Irish judge. I say to that judge that I do not believe it and that he should demonstrate on what basis such a calculation was made. Consequently, I believe that the arrest warrant should continue in force in revitalised form, with better procedural guarantees. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
No, Mr Dartmouth. I believe that the European Arrest Warrant is a more useful and more versatile tool for combating all the forms of crime to which we have referred. Commissioner Reding has already told you, and I emphasise the fact, that an extradition order can take up to a year whereas a European Arrest Warrant, on the other hand, must be substantiated within 40 days. That is why I believe that the latter is a much more versatile and much more useful procedure for fighting crime, wrongdoing and terrorism. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Coelho, and I do this because his work is consistently rigorous. I now add that we must help Bulgaria and Romania. I trust Bulgaria and Romania. They have worked well and hard and they should receive what is theirs by right – this is no gift. The Presidency-in-office of the Council and the Commissioner, Mrs Malmström, have both stated that these two countries comply with the technical and legal requirements, and I add my voice to theirs. I believe we should not consider any criteria other than the strictly technical and legal. These criteria essentially number five. They comply with the following: they comply with the data protection requirements, they comply with the Schengen Information System (SIS), they comply with police cooperation, they comply with the issue of visas and they comply with the control of external borders by air, sea and land. Strictly speaking, they also comply with the SIS and with the Supplementary Information Request at the National Entry (SIRENE). In view of all this, this House should send an unequivocally strong message to the Council and, notably, to the permanent representations of five countries that I shall refrain from mentioning but which are in the minds of all of us here today. I do believe, ladies and gentlemen, that in including Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area, which comprises more than four hundred million human beings, we are adding, not subtracting; we are building a stronger Europe. Furthermore, we should avoid double standards. Nor should we set conditions for Romania and Bulgaria that we do not ask of the other Member States in order to form part of this area of freedom. Thus, to end my speech, I fervently express my wish for a strong, majority-endorsed message to be sent from this House to the Council. Congratulations once again, Mr Coelho, and congratulations to Romania and Bulgaria. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to speak and to use this debate to talk about a fundamental issue: the emergency. They cannot cope alone. The root of this problem is, as everybody knows, in the unstable situations in Tunisia and Egypt, and the war in Libya. However, there is no limit to how long it will last: unfortunately, it will last a worrying length of time. We therefore need to decide how we can use our common policies to manage the emergency, because they cannot cope alone. In my opinion, Madam President, Commissioner, solidarity with the victims and solidarity with the host states and regions must be our priority. We have instruments that we are not using properly. We have four funds. Mrs Malmström told us clearly and briskly about sums that strike me as ridiculous. She spoke of EUR 30 million, EUR 25 million on request, etc. However, our four funds, the Refugee Fund, the Return Fund, the External Borders Fund and the Integration Fund, total almost EUR 3 billion within the scope of the financial perspectives. Mrs Malmström, it seems to me that these funds should be used for emergency situations, because we need to have the ability to use them and modify them. Our limitations in terms of collaboration and solidarity are symbolised by the fragility that the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union has demonstrated with the Hermes Operation. The arrival of increasing numbers of people fleeing the war and fleeing from desperation highlight how limited this capacity is. They cannot cope alone. Who can cope? The European Union has the necessary solidarity to meet the requirements of this emergency in real time. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I think nobody will be surprised to hear me say again that solidarity with refugees and displaced persons should constitute a fundamental element of EU policy in the areas of asylum and immigration. However, it is not just a question of having solidarity with those coming from weak and disadvantaged societies, but also with the Member States that, because of their geographic location, their culture or their language, suffer greater pressure in this regard. While numbers of applications for protection and of immigrants arriving are low in some countries, there are many other  countries that are unable to tackle on their own the pressure their borders are subjected to on a daily basis. Following Parliament’s adoption of the reports relating to the Commission communication on the Union resettlement programme and the modification of the European Refugee Fund in May 2010, we are still waiting for the Council to complete the codecision procedure. The pilot projects currently being undertaken in 10 Member States are a drop in an ocean, which we still have to cross. The southern Member States are subjected to great pressure, particularly since the popular movements in Egypt and Tunisia, and the war in Libya, began. Lampedusa, with a population of 5 000, has received almost 6 000 immigrants since the conflicts started. The aforementioned pilot projects are completely insufficient and will hardly do anything to relieve the pressure that is already affecting Italy and Malta, but will affect other Mediterranean countries in the near future. The Union as a whole must help these countries. It is imperative that the Council overcome the obstacles currently preventing the full implementation of a European resettlement programme and defeat the minorities blocking it. Massive population displacements and migrations affect the Union as a whole and not just a part of it. I am finishing, Mr President. Last week I called for a European Parliament presence on Libya’s borders and I repeat that call now. It is not enough for 10 fellow Members to have spent last week in Egypt: we must have the capacity to evaluate the humanitarian situation ourselves. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, there are thousands of refugees and thousands of displaced people. The solution to this emergency is evacuation. What is needed is transport. As Mr Guterres said, these people do not want to come to the European Union; they want to go back home. There are 2 million immigrants, 1 million Egyptians and 80 000 Bangladeshis. We must focus on the weakest of the weak: Eritreans, Somalis, the sub-Saharan Africans mistaken for mercenaries and Palestinians. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) says it needs USD 160 million over three months for water, medicines, food and transport. We expect a resounding response from the Union on Friday. Gaddafi cannot escape international criminal justice: mass attacks on his people constitute crimes against humanity. Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is already taking action. Mr President, the European Parliament must be involved. We are also a democratic instrument for applying pressure and informing the free world. We need a mandate from this Chamber for a delegation of Parliament in the UNHCR, Red Cross and Red Crescent refugee camps. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, in 2012, we urgently need a common asylum policy. The report presented by the Commission on 8 September highlights the numerous obstacles that the Member States encounter when seeking to achieve the objectives of Directive 2005/85/EC. Asylum seekers’ right to legal aid applies at different levels. Many Member States invoke the directive in providing legal assistance at the appeal stage, while others grant that right during both the application process and at second instance. Some Member States require proof of merit in order to decide whether or not free legal assistance is granted at the appeal stage. In the majority of cases, there are major differences regarding the deadlines for appealing, while the applicability of the automatic suspension of the effects of refusals also presents difficulties, as it only applies in six Member States. These differences demonstrate that the directive must be reviewed. In reviewing it, the Commission stresses the need to focus efforts on the initial phase of the procedure, in order to be more effective in differentiating which people have a right to protection. According to the Commission, this measure will help to save significant interpreting and legal assistance costs at second instance. However, the proposal is not accompanied by a detailed study of what the interpreting and legal assistance costs would be at first instance, nor of the costs that the Member States actually incur currently when applying the European legislation. For that reason, the Commission needs to provide information as to the actual costs relating to its proposal to focus efforts, and I do not think that the refusal that I have just heard from the Commission is acceptable. I sincerely believe that this is unacceptable and that it needs to be reconsidered or qualified. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, international adoption that is inspired by the principles of prevalence of the interests of the child and respect for his fundamental rights is an appropriate means of finding a family for children for whom a family cannot be found in their country of origin. People trafficking, sexual exploitation and work slavery are a terrible reality affecting hundreds of millions of minors. Let us look at some of the statistics: there are more than 145 million abandoned children in the world; in Russia alone, more than 600 000 live on the streets; since 1980, more than 2 million children have died in armed conflicts; more than 600 million children live in extreme poverty; more than 5 million die every year; more than 130 million children in developed countries grow up without access to a basic education due to their poverty, and 60% of them are girls; 7 million children worldwide are subject to sexual slavery. For all these reasons, we must foster mechanisms to promote an international adoption instrument inspired by protecting children, harmonising the different requirements and procedures laid down in the legislation of the Member States, in particular, applying Article 21 of the European Charter of Children’s Rights and taking into consideration Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Madam President, Commissioner, trafficking in human beings is a harsh reality in the EU. Sexual exploitation is the main objective of the mafias that traffic human beings, followed by forced labour, domestic service, forced marriages, exploitation of children for begging, illegal adoption and the removal of organs, which are other scourges and aspects of the problem. The new powers that Article 63 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives Parliament must be used in order to strengthen EU legislation in this field. This includes, among many other issues, calling for the classification of crimes that are still not covered by some European criminal legislation. We need to strengthen our legislation to protect victims of trafficking from two perspectives: prevention and protection, and integration into society and the labour market. We need to establish specific measures to protect minors; to criminalise traffickers and middlemen; to establish measures to discourage demand and confiscate the proceeds of the crime; to establish the criminal responsibility of any legal persons that take part in any phase of trafficking; to step up employment inspection and penalties for the exploitation of employees and illegal hiring of irregular immigrants; to strengthen the role of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders and of the immigration liaison officers in detecting the channels used by traffickers and their modus operandi
; and finally, strengthening the role of the joint investigation teams of the European Police Office (Europol) in combating the mafias. I would like to conclude by adding that the figure of the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator could make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives that I have mentioned, although his powers and capacities must be clearly defined in order to prevent actions from being duplicated or interference with the functions entrusted to Europol.

Mr President, the increase in asylum applications on behalf of citizens of Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia requires measures protecting the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. Visas are an instrument included in the framework of immigration policies; their purpose is to legalise the entry and temporary stay in a country where the applicant is neither a non-national nor a resident. Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 provides for an evaluation mechanism for visa extension, in which certain requirements in relation to illegal immigration, public order and security, the Union’s external relations, territorial cohesion and the principle of reciprocity must be fulfilled. This mechanism could also function in the opposite direction. Asylum, on the other hand, is an instrument of protection that cannot be used incorrectly. It should be pointed out that the purpose of the European Union’s common policy in this area is to preserve the integrity of asylum as an instrument of protection for the persecuted, prioritising the principles of the Geneva Convention and the New York Protocol, applying common criteria for the identification of people who genuinely require international protection and a guaranteed common minimum level of benefits in all Member States for the welfare of those people. Asylum is therefore an instrument of humanitarianism and solidarity and, hence, exclusive in its purpose and nature. This is why it is important that the European Union reacts and helps the Serbian and Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonian authorities to adopt sufficient measures regarding the requirements that must be fulfilled to benefit from refugee status or subsidiary protection status, thereby avoiding improper or fraudulent use of them.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members, Mrs Guillaume, Mr Ilchev, Mrs Keller, Mrs Wikström and Mr Tavares. The support they have given me has improved this report. I would specifically like to draw the Council’s and the Commission’s attention to the terminology. From my point of view, it would be more appropriate if we used the term ‘irregular immigration’. Up to now, clandestine immigration has been referred to as ‘illegal immigration’ in all the legislative instruments the EU has enacted. Although it is true that in some Member States, an irregular entry or stay constitutes a crime and in others, the term ‘irregular’ has no legal or semantic significance, in many other Member States, an irregular entry or stay does not constitute an unlawful act, which is why we should not generally criminalise these activities. For this reason, in the explanatory statement of the report, it is asked that the institutions revise the terminology that is used, insisting on the need to find a more precise and appropriate definition for the phenomenon of clandestine immigration. Moving on to the substance of this issue, the immigration liaison officers’ network was created by Council Regulation (EC) No 377/2004. This instrument states that the liaison officers will be representatives of a Member State posted abroad by the immigration service or other appropriate authority with the aim of establishing and maintaining contact with the authorities of the host country, aiming to contribute to the prevention and combat of clandestine immigration, the repatriation of irregular immigrants and the management of legal immigration. Since the enactment of the regulation, the Frontex Agency has been established, whose mission is to coordinate operational cooperation between Member States in the area of external border management; assist the Member States in the training of national border guards; carry out risk analyses; monitor the development of external border control and surveillance research; assist Member States in circumstances that require increased technical and operational assistance at external borders and provide them with the necessary support in the organising of joint return operations. It is evident that the important mission entrusted to Frontex could be achieved in a more efficient way if they could draw upon the knowledge and experience of the immigration liaison officers’ network, especially if we take into account the fact that the European Agency does not have offices or representatives outside EU territory. The proposed amendment to Regulation (EC) No 337/2004 aims to harness the knowledge and experience of the immigration officials for Frontex and vice versa, which was not included in the original regulation. Furthermore, the proposed amendment suggests accessing the information obtained by the liaison officers’ network through ICONet, which is a secure information and coordination network for the immigration management services of Member States, accessing the External Borders Fund to promote the creation of liaison officers’ networks and, finally, facilitating a mechanism for the presentation of reports on the activity of the network and the designation of named regions of interest in the area of immigration. The relevant legal bases of the proposal are Article 63(3)(b) and Article 66 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. I will stop there, Madam President, and will make further observations in the second round. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your words, and also for your commitment. I would once again like to express my admiration for the way that you are managing the portfolio with which you have been entrusted. There have been 18 speeches this afternoon, and the majority groups have supported this report. I would therefore like to reiterate my deep and heartfelt gratitude, because they have participated actively, enriching and amending substantive issues that should be included and are now included. I am essentially referring to the human rights chapter, the European Asylum Support Office and the role of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Obviously, in such a broad and diverse Chamber, we are not obliged to agree with one another, which is why the efforts that we have all made to reach a very broad consensus are particularly significant. Ladies and gentlemen, from a centre-right and Christian Democrat position, I am indeed saying that I am unequivocally in favour of the expression ‘irregular’, and that I reject the expression ‘illegal’, as legally, semantically and ethically inappropriate. Thank you very much to all my fellow Members for their support, and also for their speeches, including the dissenting ones. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Madam President, in order to mitigate the social and energy impact and to ensure secure energy reserves, we have tabled three amendments in plenary with the following aims: firstly, for the overall volume of aid per year to diminish, but with no percentage limit or limit per business. In this respect, we are grateful for Mr Langen’s position regarding removing fixed references and each Member State being able to decide according to their interests. The second aim is for aid to cover exceptional costs to be extended to 2030. Such proposals will help to alleviate the energy dependency of numerous EU countries, including Spain. They would ensure the continuation of indigenous production and the preservation of thousands of jobs on which significant regions of Spain and of Europe as a whole are largely dependent.

Mr President, I would like to make an announcement to the House. The Taiwanese Government has informed the Council, via the permanent representations, Parliament and the Commission, that from today, 11 November, it is establishing visa exemptions for Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania. Consequently, all 27 EU countries can enter Taiwanese territory without a visa. When the House votes in a moment, Mr President, I will take the opportunity to congratulate all the political groups for the support that they have given to this matter, as well as the Taiwanese people, the Taiwanese authorities, and their extremely strong diplomatic team.

Madam President, freedom and security are essential elements for the implementation of any current democratic legal structure, in which freedom uses security as the most valued tool for protection. The transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to third countries is an essential element of the transnational fight against terrorism and organised crime. It should be based on scrupulous compliance with EU rules on the protection of personal data, as laid down in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. For this reason, we must welcome the communication from the Commission on the global approach to transfers of PNR data to third countries and its recommendations that the Council authorises the opening of negotiations in this area with Australia, Canada and the United States, as both instruments take up Parliament’s concerns regarding security, defending fundamental rights and protecting personal data. However, it should be pointed out that PNR data cannot be used for profiling, which is why the Commission sought to clarify – in my view, successfully – the differences between the expressions ‘risk assessment’ and the aforementioned profiling. Moreover, the Commissioner said that checking will be done by humans rather than being automated. Well, we will see what happens. Madam President, we need a single, general, legally binding agreement to protect personal data. This top-level agreement must be implemented through sectoral agreements in order to combat terror and organised crime. As regards the need, Madam President, it is obvious. As regards proportionality, it must, in all cases, be an inalienable requirement. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

Commissioner, I would also like to send my regards to your excellent team. Ladies and gentlemen, Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the Union’s external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 that we are discussing today has three objectives: transferring Taiwan to the positive list, transferring other third countries or territories – Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau – to the positive list and the situation of the Northern Mariana Islands. The situation of the Northern Mariana Islands does not pose any problems, as its inhabitants are, as you are aware, US citizens.  With regard to the requests to transfer the third countries that I listed, the Commission finds no justification for removing the visa requirement, and neither do we. In the case of Taiwan, this Asian island has experienced commendable democratic, social and economic development. Democratic institutions have been firmly established since 1996, when the first direct presidential elections were held. The President is the Head of the Government, and is elected by the people of Taiwan via universal suffrage for a four-year term. Legislative power currently lies with the Legislative Yuan, which has 113 members. Economically, Taiwan’s income per head of population is one of the highest in the world at USD 30 100, in July 2010, unemployment stood at 5.2%, way below the European average, which was 10.1% in the same month. During the first quarter of 2010, economic growth hit 13.27%, whilst during the first half of 2010, the balance of trade surplus stood at USD 12.1 billion. Figures published by the International Monetary Fund in 2009 placed Taiwan’s economy 25th in the world, with a gross national product of USD 379 billion. It should be pointed out that in 1950, Taiwan was poorer than Ghana, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Until 1960, it was more reliant on commodities exports than countries like Kenya, South Africa and Lebanon. Today, however, products manufactured in Taiwan account for more than 97% of the country’s exports. All this has meant that Taiwan’s net migration rate stands at just 0.15%. For this reason, it is very unlikely that we will have to deal with any illegal immigrants from Taiwan. According to data supplied by the Commission, in 2006-2008, only 45 illegal immigrants throughout the entire European Union were found to have come from Taiwan. As far as the security of travel documents is concerned, I would like to point out that Taiwanese electronic passports meet all the anti-counterfeiting standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The situation of dispersed Taiwanese should be looked at closely, as even if they have passports issued by the authorities, they need prior authorisation to enter Taiwan. For this reason, it would seem logical for the European Union to maintain a similar approach regarding those people, as my report proposes. Currently, Taiwan does not require visas from the majority of the Member States, except for Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria. The Taiwanese authorities have nevertheless undertaken to ensure that a visa waiver is in place for nationals of those countries by 11 November, in other words, tomorrow. This is a formal commitment of which the Presidency of the Council, the European Commission and Parliament have been notified, along with the permanent representations of the countries concerned. For this reason, Mr President, and for other reasons which I shall mention in my second speech, it is worth us granting the visa exemption to Taiwan, as the United Kingdom and Ireland did last year.

Mr President, noblesse oblige
, so I would like to start by saying that I am infinitely grateful for the support that all fellow Members representing their political groups have given to the report that I have had the honour to present to the House. I would also like to thank you for supporting my work. It would not, however, be fair if I did not say that the person mainly responsible is Commissioner Malmström, whose support, energy and excellent team have made it possible to drive forward this action, which I would describe as an act of justice. There is nothing more to be said, Mr President, except to add that I would also like to congratulate the people of Taiwan, the Taiwanese authorities and, of course, the excellent team of diplomats that Taiwan has in the world, particularly in Brussels. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Fajon on producing a report that involved so much commitment in such a determined way. I would also like to congratulate my colleague and friend, Mrs Corazza Bildt, for her determination and passion in taking on the commitment of visa exemptions for Bosnia and Herzegovina and for Albania, two countries that desperately need them. Like you, I, too, was in Sarajevo and Mostar during the war, and I too witnessed Milosevic’s mass population displacements and the solidarity of the Albanians. That is why I am expressing my joy here today, Mr President, because, happily, justice is being done. Since the Salonica Summit in June 2003, when the European Union at last took the welcome step of committing to exempt the Western Balkans from visas, following the first stage when the two countries did not fulfil the requirements, we can now reaffirm and welcome the commitment that finally, Albanians and Bosnians are going to be able to travel to EU territory. Mr President, Commissioner, the need to bring stability to the Balkans, especially to countries that will certainly join the Union in the future, and to facilitate the mobility of a population that is currently isolated, must, in my view, be one of Parliament’s political obligations. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to condemn the degrading and anti-democratic treatment by Hugo Chávez’s government of those who defend freedom and human rights. The detention of my colleague, Mr Iturgaiz, at Caracas airport cannot be overlooked. It is not the first time that the regime has launched an attack on members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Our mission as Members of this House is not limited to within the EU. It also involves promoting the values on which the Union is based such as freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. It is evident that this task is not well received by those that seek to impose totalitarian ideas on their citizens. The result of the parliamentary elections held on 27 September leaves room for hope, although we should all be concerned about the reaction to the progress made by the Venezuelan opposition. What can we expect from a government that harbours terrorists from the Oker terrorist cell, of an executive body that includes an alleged ETA murderer as the head of security of the Venezuelan National Land Institute, or of a government that ignores extradition requests for numerous terrorists who have fled justice? Obviously, we can expect nothing. Madam President, such contemptible attitudes deserve a strong reaction and the firmest possible rejection by Parliament. President. -

 Mr President, the security situation in Iraq is growing more precarious by the day. Since Major-General al-Karawi was killed in the Anbar province last December, violence in the region has peaked with clashes between government forces and ISIL. Fallujah is under siege, cut off from humanitarian supplies, and its residents labelled terrorists by their own prime minister, which is ludicrous. And it is not just Sunnis who are targeted but other minorities too. In Camp Liberty members of the Iranian Resistance, whose asylum-seeker status has now been officially recognised by the United States in addition to the European Union, live at the mercy of Prime Minister al-Maliki and those who control him from Tehran. We know that a new massacre is being planned by Prime Minister al-Maliki in Camp Liberty. Heat-oriented missiles have been transported to Baghdad by Iranian Quds forces in collaboration with Prime Minister al-Maliki. We know it. The High Representative knows it and I suppose that the President of the Council also knows. Inaction or soft diplomacy is not an option when three thousand men and women are under deadly threat. It is time for the High Representative and the Member States to do something effective for once. (Applause) President. - 
 So you say the same independent of the hat you wear? Very well. President. −

 Madam President, just a warning in relation to the voting list of the PPE group. On Amendment 60, there is a separate vote in two parts. The first part, which is a roll-call vote, is marked as a key vote.

Mr President, I would like to say to Baroness Ashton that she knows very well that under cover of the conflict in Syria that is concentrating the attention of Western governments and public opinion, the Iraqi Government has initiated the final phase of the physical liquidation of the 3 000 members of the Iranian democratic opposition that reside in Iraq. In relation to this, Baroness Ashton, I ask you immediately to do the following. Tell Prime Minister Maliki that, if there is another murder or the seven hostages are not freed, this will have severe consequences at a diplomatic, financial and political level for him and we will take him to an international court to answer for these crimes. Organise, with the United Nations, blue helmet protection for Ashraf and call for an urgent meeting of foreign affairs ministers of the Union to accept refugees in their countries. Anything less than that is a waste of time. President. −

 Mr President, Mr Juncker, if I remember correctly, you are currently the most senior member of the prime ministers of the European Council. You have seen my country, Spain, evolve from being part of the euro solution to being a founder member, and to today unfortunately being part of the euro problem, due to the government’s mismanagement. The Spanish Government has undertaken some reforms, but these are clearly still not enough to regenerate confidence in our country, confidence that existed in the past and that will exist again in the future. What advice would you give the next prime minister following the forthcoming elections in Spain? What reforms do you believe we should continue to carry out in Spain in order to recover confidence in the euro area, over which you preside? Antonio López-Istúriz White  (PPE

Mr President, the European Union is founded on values such as equality, solidarity and respect for all languages. We all share these principles. As Spanish Members, we support the idea of having a patents system for the whole of the European Union, and I congratulate my colleague, Mr Lehne, on that part of the report. We support anything that improves and expands the internal market. However, for such an important matter, a course has been chosen that is provided for in the Treaty – enhanced cooperation – which should be the last resort and fulfil a series of conditions. In our view, enhanced cooperation, on which we will vote tomorrow, is contrary to Articles 118 and 326 of the Treaty. Moreover, I believe that in the Council, the rules of the game have been changed, but my government will deal with that. The new Treaty is an unquestionably useful tool for the EU, but it cannot be used to establish a multi-speed Europe. Many countries that currently support enhanced cooperation will soon suffer the consequences themselves and, if the Council and the Commission continue to use enhanced cooperation in this way, ultimately we will all lose. Spanish is spoken by 850 million people. Out of the three languages proposed by the European Commission for the patents system, only one of them is comparable to Spanish in terms of size. What criteria were used? Efficiency? Are we talking about EUR 1 850? Then why not use only English and leave the other two languages, so we will also save by doing it three times rather than 20 times. Is it about timing? It was not Spain that opposed a patent in the past, it was other countries, which are now rushing to have one. Is it to do with politics, as I suspect? Care should be taken with bureaucratic manoeuvres that distance millions of citizens – and thousands of businesses that use Spanish – from the reality of the European Union. The system proposed by the Commission is contrary to the right of Europeans to express themselves in their language, it prioritises one language over others, it is clear discrimination against competition, it fragments the market and creates legal uncertainty. This battle has only just begun. Due to the haste of some, we are going to be faced with a legal action lasting several years in the Court of Justice, as my government has already said. The three institutions will have to give an account of the procedure followed and of why the warnings were ignored. This situation can be remedied if we return to the spirit and the letter of the treaties, which Spain has respected. Antonio López-Istúriz White  (PPE
).

Mr President, I think that all of us who believe in the European Union have reason to congratulate ourselves, particularly in these times of economic and sometimes political crisis. I believe that we have moved forward. We are taking a big step with the creation and launch of this European External Action Service. I would like to congratulate not only the High Representative, but also those involved – such as, for example, within the European Parliament, our colleague Mr Brok – who have facilitated the achievement of the agreements that were necessary for this. I especially liked the phrase that you used, Baroness Ashton, about how it is the interests of the European Union that need to be defended above all. I would also say to you – this is not advice, simply a comment – taking the position of my colleague, Mr Salafranca, that what is needed here is effectiveness. Moreover, I would add humility and effectiveness, following the example that the President of the Council, Mr Van Rompuy, is giving to us. I am sure that you will succeed and, of course, as General Secretary of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to give you my support, together with that of our entire group, in this enormous task that you are faced with.

 Madam President, I am addressing my speech to Orlando Zapata’s mother and to those suffering along with him in the fight for freedom in Cuba: they are not alone. Today, through this resolution – for which, in my capacity as Secretary-General of my party, I would like to thank the authors, and especially all the parties that have signed it – Parliament is speaking out as one against this isolated and decrepit dictatorship. Today, we are signing the beginning of the international death sentence for this regime. I am convinced, based on the majority of the speeches that I have heard, that we are all united in firmly and clearly condemning the death of your son. Many of us, however, are going further than this statement: you can rest assured that we will remain vigilant in order to secure the unconditional release of all political prisoners on the island. We will remain vigilant regarding the situation of human rights violations on the island. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will, of course, fight to maintain the European Union’s common position, and I am sure based on what I have heard that many others will do the same. We will not give mixed signals, but rather a clear guide for achieving our dream of seeing a democratic Cuba. The supreme sacrifice made by Orlando has produced a response in the good consciences of the whole world. Let us ensure that the silent sacrifice of thousands of Cubans is celebrated in the near future in a free Cuba. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo

 Mr President, allow me to begin by expressing my thanks to the Secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, particularly Ms Leffler and others who collaborated with me to make this report possible, including Ms Martín, Mr Kox and Ms Remacle. Mr President, it is almost over a year since the Committee on Petitions decided to draw up a report on waste management in the EU. The decision was taken after it was established that large numbers of repeat petitions were being put forward, condemning the poor waste management carried out by the authorities, the location of certain rubbish dumps, the destruction of some natural areas, and so on. The Committee on Petitions was sensitive to these claims, and sent several fact-finding missions to the areas concerned in order to verify in situ
 the truth of the complaints made by the petitioners. All of this has led us here today, to the plenary session of the European Parliament, in order to make it clear that the proper application of current legislation by Member States is an unresolved issue that requires particular attention and on which we should remain vigilant. As I said at the beginning of my speech, most European citizens expect public authorities to provide efficient and effective public services in terms of health, education, transport and security. However, the issue that provokes a growing number of petitions is the apparent inability of public authorities in many countries to deal satisfactorily with the problem of waste management. The European Union has adopted a broad raft of legislation, applicable in all Member States, in order to ensure that the legal framework exists to deal with the inevitable result of our modern lifestyle in terms of all the things we discard as waste from our household, from our place of work, from our hospitals, from our industries and so on. It is obvious to all that failure to manage such issues, and failure to prioritise efforts in this respect, produces not only negative effects on human health and well-being, but also on the viability of the planet and its environment. Judging by the petitions received, the concern of many local communities is growing, and this indicates that waste management is becoming a major political and social problem and people expect the European Union to deal with it somehow. An analysis of the waste management policies implemented in the Member States provides very contrasting information and serious breaches of EU legislation. The Commission reported in January 2011 that 177 infringement cases concerning landfills had been launched since the deadline for implementing the Landfill Directive in 2001. They had furthermore calculated that there were at the very least 619 illegal landfills still being used in the EU. In its strategic report on the prevention and recycling of waste, the Commission clearly demonstrates that it is using its best efforts to address the issue of waste management, and it also outlines its medium-term proposals. It should be recalled in this context, Mr President, that the large number of infringement cases mentioned aim at ensuring legal compliance, yet from the petitioners’ perspective, more effort needs to be made to ensure proper follow-up actions in the actual implementation of the law. Closely linked to the waste management process, although upstream of the process, are the EU directives dealing with environmental impact assessments and the access of citizens to information concerning the environment. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Georgieva for her interesting opinions and also my fellow Members who have participated in this debate. To some of the latter, I would like to say that comments have been made about the appropriateness or otherwise of holding this debate in the Committee on Petitions, and of referring the matter on from that Committee to this House. With your permission, Mr President, I would like to commend and defend the Committee on Petitions as an appropriate setting in which to debate these issues. I say this given that those who submitted petitions, the citizens of the European Union, have addressed the Committee on Petitions. Apart from the fact that citizens can address other committees, such as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and bearing in mind that opinions may be developed and reports drawn up in other committees, I think that when citizens approach the Committee on Petitions, they want us to respond and provide a solution to their problems. Clearly, we cannot look the other way or divert attention. Were we to do so, there would be no point to the work and actions of the Committee on Petitions within the European Parliament or, indeed, to the very existence of that Committee. In addition, I would like to say to certain colleagues that the petitions have referred systematically to the constant deficiencies that occur with waste management and to the real, habitual inability of the Member States to fulfil their legal obligations. This really is the way things are at present. These thoughts and problems have also been included in the report, however, hence the request for the Member States to transpose the Waste Management Directive without further delay, and to guarantee that all its provisions are fully complied with, especially through the establishment and application of comprehensive waste management plans. Therefore, Mr President, I believe that through this report and Ms Georgieva’s own words, a very direct course has been set to try to resolve all the problems that have been outlined by the groups, many problems that are related to this issue, but I also believe that it needs to be emphasised that delaying is not an option, nor can a blind eye be turned, when it comes to resolving the many, many issues and petitions that are being received from countries throughout the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pass on a message to you all from Oswaldo Payá, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize by Parliament. ‘Dear friends, the people of Cuba want change, they want to enter peacefully into a new phase of their lives, leaving behind anything that involves hate, violence, repression, lies and fear, opening themselves up to reconciliation and ready to take the path of progress in every respect. These changes, which are being imposed on us by law, are already present in the hearts and minds of the Cuban people, but the civil and political rights of the people need to be respected. There need to be free and democratic elections, and freedom to travel, work and participate in the economic, political and cultural life of the country. Changes are rights, and those rights are lacking in Cuba, where many people are still being persecuted for promoting the rights of the Cuban people and also imprisoned for that cause. The European common position is focused on solidarity and that position should be maintained. You should know that although the Cuban Government is not initiating the changes that many Cubans who are supporting the Varela Project and other civil initiatives desire, there are people working to achieve these peaceful changes at the moment. These are the initiatives that you must support, while remaining consistent with the common position so that it is also a joint approach.’ Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, it is my pleasure to come here, as we do every year, to present the annual report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions during the year 2009. As you know, this year, the activity of the Committee on Petitions was marked by the change from the sixth to the seventh parliamentary term, which has meant significant alterations to the composition of the committee, since two thirds of its members are involved for the first time. The report aims to offer a clear vision of the activity of the Committee on Petitions during the year and, ultimately, a more specific explanation of what submitting a petition to the European Parliament involves, as well as the possible result of the process, what it can achieve and its limitations. This report also examines the progress made in applying previous recommendations whose objective was to improve the committee’s work, and highlights the main challenges for the future in light of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, as well as confirming the right to petition the European Parliament as one of the pillars of European citizenship, has also established the necessary bases for increasing public participation in the European Union’s decision-making process, offering Europeans the opportunity to suggest improvements or additions to the Union’s legislation. To this end, the Committee on Petitions welcomes the fact that it is able, under Rule 50 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, to work alongside the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on drawing up the report on the European Citizens’ Initiative, which should be finished late this year. Moreover, following the same context of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament’s Committee on Petitions should forge closer working links with similar committees in Member States’ national and regional parliaments in order to promote mutual understanding of petitions on European issues and to ensure the swiftest response to members of the public at the most appropriate level. I would also draw your attention to the legally binding force acquired by the Charter of Fundamental Rights with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and underline the importance of the Charter in making fundamental rights clearer and more visible to all Europeans. I trust that all necessary procedural steps will be taken to ensure that the institutional aspects of EU accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will be taken. This goal is of vital importance if we take into account the problem of violations of property rights that the Committee on Petitions faces in certain Member States on a daily basis, knowing that neither the committee nor Parliament is in a position to take any legal action. I would also stress the excellent relations that Parliament has with the European Ombudsman. We particularly appreciate the efforts of the European Ombudsman to raise public awareness of its work, as well as to identify and resolve cases of maladministration by the European institutions. To this end, we support the idea that the European Ombudsman should establish an administrative code of conduct for the European Union administration. We call for the development of an online system that clearly indicates the various complaints mechanisms available to the public and which of these is most appropriate to their interests; the establishment of an online one-stop shop would be needed in order to achieve this. However, not everything was going to be positive. I would like to take this opportunity to protest at the practice – which has been constant since 2007 – of the Directorate-General for the Presidency and the Directorate-General for Communication, whereby items that are not petitions are registered as petitions, according to Rule 201(1) of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. I am talking about the so-called ‘non-petitions’. Processing them is an unnecessary waste of time, on top of the cost of dedicating staff to this. In order for you to realise the importance of this point, I will give you one figure: these so-called ‘non-petitions’ are up to 25% of the petitions registered. The practice of such maladministration endangers the rights of EU citizens. Finally, but no less important because of that, I would point out the need to adopt a code of conduct for the internal processing of petitions. To this end, I would encourage the secretariat and the representatives of the political groups to work on drawing up a revised guide for the benefit of Members on the internal regulations and procedures of the Committee on Petitions. In conclusion, my final words – and how could it be any other way, Mr President – are of thanks to the committee’s secretariat for its work and support in drawing up this report. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, thank you to all of the Members for their contributions. I believe that there is a thread running through all the speeches given by my fellow Members. This thread is the importance of the Committee on Petitions, because the faith and hopes of thousands of Europeans that their principal and real problems can be solved often rest on this committee. That is why, of all the committees, the Committee on Petitions – and several Members have said this – is the one that has the most direct relationship with the public, as Europeans are directly involved in it. The significance of this committee means that it must be safeguarded and loose ends tied up, so that all of us – Parliament, the Commission and the petitioners – may feel that the committee is even more useful. With your consent, Mr President, I will finish by asking the Commissioner to take note. I know that the Commissioner will do so, because many of the complaints that we have heard from fellow Members are completely justified. The following comments that have been made are totally justified: there is a lack of information, and it is true that certain petitions have been paralysed and were not completed. I therefore believe that we must not be distracted but must see the issue through to the end. Those petitions that have been initiated, and which remain open and with unresolved issues, must be resolved. I believe that in your capacity as Commissioner, you must make efforts to try to solve the complaints that you have heard here in this House today. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

 Mr President, a Spanish Central Criminal Court judge has confirmed what many of us were already aware of, namely that Hugo Chávez, the President of Venezuela, cooperates with ETA and FARC terrorists. This proves that Mr Chávez is in cahoots with terrorists, that he gives sanctuary to murderous terrorists on Venezuelan soil, and that he helps them by bestowing official positions in the Venezuelan Government upon them. Essentially, Mr Chávez is cooperating with ETA criminals. As a Basque, a Spaniard and a European, I wish to denounce and condemn the appalling attitude of the dictator Hugo Chávez. I urge the European institutions to take all necessary measures to condemn Mr Chávez and thus also condemn his policies in support of terrorists. I would also remind Mr Rodríguez Zapatero’s government, which currently holds the rotating Presidency of the European Union, that there is no point in being friendly and wishy-washy with Mr Chávez as it has been to date. There is no point either in displays of affection, or in friendly gestures and cooperation, because when the Spanish Government goes back on its word and humbles itself before Mr Chávez as it has done recently, this is tantamount to punishing the victims of terrorism, disdaining the Spanish justice system and thereby punishing freedom and democracy. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE
).  
– (ES)
 Mr President, I regret that some of those present in the House today should opt to congratulate Mr Chávez, who is in cahoots with terrorists and has included ETA leaders in his government. My group and I, faced with a choice between Mr Chávez and a Central Criminal Court judge like Mr Velasco from a state governed by the rule of law, have no hesitation in supporting that Central Criminal Court judge. Furthermore, if Mr Rodríguez Zapatero were to stop being all matey with Mr Chávez and humbling himself before him, and instead treated Mr Chávez as what he is, a terrorist supporter, the credibility of Spanish foreign policy on the international arena would be enhanced. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to condemn in this House the continual provocations, abuses of power and threats by the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez. With his dictatorial method of government he is threatening, among other things, freedom of expression in Venezuela and democratic order in Latin America. President Chávez has closed down thirty radio stations and some television channels. He is threatening and punishing journalists in Venezuela because they do not support his autocratic regime. Because of all this, Mr President, it should also be pointed out that while there are power cuts, water shortages and food shortages in Venezuela, and poverty is continuing to grow due to poor management by the Chávez Government, the Venezuelan tyrant is trying to cover it all up by blowing up border bridges and threatening Colombia. He is praising international terrorists and aligning himself with the despotic dictators of the world, and his words and speeches are continual provocations and war cries aimed at destabilising the American continent. This is why Parliament, which is always committed to freedom and democracy in any part of the world, must strongly condemn the autocratic and dictatorial policies of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

Mr President, I would like my first words to be words of congratulation, as is only right, to Mrs Paliadeli, on the report she has presented, first of all before the Committee on Petitions and now here in plenary. I would also like to endorse the very sensible comments made by Mrs Gruny and Mrs Mazzoni, my colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), but, Mr President, I would like to add that the role of the Ombudsman is essential in a democratic institution. That is the conclusion that we in the Committee on Petitions have drawn, during the many visits by Mr Diamandouros to present his annual reports, like the one we are today examining in this House, or other reports within his remit. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not propose to drown you in numbers. However, although progress has been made in the role of the Ombudsman, I have no doubt that if we were to conduct a survey of European citizens on the role of the Ombudsman, his work and his activities, we would unfortunately find that citizens see him as remote and, in many cases, are not even aware of his existence. Perhaps this is because the Ombudsman’s decisions are not binding, as he himself reminded us here, or perhaps because his work is very restricted as far as the Member States are concerned, as Mr Diamandouros has pointed out in this House. However, if we want to provide a service to citizens, then this institution – the European Parliament – and the Committee on Petitions must make an effort to strengthen and promote the work of the Ombudsman. While there are certainly many petitions, as has been pointed out here, especially on the lack of transparency, I am sure that the proper provision of information – such as the new website, which is now working, which I welcome – would make a much greater contribution, and I would like to insist on this point, to the objective that, I think, will be endorsed by all: that all citizens of the European Union should be aware of and be able to contact the Ombudsman. For this reason, I wish the Ombudsman all the luck in the world and every success, because his successes will be the successes of European citizens as a whole. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

Mr President, I would be pleased if certain left-wing Members of this Parliament who are issuing resolute condemnations of Honduras would issue similarly forceful condemnations of what is happening in Cuba, or what Mr Chávez is doing in Venezuela and in Latin America, because, unfortunately, some people still hanker after and support the Berlin Wall, the purges of Stalin and even the mummy of Lenin more than democratic elections in a country, as in this case in Honduras. Having said this, with the forthcoming elections, some serious thought should be given to what has happened in this Central American country. Mr President, presidential elections in Honduras were called 16 months ago. The members of the electoral court, which is the body responsible for managing elections, were appointed before 28 June – they were therefore appointed under Mr Zelaya’s mandate. The six presidential candidates went through the primaries procedure, and the majority of the candidates want the elections in Honduras to be held. Therefore, why do some people not want to recognise the electoral process, if it was the natural outcome, whether or not Mr Zelaya was in power in Honduras? On 30 October, the negotiators of both sides made a commitment, it is true, by signing an agreement, to seek a solution to the crisis. The agreement contained a set of key points supported by both sides. The negotiators of the deposed President Zelaya did not establish, however, who should head the government of unity. It is therefore clear that the European People’s Party is in favour of the elections being held, under conditions of transparency, democracy and freedom, and we are going to support them with observers from our group. Let us not forget that it was the mediator, Óscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, who requested that they should go. In reply to a question from the delegation for Central America, he answered that it was necessary to send them, because the Óscar Arias Foundation itself was going to send observers to Honduras. We are going to do precisely that, because the international mediator, Óscar Arias, is also requesting it. Carlos Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

Mr President, this summer, the terrorist group ETA murdered three people in Spain, three people who defended law and freedom: an officer of the national police and two officers of the civil guard. I would like to express our solidarity, support and care to their families. ETA is a criminal group that has no place in Europe, because in the European Union there is no room for radicalism, totalitarianism or terrorist murders. The European Parliament and all the European institutions should therefore continue to condemn the ETA terrorists and continue to work to remove and eradicate the cancer of terrorist attacks by ETA and its accomplices from our continent I therefore want my first speech in this first ordinary plenary sitting of the European Parliament of this legislature to remember and pay tribute to all the victims of ETA terrorism, to condemn the terrorist organisation ETA in this House and to ask that, as Europeans, we all work together, with the law on our side, to smoke out ETA and its supporters, for the good of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.

Mr President, I want to concentrate on Ms Patrão’s report on shark fishing, and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate her on her excellent work and her spirit of collaboration. Having said that, there are not many others to be congratulated, particularly the European Commission, because this proposal is a clear demonstration of what should never happen in the fisheries sector. Its partisan approach and the clear lack of consensus contradict the principles of the next reform, especially the bottom-up decision-making process involving consultation – of both the sector involved and civil society – in order to reach a compromise. Commissioner, a compromise on measures that have such a serious impact on a fleet’s future cannot just be a compromise between you and the NGOs. You have positioned yourself exclusively on their side and that means that the Commission is working in the interests of one part of civil society, yet there is no compromise with those who are affected. I, personally, have been very much involved in this matter and have worked tirelessly with the sector to convince it of the need to relax its initial positions so that no one could object to the final proposals. I have done the same with the NGOs, but it has proved impossible because they knew that the Commission was on their side. Why, therefore, would they want to seek a compromise? In relation to what you said about the international dimension, Commissioner, I have just attended a meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICAAT), at which every single resolution on sharks was rejected, including one like the text that you are proposing: the debate on it lasted not even a minute and, indeed, the European Commission did not even say anything. Therefore, Commissioner, do you believe that under these circumstances it is necessary to condemn a fleet in the face of its competitors? Would it not have been much better to wait for ICAAT to take a decision? I would like to ask you to state publicly here that no finning takes place in the European Union. This is because of the comments during the NGOs’ campaign of lies. I would ask you to state whether or not there is any finning in the European Union. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE
).

Mr President, I believe that the Commissioner is also here to answer our questions. I asked her to state publicly whether or not the removal of fins, or finning, is common practice in the EU fleet, as many Members have said. I would like her to say whether or not that is true.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the rapporteurs for their reports, but may I highlight the excellent collaboration with Mr Gallagher, which has led to the adoption at first reading, with the agreement of all the institutions, of measures that will enable swift action to be taken to put an end to unsustainable situations, such as we are experiencing with Iceland and the distribution of mackerel stocks. With regard to the Stevenson report on the common organisation of the market (CMO), I shall make particular reference to the chapter on consumer information, to which Commissioner Damanaki referred, in which I believe the compromises reached clarify and simplify the original proposal. Commissioner, I believe that proposal confused quantity of information with quality of information, since it would – as in the case of Article 42(2) – call for a whole series of data to be given, complicating and unnecessarily increasing the costs to the industry, without being of any relevance to consumers, who would also be incapable of assimilating so many details. We have also tried to find a balance between the interests of the various segments of the fleet and industry. For example, the obligation to show the date of catch is in the interests of the smaller-scale fishing fleets but is very detrimental for the other fleets catching fresh fish, without affecting the quality of the catch. Replacing it with the date of landing, as included in the compromise reached, gives the consumer the same guarantees while allowing the date of catch to be included as part of the voluntary information, if so wished. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I want to thank the Commissioner for attending. I hope he can hear me. I can see the Commissioner leaving, which is really depressing, as what he said and the solution he proposed in this notorious compromise he supports so much is a solution that is totally against the principles of the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU). That is why I would have liked the Commissioner to hear this debate. Moreover, the problem is that the Commission is handling all of this in a secretive, clandestine manner. It has been pure chance that some Members of Parliament, such as myself, have found out what has been going on. Neither the Commissioner for the Environment nor the Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries have ever been here to raise this issue when they know that the fight against IUU fishing is an absolute priority for us in Parliament. I would also like to know the reasons behind supporting the interests of countries involved in chartering ships, such as Brazil, New Zealand, Australia and the United States, when the price to pay will be to void Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, the objective of which is to combat illegal fishing. It will also weaken the European Union’s position in each and every international forum. That is the way it is. This issue precisely began to unravel in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). I also want to emphasise what has already been said, which is that this sets a very serious precedent, because all of this, as he said himself, will now be an issue for debate in all the international forums, especially in the regional fisheries organisations. Coincidentally, this will be discussed in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, given that it is one of the regional fisheries organisations where the most chartering occurs. It should not be forgotten that the philosophy on which the fight against IUU fishing is based is precisely the double safety net of state control over the port and flag state control over worldwide fishing catches. That is what has sown the seeds of panic in the exporting countries, which have suddenly seen the attractive EU market close. That is the root of all these problems. I hope, therefore, that this will be fully resolved by other means. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, unlike my colleagues, I believe that Parliament has managed to achieve a text for first reading that is very balanced between the measures needed for protection and recovery of the bluefin tuna agreed with the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), maintaining fleet activity and the strengthening of control measures. To do so, the Committee on Fisheries has removed some of the rapporteur’s extreme proposals, which would have led to the halting of the activity of the fleet of European vessels, and only European vessels, with the disastrous socio-economic consequences that would have been incurred. It is worth remembering that since 2006, there have been successive recovery plans for bluefin tuna, and as well as the fact that to change the game rules half way through and for only the European fleet would be unfair and discriminatory, it is doubtful the sustainability of the resource would benefit, given that the rest of the fleets could continue to operate. Lastly, I would like to insist on the need to shorten the period for the transposition of the recommendations adopted in the headquarters of the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) into EU law. In this case, the delay has been due to the incomprehensible opposition of the European Commission and some of Parliament’s groups to including provisions for implementing acts in the article of the regulation, which had reasonably been requested by the Council, with the aim of achieving legal security when it comes to the interpretation of particular technical aspects that could impede compliance with the control obligations set by ICCAT. Our political group, therefore, will oppose Parliament’s unilateral declaration proposed in Amendment 4. Carmen Fraga Estévez,

 Mr President, the fact that we are currently within the extension period of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Morocco is simply because the Commission did not fulfil its obligation at the time by requesting a negotiating mandate or reporting the agreement well in advance if it was not being fulfilled. This is nothing to do with the fishing fleet: they are neither responsible nor should they have to suffer the consequences. Therefore, I strongly advocate resolving this situation by ratifying it. I do not agree with those who oppose it, whether it is for the political issues in the Sahara, or the negative results in the fishing evaluation report. In that regard, I would like to refer back to 2006 and my report on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco when this Chamber was very firm both in terms of the benefits that the Saharan people should receive, as well as denouncing a disastrous negotiation, the loopholes in which have led to the poor results. I would stress, however, that I do not think any of these issues are going to be resolved by sending the fishing fleet home. On the contrary, I think we should look at the future of our fishing relationship with Morocco. Furthermore, Commissioner, we are again in the situation where there are less than three months of the extension period remaining and there is still no negotiating mandate. The sector is again plunged into uncertainty, but this time it has taken the initiative and acted responsibly alongside the Moroccan fishing sector and, with the agreement of their respective administrations, together they have drawn up an action plan for the future, which was delivered to you in Brussels last week. This is the reason why Mr Haglund, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and I, on behalf of my group, have tabled an oral question and a motion for a resolution which look to the future, a future based on new foundations which try to make up for the mistakes that were made and which have the approval of all interested parties. I simply request that the Commission is … (The President cut off the speaker) Carmen Fraga Estévez,

 Mr President, while we are waiting for proposed reforms of the common fisheries policy (CFP), the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wishes to express its alarm, once again, at the economic state of the fisheries sector. Until the proposal for its new common organisation of markets is tabled, the sector will continue to have almost no room for manoeuvre when setting prices. The rules on imports, many of which originate with illegal fishing, remain unfair competition for EU production: new monitoring obligations require companies to mobilise more of their resources and the general crisis does not exactly encourage increased consumption of quality products. To this must be added the upward trend in fuel prices, which is once again threatening companies that have already managed to survive the crisis of 2008. Far-reaching reforms of the CFP are envisaged and, in light of that, and in a context of ever decreasing structural aid, many companies could need liquidity to restructure or adapt themselves with a view to 2013. That is why we have tabled this oral question and this motion for a resolution before the House, given that this aid does not cost the EU budget anything and that, furthermore, the increase in aid being requested falls far short of the de minimis
 aid received by other sectors, such as transport or agriculture. We do not want to see ourselves in a situation like that in 2008, when we debated the package of measures adopted in extremis
 by Commissioner Borg. I would also like to say something to you, Commissioner: it is true that there are some Member States that will and others that will not be able to give this aid, and that, according to you, this will create disparity. However, greater disparity is created by the fact that some Member States do not cofinance the European Fisheries Fund, and that is something that is generally accepted. What needs to be proposed is aid, and any Member States wishing to defend their sectors will also be able to defend them. Carmen Fraga Estévez,

 Mr President, I must begin by regretting once again the complications that this report has encountered because of the resistance of the Council and the Commission to accepting Parliament’s powers of co-decision. In this case, we have a proposal for Greenland, as an overseas country and territory, to be able to export under the same conditions as those applied to a European Union Member State. This situation would benefit both Greenland, which exports 87% of its fisheries products to the European Union, and the Union; Denmark in particular, which is the recipient of the majority of these exports. One of the conditions for including Greenland in the single market import arrangements is that it should accept EU health rules, and this does not pose a problem in the least. Despite the trade in fisheries products being subject to the common organisation of the market, the Commission, using the need for compliance with health rules as an excuse, tabled its proposal based on Article 203 of the Treaty, which meant a simple and straightforward consultation procedure for us. Both the Committee on Fisheries and the legal services pointed out this anomaly from the outset. However, as it presents no problems in terms of content, and given its importance to Greenland, we are allowing the report to be processed under the consultation procedure. Imagine our surprise when, just as we were about to vote on the text and without prior warning, the Council adopted a completely different proposal, with numerous changes attempting to obscure the clear link with the common organisation of the market and so avoid co-decision. Since Parliament had – as I said before – already adopted the text using the consultation procedure without any problems, such manoeuvring was uncalled-for. Nevertheless, as we were faced with a new text, and given the clear proof that the Council’s goal was to erode Parliament’s powers, we decided that, this time, we would use those powers to the full and request a formal opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs. In that opinion, the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs was – and I am quoting directly from the text – that ‘the purpose of the proposed decision is to require Greenland to transpose EU health rules as a condition for the application of the EU internal market rules as regards fisheries’, as specified in Article 3 of the proposal itself, which guarantees that the agreement’s rules will be adapted to the applicable rules established in the Union as regards animal health and food safety, as well as the common organisation of the market in fishery products. Consequently, the Committee on Legal Affairs came to the unanimous decision that Articles 204 and 43(2) of the Treaty, along with Protocol No 34, which includes specific arrangements and procedures for products subject to the common organisation of the market in fishery products in Greenland, should form the legal basis for the proposal. Therefore, as rapporteur, I drew up another draft report, modifying the legal basis. That is what we are tabling for adoption tomorrow and, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, it is our first reading. All, then, that remains is for me to tell the Commission and the Council – which I believe to be absent – that they now have an opportunity to correct and recognise the new legal basis, and, therefore, to consider this the first reading, as we will be doing tomorrow. The problem is with the legal basis and not the content. I call for this problem to be solved with a view to the future. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur. 
− (ES)
 Mr President, I should like to give special thanks to the Commissioner for the answer she gave to my question, saying that she would be ready to accept the change to the legal basis, and I hope that the Council will also follow the same line that the Commissioner has set out. In any case, I had been considering the possibility of asking for this report to be returned to committee before it reached the final vote, but I later thought better of it and realised that it could only delay even further this proposal, which I believe is positive for Greenland and for the European Union, and that it would be advisable not to delay it more. I hope, anyhow, that the Council will go along with the intentions of the Committee on Fisheries, which are entirely justified, and I hope that a solution will be reached, given that the only problem is the legal basis and not the content. In any case, I am pleased that we have achieved this result; moreover, we always have the option of going to the Court of Justice if we see that it is advisable to continue with this matter. Anyhow, we will demonstrate goodwill tomorrow, by issuing our opinion, and we hope that the Council will respond and consider this Parliament’s first reading, as I have said. Therefore, thank you to the Commissioner for being prepared to cooperate on this issue in a straightforward way, and thanks to all my colleagues who have worked on and supported this report. All that remains is to hope that the Council will go along with our intentions, which are justified, as I have said, and endorsed not only by the Committee on Legal Affairs but also by the legal services of the European Parliament.

 Mr President, the Protocol of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Mauritania is due to expire on 31 July 2012. In view of the importance of this Protocol, the Commission has already asked the Council for a mandate for its renegotiation. We have been informed that the Council is currently studying a mandate proposal and will decide shortly. On the strength of Article 218 of the Treaty, which grants Parliament special powers in the final approval of fisheries agreements, we have already voiced our intent to make full use of the possibilities granted to us by the Treaty and the interinstitutional framework agreement to participate in shaping fisheries agreements, with the right to full information on an equal footing with the Council. We believe we should be involved in the process from the moment when the negotiating mandate is approved. The Fisheries Commission has thus decided to introduce a new procedure starting with the Mauritania Protocol, whereby we will submit an oral question and receive information on the future negotiations from the onset of the process. The procedure will also allow us to produce a draft resolution setting out our concerns on the agreement in issue – in this case, Mauritania – with the request that they be taken on board by the negotiators and ultimately become part of the final Protocol. The agreement with Mauritania is crucial both for the country itself and for the European Union. For Mauritania, it represents 29% of the national budget; for the European Union, it is one of the three mixed agreements still in force, allowing the presence of several different modes of fishing in the country’s waters, all of them vital for EU fish supplies. The significance of this agreement and the experience we have built up have prompted us to put forward a number of suggestions that will be reflected in the common resolution set to be negotiated by the political groups in the coming days, and also to voice a number of concerns on the way in which the current Protocol works. These concerns include the following: Firstly, Parliament must understand the importance of securing the industry’s support for the financial contributions and their correct use, bearing in mind the needs of both the industry and the Mauritanian fishing authorities in making headway towards an advanced, sustainable fisheries policy. Secondly, the joint scientific committee has a key role to play and care must be taken that it fulfils this role properly, as it is the body responsible for assessing resources and issuing recommendations on the biological status of populations, and therefore on the fishing opportunities available to the different fleets operating in Mauritanian waters. Thirdly, more information is needed on the catches of other non-EU countries operating in the area, so that we can accurately establish the real fisheries surplus that Mauritania can offer the EU, while also ensuring that the fishing opportunities negotiated are in line with the actual needs of the fleets. This will avoid any temptations to pay for ‘paper fish’. Fourthly, it is important, as far as the fishing fleet is concerned, to ensure that the technical measures for the different fisheries are negotiated at the same time as the fishing opportunities, thus putting an end to the absurdity of paying for resources that are technically impossible to catch. Lastly, urgent clarification is needed of Mauritania’s use of the Protocol’s monitoring provisions as regards its preference for methods other than the vessel monitoring system (VMS), and also its varying standards on ship arrests. It is important that both parties respect the agreed terms for the resolution of disputes in connection with such arrests, which must be preserved in the new Protocol. Commissioner, for all these reasons, we will be asking that the Commission, as the negotiator, takes into consideration these and other concerns, which will form part of the common resolution set to be approved at the next plenary session, and which our institution will follow very closely. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.

Mr President, Commissioner, exemption from the rules of origin is based on a very serious calculation error by the Commission regarding its impact, not only on the EU tuna sector, which is very serious, but also on the Pacific region, which we are seeking to help. Meanwhile, the real beneficiaries are almost exclusively the greedy fleets from China and South-East Asia and their processing industries. The Directorate-General for Trade established this exemption based on the fact that Papua New Guinea does not have the fishing capacity to exploit its resources. However, according to the most recent data from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, there are 41 seiners under Papua New Guinea flags operating in the area, which, in 2009, had a catch total of almost 500 000 tonnes. Out of this catch, more than 75 000 tonnes ended up in the European Union (semi-processed and processed), which makes Papua New Guinea one of the six main exporters to the European Union. It is not, therefore, true, as you say, that in order to develop Papua New Guinea’s fishing sector, other fleets needed to be given free entry. Under no circumstances can the European Union shirk its commitment to sustainable development. However, we are seeing that, under the protection of this exemption, and in order to bring in Asian investors, Papua New Guinea has amended its legislation so that it is not possible to make complaints about environmental damage, and has implemented investment rules that allow local workers and cheap labour from Asia to be hired, along with the worst imaginable labour standards. If we add to this the fact that, in the regional fisheries organisation that I mentioned, Papua New Guinea is leading other countries in flatly refusing to sign up to any international rules to manage and control fisheries, the result is that, while the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries is going the whole hog to combat illegal fishing, others are opening their doors to it. Commissioner, I have just come back from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, and I am well aware of the position that Papua New Guinea has taken. I therefore maintain the position of the Committee on Fisheries of asking for the exemption to be suspended in the review of the agreement that we are discussing. Carmen Fraga Estévez,

Mr President, thank you very much to the authors of the reports for their excellent work. I would like to focus on management plans, although I will not go into any substantial aspects, as they have already been highlighted by the rapporteurs. Instead, I will refer to the significant institutional challenges they are creating, which must be resolved. After more than a year of negotiations with the Council, Parliament has quite responsibly decided to bring the reports to first reading with the aim of exerting pressure to break the current deadlock, which affects not only these two proposals but also all the others that are to be put before us in the near future. Parliament is willing to find a compromise solution with the Council and the Commission but the key requirement for that to happen is for the Council to acknowledge and accept that the basic core of long-term management plans must fall under the ordinary legislative procedure, that is, under the legal basis of Article 43(2) of the treaty. It is incomprehensible that before the Treaty of Lisbon, when the Council also had exclusive competence in matters of TAC and quotas, Parliament was asked for its consultative opinion, whereas now, the Council claims exclusivity on these same matters, even though, according to all legal advice, Article 43(3) must be interpreted restrictively. I therefore urge the Commissioner to take account of Parliament’s position, even if any proposals – and I believe Mrs Bilbao’s question on this particular point has not been answered – were to be withdrawn or replaced by new texts. Failure to do this will compel us to refer the matter to the Court of Justice and to block future long-term plans, which is to be avoided insofar as it is a basic instrument of fisheries management. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, allow me to express my gratitude to the Council and the Commission for arriving at this excellent agreement at first reading, and I would particularly like to thank the legal services of all three institutions for their cooperation and help in resolving the problems arising from the new committee procedure following the Treaty of Lisbon. I believe that we have reached a good compromise, especially as it represents significant progress compared with the current situation, although, as in any compromise, we have all had to make concessions and be flexible, in what has been an especially complex task, as the Commission proposal arrived before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This meant that at the same time, it had to be adapted to the new situation, in particular, to Articles 290 and 291 of the treaty, relating to delegated acts and implementing acts. As this is a transposition into EU legislation of recommendations issued by a regional fisheries organisation, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) in this case, but which will be followed by many others, Parliament’s objective was fundamentally to establish a mechanism which would enable the transpositions to take place as quickly as possible, preventing internal bureaucratic delays from preventing us from responding correctly to our international obligations, as has been the case so far. Therefore, the new wording of Article 48, following the compromise reached with the Council on the subsequent amendments to this regulation, will enable the Commission both to comply with the obligations imposed by the NEAFC and to adapt to new recommendations that may arise in the future, through the delegation of powers. It is true that the Commission wanted it to be possible to revise all the articles in the proposal through delegated acts, and the compromise agrees that this will be the case for the majority of the articles, except in areas such as the recording of catches, tranships, inspections or monitoring of infringements: in other words, fundamentally matters relating to control and supervision, which will remain outside the framework of the ordinary legislative procedure. In any case, Commissioner, Parliament commits to amending this procedure if it is shown that the inclusion of these aspects within the scope of the ordinary legislative procedure could endanger compliance with the European Union’s obligations and, especially, those of the Commission, as a contracting party to the regional fisheries organisation. This is why we consider that this compromise represents a significant step forward, not only in relation to this specific proposal, but in order to lay the foundations for future discussions between the Council, the Commission and Parliament on fisheries policy. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that I believe that the example set by this most recent regulation on the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), which we are going to adopt tomorrow, is not a good one, because what has happened is precisely what we want to avoid. The Commission put forward the proposal late and the procedure has changed, as we have changed from the consultation procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure, and the proposal as a whole has been changed in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. That is exactly what we are avoiding through this compromise. Through the new wording of Article 48 of the regulation, which is the article that provides for the amendment of the regulation in future in order to transpose the various NEAFC recommendations into EU law, in the majority of the articles, we have delegated powers to the European Commission. We have only maintained and preserved the ordinary legislative procedure in a few areas, which was the compromise with the Council. A significant step forward has therefore been taken to ensure that this functions in the future, but even so, Commissioner, I have made a public commitment here that if, in the future, it does not function adequately and we are prevented from fulfilling our obligations, Parliament will be prepared to revise the procedure. I believe that we have made quite a considerable effort, and I think that this is a significant step forward as a starting point. We are sure that the Commission will be capable of using the new powers that the Council and Parliament has granted to it. Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner. I am sure that this is going to work much better than what we had in the past. Of course, Commissioner, you are the one who is going to have the tools to ensure that this is the case.

Mr President, this report originated as a response to the frustration and lack of defence of the EU fishing sector. Commissioner, this sector is not asking for protectionism, what it is asking for at this stage, given the history of disregard by those in charge of the Directorate-General for Trade, is that it is not sunk even further. In this regard, we particularly support the request in the report by Mr Cadec that negotiations on the fishing chapters are transferred from the remit of the Directorate-General for Trade to that of the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, as is the case with agriculture, as we are also dealing here with products that are particularly sensitive, tuna being the classic case. On the subject of tuna, we have a scandalous example in the waiving of the rules of origin without the conditions being taken into account in the agreements with Papua New Guinea and Fiji, which only serves to favour our main competitors: Thailand and the Philippines. Commissioner, are you aware that, in addition to strangling the EU sector, thanks to your policy, Papua New Guinea is entering a phase of very low-quality job creation and zero sustainable development? Are you aware of the reports by non-governmental organisations operating in the region of child labour, insanitary conditions and lack of hygiene in factories, the disastrous environmental impact on the Madang coast and illegal fishing? Is it your responsibility to prevent this? Carmen Fraga Estévez,

Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work and on how easy he made it for all of us to work with him and produce a good report. We should be pleased because for the first time we are going to adopt a report on fisheries under the ordinary legislative procedure, at first reading and with the agreement of all three institutions. Parliament’s amendments were essentially aimed at incorporating the new recommendations that arose at the meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in 2009, as the Commission’s proposal only included the 2008 recommendations. They were also aimed at clarifying and specifying some definitions and technical specifications in order to ensure that the obligations of all operators and each of the Member States involved in bluefin tuna fishing were crystal clear. The aim is that the origin of all bluefin tuna that comes to EU markets can be identified so that if this cannot be verified its sale can be banned. As the rapporteur acknowledges in his report, we have therefore arrived at the most comprehensive documentation programme in existence for any species. This means that we can send a message of confidence, while acknowledging that the international organisation that governs the management of bluefin tuna is very capable of reacting for itself in terms of monitoring its status and responding to networks for the illegal fishing of a species whose trade has reached a level of complexity that surpasses that of any other species. Despite the criticisms, without the knowledge and experience acquired by ICCAT it is more than doubtful that any other organisation would be able to take the same type of measures as swiftly and with the same knowledge of the facts. We therefore trust that the entry into force of this regulation will not only help the recovery of the species and the fight against illegal fishing of that species, but also that it will help to reintroduce a minimum level of rationality and objectivity among the public, and especially within some non-governmental organisations.

 Mr President, everything is at stake in this reform. If we are not courageous now, there will not be another opportunity to create a genuine fisheries policy and we will be partly responsible for its failure. The CFP has, for years, suffered increasingly justified criticism and it would be disheartening if, when we are being offered one last opportunity, this Parliament were to prove incapable of proposing alternatives to what we have criticised so many times, in particular, the obvious failure of the conservation and management system, as demonstrated by both the state of resources and the decline in the sector. I simply cannot understand any reluctance to clearly suggest alternatives, as discussed in this House in 1996, such as transferable quota systems or effort-based management, which have had such positive results and which could help to maintain the more industrial fleets at least. The report says that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution, but at the same time, it closes the door on the possibility that there might be other solutions. I do not understand the contradiction, nor do I understand why, if someone does not want to use an instrument, the solution must be to prohibit it for everyone. That is not protection of the weakest; it is fear on the part of some sectors that only see permanent subsidies as solutions. The CFP should also guarantee competitiveness in a globalised world of fisheries products. The market for these products will undoubtedly continue to grow but it seems that it will grow without us. The policies within the Union should be coherent and we must ensure that the trade policy and rules on origin, such as those that appeared in the new economic partnership agreements, do not destroy the competitiveness of Community fisheries without being anything other than mere gestures to third countries; otherwise, it is our fisheries sector that will suffer. Mr President, consensus is a good thing when it results in progress, but not when we remain motionless in the face of problems, and we have many problems to solve. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I would also like to talk about commercial fishing species, and I would like to make it very clear that regional fisheries organisations are already responsible for managing and conserving these species. In fact, one only has to skim through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to realise that it is perhaps designed for elephants and polar bears, but it is not, of course, designed for commercial fishing species. I am not against protecting bluefin tuna, as that would be absurd, if only because of its importance to the fleet. I do, however, think that the measures need to be decided by bodies that have the best specialists in both managing fisheries and scientific research, because there is a reason why the CITES has to take external advice when it receives proposals on these species. I therefore think that the proposal to include bluefin tuna in Appendix 1 of CITES is unnecessary and unjustified, because it already has the measures imposed by International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). It is unfair, because it would gratuitously damage a fleet that has just embarked on a huge drive to reduce fishing, and even counterproductive, because it could give rise to an uncontrollable black market in bluefin tuna. I understand the enormous pressure that public opinion in general and this House in particular – as we are seeing – is experiencing from environmental NGOs. My political group has therefore decided to support inclusion in Appendix II as a compromise between the proposal of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and those of us who think that fisheries management cannot be snatched away from regional fisheries organisations. Our proposal is indeed based on the scientific advice to CITES. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) has recommended that bluefin tuna only be included in Appendix II of CITES, which demonstrates that many people have not even read the FAO report. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE

 Madam President, while illegal fishing in the Indian Ocean may be occurring, the Community fleet can certainly not be described as illegal, as has been suggested here. The Community fleet fishes within the strictest bounds of legality, with licences issued under the European Community – Seychelles Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which regulates and manages tuna fishing in the area. Secondly, all Community vessels are equipped with a satellite monitoring system, through which they can be located in real time and at all times by the fishing and military authorities. Thirdly, the Community fleet has observers on board and complies with a strict regime of providing information on fishing activity through fishing logbooks, catch samples and a ban on transferring goods at high sea, among other measures. Lastly, the entire Community fleet has been duly entered in the IOTC regional fleet register. I personally would like both the Commission and the Council to acknowledge that the European fleet fishing in that area is doing so within the strictest bounds of legality. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.

Madam President, thank you very much to the rapporteur and to the Committee on Budgets for accepting all of the amendments from the Committee on Fisheries. What is particularly important for us is the amendment calling for greater flexibility in the funding granted to Regional Advisory Councils on fishing. As well as being scarce, the funding is so subject to interpretations and to the discretion of the Commission that the Councils are prevented from spending even the little that they have; this request was made to us unanimously by the seven existing councils. One amendment that we consider particularly opportune calls for a comprehensive strategy to combat piracy that genuinely considers the situation of fishing boats, which are particularly vulnerable to these acts in all the world's waters. With regard to research and the Seventh Framework Programme, as in previous years, we have demonstrated prudence and asked that, now that fisheries research no longer has its own heading in the budget, at least the percentage of investment should not decrease, as all decisions on fisheries management hinge on knowledge of the environment and of marine species, especially given that one of our new objectives is to apply an ecosystem-based approach to all legislation in the Common Fisheries Policy. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Seeber. I would like to express a series of basic ideas that I believe are important. Firstly, a market in water cannot exist without greater transparency and a very clear idea of, and an obligation for countries to determine, where the water originates. Transparent management must be in place, along with knowledge of the water in the aquifers and how it is distributed. This process has not been designed; it is not yet a political tool and needs to be developed, as does aquifer control using a digital system. I also believe it is necessary to control the issue of shale gas and its impact on aquifers. I find it utterly dangerous and perhaps careless, and I am aware of the Commissioner’s interest in monitoring the specific impact of shale gas on aquifers. I also believe that, when it comes to drought, we have too many diagnoses and very few solutions. Any directive should relate to the agricultural production system and include solutions. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, there is an issue that concerns me: the fact that water is not a renewable product for many. Water is sometimes renewable, but not always. Many aquifers are not renewable, but water returns to the ground. The problem is that it does not always return to the same place it comes out; for example, the water that evaporates from the Mediterranean forms the rain that falls over Austria or Prague, and that aspect needs to be taken into account. I think transboundary water agreements are very good, and I think that the Commission should place much greater emphasis on them. As the directive lays down, a river has to be managed in a uniform and unique way, but this approach needs to be strengthened a great deal, and international relationships with respect to transboundary waters need to be promoted. That is essential in my view, and we will see it with Turkey, which will never agree, but we must insist. However, I think the monitoring of aquifers is very poor. The technology exists to monitor aquifers. Most damage is done through illegal extraction of water from aquifers. I therefore think it is vital that this aspect is taken on board, and technology exists for that. I also believe that the relationship between agriculture and water should be reviewed, because it should not be the case that crops that consume a lot of water are treated in the same way as those that do not. If we put a price on water, which I support in agriculture, and which occurs in my country and region, it should be taken into account that corn and lettuce, for example, consume much more water. We are then exporting water to all the countries to which corn or lettuce are exported. That needs to be reflected in agricultural prices. It is an issue for consideration. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 Madam President, I think that Ms Gardini’s report is very good and a great effort has been made. However, I would have liked it to have looked not only at prevention, but also at what will happen next. One of the extremely serious problems in Haiti, for example, in Lorca during the recent earthquake, and in L’Aquila, is precisely that, while lives have been saved and life has returned to normal, there is a need to rebuild cities, cities that took years and thousands of years to be built. They have to be rebuilt all of a sudden. They have to be built, and there is a science and technology to help with this. It is not possible to build on just any ground after an earthquake. It is important to find out which ground is the most suitable. Where is the special European Union unit to coordinate all the knowledge within all the sections? We are told that the new cities must be energy efficient, that they have to be smart cities, but how does one make the transition from a destroyed city to a smart city? In this area, Europe has abandoned its people. It has not put in place any coordination measures, and there is a need, Commissioner, to coordinate the reconstruction work and ensure true flood prevention. There is a need to look at how to control the rivers. Other countries, such as Spain, have achieved this to a large degree. One cannot stop talking about a disaster the day after it has happened. This is why I am much more concerned about what happens next, and I believe that this is where Europe must start to act. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Matias for her report. I would especially like to say a number of things to Ms Geoghegan-Quinn: firstly, do not disregard small projects. Silicon Valley was built on small projects. Europe needs a great many of these so that small universities may be brought on board. Secondly, I believe that what Europe needs is human resources. Large projects should be tied to a scholarship programme so that more grant holders can go to large universities and institutes to receive training. I think both the Structural Funds and this system should pay less attention to buildings – Europe has a plentiful supply of buildings but is indeed lacking in human resources. I also believe, Commissioner, that you will find you have the full support of Parliament if Member States are also required, through the European Research Area (ERA), to simplify their procedures. Europe’s efforts at simplification should be met with transparent procedures on the part of the Member States, which will have to commit themselves, given that they will be receiving money. Commissioner, you will have Parliament’s full support if we aim to achieve simple, transparent Council procedures. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines,

 Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude for the work done in this report. However, I have to say that an agreement between the political groups has not been reached. This is a very significant report because it breaks the unity of environmental policy that has always existed in Europe. The break is a result of requests to which the Commission, of course, has rightfully replied. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is not totally united either. However, we have reached some basic agreements in which we understand, firstly, that the legal pillar cannot be changed as it puts the internal market in danger. The internal market is one of the most important values that we have achieved. It safeguards agriculture and our negotiations before the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Therefore, we want a report that, within the uncertainty it creates, is well-founded on an adequate legal construct. Secondly, we seek to strengthen the scientific nature of decisions. We have a large body, the European Food Safety Authority, which we cannot weaken by returning to taking decisions only from the criteria of national authorities. Therefore, we support the fact that decisions should be taken on a case by case basis, that they should not be subjective, and that we should also bear in mind we are now subject to grand populist policies and media pressure that can often make us lose sight of clear and objective scientific values. Finally, we want to say that is necessary to safeguard agriculture in Europe. It is necessary to strengthen Europe. I want to add something more: certain forms of nationalism are the greatest and most dangerous form of euroscepticism. I believe democracies based on national parliaments have been talked about here, and we must take into account that the joint European policy is also democracy and it has produced a major environmental policy. Therefore, the Group of the European People’s Party officially supports the report although there are groups, such as the Spanish delegation, that think differently. It is obviously going to support the Commission’s Dalli report but it is not going to support the Lepage report if our amendments are not adopted. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Mr President, thank you very much for your compassionate and supportive words. The Lorca tragedy is becoming clear. At the moment, we know that eight people have died, among them two pregnant women and a twelve year-old boy, more than 250 have been injured and 80% of houses are affected. That is to say, from now on and for the moment, many Lorca citizens will be homeless. A large portion of Lorca citizens have also lost their places of work and with them have gone their hopes, expectations and opportunities. Lorca is a city of 70 000 inhabitants, of whom 20% are immigrants that the city has received, taken in and been able to give a new life with new meaning. I know that together, the old and new residents of Lorca, with help from the institutions and from everybody, will be able to begin a new journey in their lives. I also have to say and call on the European Union not to leave anyone behind and to be able to help those affected, recognise their pain and stand by their side, opening their arms and offering opportunities. I would like to thank you all very much and to ask for a minute’s silence. (Applause) Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 Mr President, I must thank all my fellow Members who have understood the problem of the Mediterranean region, the Spanish delegation, and all those who understand that we in the Canary Islands, Murcia, Valencia and Almeria, in addition to being frustrated at the Commission’s failure to honour its agreements, and to having seen many companies forced out of business, remain the entry point for immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, the entry point for Moroccan immigrants, and a buffer against the crisis. This is because we are currently supporting, at a time of utter economic penury, people who come to work and are able to send money home to their families. Therefore, I believe that the Commission must also behave responsibly with regard to the competences granted to it by the Treaties. I believe the Commission has not given any thought to the need to defend the interests of the public, or to the need to prevent an indiscriminate policy which, moreover, makes us import produce grown in extremely dubious phytosanitary conditions.

Mr President, I would like to celebrate the fact that there is innovation, attention to innovation, and also partnership, but I would also like to say that we do not know what this thing is that we are talking about. We are talking about an initiative, but no one has told us about its content, its formula or its model. I would suggest that, first of all, if we want to be efficient, as some fellow Members in this House have said, we review the results of what has happened with the Institutes for European Training and Information (IETIs), the partnerships and the platforms. Now that we have had experience with the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, we need to evaluate these things objectively, with external evaluation, looking at the results. In the cases of some IETIs, for example, we have seen that they have ended up being dominated by large companies, and once again, small businesses have been left out. I would suggest that there be policies and formulas for innovation to see how we can help small businesses to get involved, perhaps sometimes through intermediary bodies that help them to pay for the projects or to carry them out. We cannot, however, carry on this way, leaving small businesses out. Secondly, we need to consider the need for innovation in administration, in other words, innovation in the management of innovation. This is because the market guides innovation, and administration is not used to following the market, which works much faster. We therefore need to do much more capacity building, innovate in capacity building and innovate in administration for research, in order to manage research and help businesses to get to work on this very difficult and complex undertaking for the future. Of course, we also need to incorporate the banking system in terms of the risks involved, which should not only be undertaken by the European people. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Mr President, I think that in the Year of Biodiversity, we have talked a great deal about the disaster that is happening, but very little about solutions. I think that society needs solutions and new ways of approaching the problem. Firstly, the division of Europe into bio-geographical areas should be translated into a specific policy because the problems in the different areas of Europe are not the same. We should therefore have a micro-policy on biodiversity, because biodiversity is a local issue. Secondly, it is terrible that we should be turning our back on all action regarding soil and the abandonment of agricultural soil when the trophic cycles of animals require a detailed study of each area. This has not been done. It is not well known that in many areas, by planting certain trees, there will be more birds and by planting certain plants, there will also be more insects. Experts acknowledge that the lack of insects is the great tragedy of the loss of biodiversity, especially with regard to birds. Nothing is being said about the problems with soil, insects and the organic richness of soil. It appears to be a crime to talk about soil in Europe. Finally, I would like to say that the landowners are essential. An amendment on stakeholders that I tabled in committee was rejected. However, if we have birds or animals, will the farmers who plant the plants that they come to eat not have something to say? Will the owner of their habitat not have something to say? Will farmers not have something to say? I think that this method of imposing ideological dictatorships needs to come to an end in Europe if we want to achieve better biodiversity.

Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the pupils of the European Schools, whose qualifications are not recognised by the Spanish Ministry for Education. They are nearly all children of Spanish officials, and are being discriminated against and treated unfairly. The equivalence table that is being used, which was recently consolidated by the Spanish Ministry, deducts half a point or one point from pupils who have studied at the European Schools. Moreover, these are boys and girls who speak languages. This means that when they try to apply for degrees that have a high cut-off mark, they remain outside the system. We believe that this is inherently unjust.
 Firstly, because Spain signed all the agreements and conventions and is not keeping to them. Secondly, because it is basic discrimination. A country cannot go on purporting to be European when really it is treating pupils from our European Schools unfairly and discriminating against them. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 I would like to welcome Mrs Espinosa; I am very pleased that she is here. I am most concerned by the change in attitude, and the fact that our analysis of Copenhagen may well lead to a change in attitude. Firstly, I think that one of our problems is a lack of humility and realism, as my colleagues have already said. Above all, however, I am concerned that, when we have been to other countries, we have found that they do not talk about climate change but rather global change. The context in which we will be moving in Mexico, and the context in which we have been moving, is that of a growing population, a food shortage, a need for more agriculture, and limited land and water resources; therefore, any decision we take on climate change must be considered within that context. Of course, we must also remember that many countries have a right to develop. We thus need to take a systemic view, something that is lacking in our analysis of climate change. Climate change cannot be resolved on the issue of emissions alone. A sectoral, quantitative vision does not lead anywhere. What is more, we have to attach greater importance to science. In particular, I ask the Commission that those teams who tampered with data be checked and have their funding withdrawn, if the European Union is indeed supporting them, because this will discredit us forever. How are we going to coordinate on this matter? That is another very important question. How is the European Union going to organise itself in order to reach an agreement? We should have already started working on that this morning. Finally, the issue that concerns me: adaptation is carried out in the territory concerned, and we have to begin that process, once again, with a new, strategic vision of the territory; this includes productivity, strategic reforestation, regions, areas and districts devoted to agro-energy and, of course, water and biodiversity. We are lacking that vision. On this point, I think we need to think about the option of Structural Funds for new strategic plans in all regions in order to be able to carry out this adaptation; and decision makers should be invited to begin that strategic revision of the territory because we do not have responsibility for that area and it will be very difficult to work on it from Europe. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, it concerns me that frequently a lack of coordination means that sustainability criteria are not applied to agriculture. I would like to ask two questions: firstly, at a time when we are experiencing desertification in southern Europe, which is seriously impacted by climate change, and given that land use is the most important thing, why is money being paid to pull up olive trees and vines? This means that Europe is paying to have more desert! Are you going to stop this? Secondly, the agreement with Morocco: if Europe is conducting a common foreign policy, it must defend the interests of its citizens and of European production. Europe is negotiating the agreement with Morocco on its knees, without taking into account the principle of reciprocity, without guaranteeing health and that insecticide and food quality programmes will be maintained. How is it possible that this process is not only opening the door to products on top of the quotas, but that it is also putting quality at risk? Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I am going to talk about two concepts, namely coordination and flexibility. A problem has been found with all the matters that were discussed in the Council. In recent years, there has been an extraordinary lack of coordination between the different Directorates-General in the Commission. Climate change policy has frequently been considered independently of the scientific knowledge of the Directorate-General for Research. It has also been conducted independently of land use, for example, which is linked to climate change. My first question is as follows. Are you prepared to organise and strengthen internal coordination, in such a way that, when we appoint our commissioners, we can be assured that internal coordination is guaranteed? My second question relates to the fact that we are talking about competitiveness, about an economic crisis. Is the Commission also prepared to be more flexible on some matters such as REACH and its implementation, which is going to cause extraordinary damage to our own competitiveness? Is it prepared to be more flexible? My last idea on this coherence policy is that we cannot talk about the economy and recovery without talking about opening up the energy markets. There are countries that do not have an energy market, such as Spain in the case of gas. This means that prices rise and development becomes impossible. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

Mr President, the rapporteur, Ms García Pérez, should be congratulated on her work and on the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council of Ministers. It is shame that the Council is not represented here tonight with us. The new quality system for agricultural products is a simplification of the current system and a streamlining of current authorisation procedures, and that is good news. It is also a good achievement to have included the obligation to use the Union logo for designations of origin and protected geographical indications, given that it increases the exposure of European products. I think it is also worth noting that the provisions for protecting quality designations in bilateral agreements with third countries are strengthened, and that a legal basis for defending the European Union logo in those third countries is created, as I honestly think that the protection of European products in third countries should be a fundamental objective. It is a shame that this package has been somewhat stripped back during the negotiations and, I will say it again, it is a shame that the Council is not here to hear it, because the original quality package proposed by the Commission has been rather forgotten and the marketing standards and management of supply through quality designations of origin have been cut from the agreement, leaving it, as I said, a little empty. I think the Council’s blinkered attitude on these two issues is regrettable, as they refused to listen to Parliament’s reasonable positions. Supply management by means of designations of origin should have been defended, and will of course be defended in the single common market organisation. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, through the assistance of the European Union, food banks have been carrying out notable and recognised social work, which must continue in the future with the full support of Parliament. Solidarity and social and territorial cohesion is precisely one of the fundamental ideas behind European integration. The existence of a programme such as this is therefore vital in order to help achieve this. The current economic crisis is hitting European citizens hard. Eighty million people are below the poverty line and 43 million people have to weigh up whether to include protein in their diet twice a week. We can use the European Union budget to make a cohesive effort, which includes the common agricultural policy item. Ladies and gentlemen, as Members of this Parliament, we must encourage any initiatives to continue the food aid programme in 2014, and throughout the coming financial perspective period. The European Parliament has to forge an agreement with the Council and avoid selfishness at all costs in favour of European citizens. Esther Herranz García  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, apart from the 80 million poor people we are talking about, a further 43 million people find it hard to manage to eat animal protein twice a week. This situation could become worse because these people  – the ones who have problems managing to eat animal protein twice a week – could find themselves in dire straits, as the economic crisis is becoming even more acute. This is not exactly the best time for the European Union to be cutting the food aid budget in the run-up to the next multi-annual financial framework period. The agreement, endorsed by Parliament, extends food aid under the conditions requested by this Chamber. It also represents, however, a certain level of resignation towards the block that some Member States have kept up for several months in the Council. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to urge all of you here to take whatever initiatives are necessary to keep food aid going beyond 2014. Parliament should not stand idly by in the face of such an important humanitarian issue. We should not accept the status quo, and this means we should use the negotiations for the next multi-annual financial framework period to express our opinion on this issue, and to push for an agreement between the Council of Ministers and Parliament to ensure that aid for the poorest can be maintained beyond that date. Food banks have been able to provide a noteworthy social service thanks to European aid, and this should not be paralysed through the selfishness of some governments. This service has benefited 13 million people, which has enabled us, with minimal effort, to make the common agricultural policy a bit more important. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, last year Parliament’s Committee on Petitions asked the European Commission to amend the entry price system for fruit and vegetables entering the Union. This system allows products from third countries to enter fraudulently, as the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) itself has stated. These products are primarily Moroccan tomatoes. The Governments of Spain, France and Italy issued a statement last year that made the same request. We can combat this fraud by amending the Regulation on application of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for agricultural products, because the problem will not be resolved by aligning the Customs Code, Commissioner. For several years I have been speaking up within the Spanish Partido Popular
 about the need to stop new concessions to Morocco until such time as the European Union has the necessary instruments in place to ensure compliance with the agreement currently in force. The European Commission argues that the Member States should control imports. However, what the Commission does not say is that the current entry price system prevents national customs authorities from being able to properly trace the prices declared by importers in order to check for irregularities. Amend the Regulation on the application of the CMO for agricultural products and part of the problem will be solved. If you do not, the legal loophole in European legislation will prevent national authorities from doing their jobs properly. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to thank my colleague, Ms Patrão Neves, because, during the last few months, she has defended against all opposition this resolution which we are debating today and which we will vote on later. Ms Patrão Neves, with the support of the Group of the European People’s Party, has had to face many obstacles and I should like to congratulate her on the work which has brought us to this point. Ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, farmers received 50% of the final price paid by consumers; but today, in many cases, they receive less than 10%. At the same time, in 20 years, the market share for distribution chains has risen from 21.7% to 70%. Something is going on, and it is quite obvious. Measures must be adopted to ensure that food supply chains are more equitable, more equal and fairer. Firstly, the security networks provided by the common agricultural policy to ensure fair prices must be improved. We need an EU framework to guarantee fair relationships and avoid abuse. We must define and prohibit abusive practices within these margins. We must make production more concentrated, encouraging producers’, farmers’ and livestock breeders’ organisations. We must also ensure fair competition conditions for all producers with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities. I am referring to those producers outside of the European Union who do not meet the same standards in terms of quality, food security, animal welfare and all these issues which are so essential that we require our producers to meet such standards. Where do we do all of this? Well, in the next CAP reform, of course. We must improve contractual relations in this CAP reform. The aim will be to improve the position of the primary sector within the chain, improve distribution trade policy, avoid the constant increase in food speculation, take into account and improve those margins which are causing a rise in non-agricultural costs, and, finally, assure producers that all products on the EU market meet the same quality standards.

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, I am glad that you are here with us this morning, and I hope that today you will answer me a little more seriously and a little more clearly. In the proposed reform of the common agricultural policy that you presented to us on 12 October, you spoke of eliminating the sugar quota system, and you also spoke about ending vine-planting rights. Parliament, which has recently voted on the report by Mr Dess, is in favour of continuing planting rights beyond 2015 and not liberalising them. It also wants to maintain the sugar quota system until at least 2020. Are you going to support Parliament’s position and Parliament’s decision on these two issues? Esther Herranz García  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 If I have understood you correctly, Commissioner, given that there are now 15 Member States in the Council that think differently, as they did before, and given that Parliament is continuing its commitment to vine-planting rights, does this mean we can be relatively optimistic about the Commission’s proposal next year in the wine report? Esther Herranz García  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, this morning the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, brought this subject up in the debate on the state of the Union. That gives us an idea of the importance the Commission affords this issue. He spoke about hope, inclusion and solidarity. At a time of economic crisis such as this, when there are ever more unemployed people, and ever more people living close to the poverty line, this deadlock shown by some Member States is the most absolute example of a lack of solidarity. Those countries that are opposed, the richest of the European Union, may endanger the continuation of a programme that, with 1% of the common agricultural policy budget, helps 18 million people. The Commissioner is right to shame those Council members who are incapable of showing solidarity at this time. I urge the Polish Presidency, between now and the end of its term, to continue with its support in order to move forward with this programme. It deserves that. So do all the people who need it, and the EU also deserves that vote of confidence and, above all, that response to its citizens. The EU Council of Ministers should take into account Parliament’s view that the programme should not only be maintained but also improved, as this House called for yesterday. I would also like to remind the Heads of State or Government that we hope and trust that at the next summit they will take these matters seriously and find a political way out of this deadlock. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, though today’s debate focuses on this important report on the reform of the common agricultural policy, I should like to comment on a side issue that affects us and could affect the viability of the postulates we are defending in Parliament in connection with the reform of the future of the CAP. Next week, the European Commission will present its proposal on the financial prospects for the post-2014 period, in which, if my information proves correct, the Community executive is decidedly intent on proposing cuts to the EU agricultural budget. It must therefore be borne in mind that the European Commission will not take on board the opinion that we will adopt tomorrow, in which we specifically request the expenditure of the common agricultural policy to be maintained. I fail to see how, with a reduced budget, we will be able to rise to all the challenges described in that document; how common agricultural policy subsidies will be made greener, a process we want to ensure will not require an additional effort on the part of agricultural and livestock farmers; how we will be able to achieve this. I fail to see how, with a diminished CAP, we will be able to respond – just to give another example – to price volatility, and establish a budget line, as is our intention, that will rise to the crisis we have come to know so well. The CAP should not be measured merely in terms of expenditure because, in addition to the goods and services it provides, I believe it should be made clear – today of all days – that EUR 1 invested in agriculture generates EUR 10 of wealth in the agri-food sector. This should be very much taken into account when it comes to setting the next budgetary framework. Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that negotiations with third countries and with the World Trade Organisation pose a serious threat to the future of agricultural and livestock production in the European Union.

 Mr President, one can only express a deep sense of sorrow for the 23 fatalities: 22 in Germany and one in Sweden. This crisis is clear evidence that the European Union has a long way to go in improving its food safety alert system and its internal coordination. The Member States involved have been slow, inefficient and inoperative in their reaction, and, at this point in time, with 23 people dead, we still do not know where the problem is coming from. The European Commission must think hard about the problems it causes with its irresponsible actions or its failure to act at times of crisis such as we are seeing now. These lead to cases of financial ruin, the destruction of previously stable jobs, unemployment, helplessness and, needless to say, an extremely hazardous public health crisis. While you in the Commission paid heed to irresponsible statements issued by regional authorities in Germany – statements that were totally misinformed and quite irresponsible – mentioning Spanish farms by their names and addresses, the population remained exposed, without knowing it, to the bacterium. Thus, in the belief that they were avoiding contact with it, the public were more exposed than ever to eating potentially harmful food. In the Council of Agriculture Ministers that will be held in Luxembourg at two o’clock this afternoon, the European Commission should propose that a portion of the EUR 2 500 million left over from the common agricultural policy be put to use. Those EUR 2 500 million should be used to redress, in so far as is possible, the damage that has been caused. To enable this, a suitable legal solution will need to be found, as was the case in previous instances, for example, the ‘mad cow’ and dioxin affairs. One such solution should also be found now. Commissioners, Ministers, your actions in Luxembourg today must befit the stature of your office. Furthermore, the German authorities, in view of their reckless accusations, should definitely support this financial solution from the very beginning, and use funds of their own to conduct communication campaigns aimed at restoring consumer confidence in horticultural products, which is now in shatters.

on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I would firstly like to express my gratitude to the Committee on Petitions for its hard work following the complaint brought by the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants, based on the report published by OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, in 2007. I believe this report’s conclusions are extremely clear and justify only too well action on the part of the European Commission – which should have addressed this matter a long time ago – to clarify the operation of the entry price regime, at least in relation to the tomato sector. However, not only having failed to take any action to prevent the different types of fraud made possible by the current Entry Price Regulation, the Commission has negotiated a new agriculture agreement with Morocco without having first resolved the shortcomings of the import regime currently in place. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the European Commission to take its responsibilities seriously, to start investigating where and how fraud is being committed, and, potentially, to demand payment of any unpaid customs duties. I believe that there is no way that a new agreement with Morocco should be ratified until all the details we have set out are resolved. Our aim is not to hinder new international agreements, but to ensure that such agreements will not seriously damage the interests of European producers, and that the rules laid down in those agreements will be adhered to. Where the new agreement with Morocco is concerned, all the European fruit and vegetables sector is demanding is a guarantee that the terms agreed will, in fact, be observed. This will only be made possible by reforming the entry price regime. We cannot have a new agreement with Morocco until we have a new system for entry prices. We will not be able to ratify the agreement that the Commission has already concluded. Moreover, if this supervisory role is to be played by the Member States, they should be required to make a significant financial contribution. However, it is also true that we have long been calling for a European borders and customs system similar to that of the United States, so as to ensure effective control. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

Mr President, in January 2012, 400 Spanish egg producers could disappear, which is around 30% of the total number in my country, with the loss of the production of 300 000 tonnes of eggs. The European Union could stop producing the 80 million eggs, which amount to 2 million tonnes, and if we do not act very intelligently, the only thing that we would achieve would be that they would be covered by imports from third countries, whose animal welfare standards are much lower than those in the European Union. This 1999 directive, which requires that the space in cages for laying hens be increased, demands that we act intelligently and positively, because otherwise, we will only weaken European production and give extra trade opportunities to third countries where the amount of space per bird is much smaller than what we currently have in the European Union. This directive requires a great deal of effort from European producers, as in Spain alone, it is understood that the cost is around EUR 600 million. It should also not be forgotten that it has an economic impact that extends to the egg products industry and the food industry in general. I therefore ask for your support for the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to paragraph 2, which asks for a solution to be found at least for responsible farms and responsible businesses that are in the process of transforming their farms and will have completed that transformation by January 2012. We need to support them in transforming their facilities and give them time to complete that process, thus preventing farms from suffering irreparable damage and preventing an overnight shortage in the EU market, which will consequently increase prices for consumers. We need to respect the directive, give the egg and egg products industries a chance and also respect the right to animal welfare and the right of consumers to a reasonable price.

Commissioner, thank you very much for being here and for having shown so much sensitivity regarding this very important parliamentary initiative that is so necessary for the European livestock sector. The sector is particularly vulnerable to the crises affecting EU agriculture as a whole, due to multiple factors: the high costs of inputs, the fall in market prices, imbalances of power in the food chain and the current increase in cereal prices. The European livestock industry has to deal with these problems just like other agricultural sectors, but with an aggravating factor: the large investments that are particular to this type of production. As the European Commission is on the verge of presenting its communication on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), I think this is a very good time to send a message of solidarity and concern to this group of producers. In my country, Spain, as in other EU countries, we are talking about a structural crisis, and the cereal price rises have just aggravated a situation that has been dragging on for several years now. The statistics show that a growing number of farms are being abandoned. However, this should not be the case in the context of global demand that will grow in the next few years thanks to the supposed improvement in people’s standard of living. With a view to the forthcoming CAP reform, what measures is the Commissioner, or the European Commission, planning, taking into account the specific nature of the livestock sector? I am talking about market measures, and other initiatives to prevent the models of intensive production that respect EU environmental standards being penalised by the future aid system, among other detrimental effects. Common-sense measures should be implemented that guarantee greater security of supply of livestock feed, the establishment of sufficient cereal reserves and the speeding up of the release of those reserves. Finally, to conclude, I would like to welcome the fact that this motion for a resolution makes special mention of pork and poultry, sectors that do not receive direct EU aid, but for which market and trade measures could also be established to alleviate their situation.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Cioloş that this report is essential and comes at the right time because it has demonstrated the abuses committed by mass distribution, severely disrupting the various links in the food chain. While the Bové report may go too far on some points by seeking to be too interventionist, it must be acknowledged that from the point of view of the social market economy that we advocate in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), it provides responses to the justified complaints made by European producers. It also brings transparency to the different parts of the food chain, which is always a good thing, offers the weakest sectors in the chain much more opportunities to defend themselves and, of course, supports European consumers in becoming more informed about that food chain. The European food industry could perhaps have been taken into account to a greater extent in this report, which would have been a good thing, but the report does also include measures for curbing the volatility of prices, which was very necessary. It also sets out measures for achieving equality between the links in the chain, as requested by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and it also asks for abusive and unfair practices in mass distribution to be combated. The time is now coming to establish a list of abusive practices to be strictly banned by European legislation. It is also important that measures be set out for preventing difficult practices through private labels that go against competition and intellectual property law. For all these reasons, we should support the Bové report, and all our fellow Members in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, who have worked hard to ensure that this report was finally published to help European producers move forwards.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the next few months we will be entering into a full debate on the new common agricultural policy (CAP). It is important to reach a satisfactory agreement, and so I hope that the Belgian Presidency manages to achieve what the Spanish Presidency did not. I hope that the Belgian Presidency can direct discussions in such a way that the Member States commit themselves to maintaining a truly strong CAP in the future, with a sufficient budget for meeting the needs of the 27 Member States, both new and old; I also hope that it will not be as it was in 2005, when there was a lack of money and a modulation had to be improvised. In the upcoming reform of the CAP, we are gambling with the viability of a sector that not only provides intangible goods and services, such as care for the environment, but must also guarantee the supply of food to the European public. We have witnessed distressing shortage situations in the past, which is why the European Parliament should make security of supply based on EU production the main objective of the next reform, without leaving aside other contributions, such as the fight against climate change. Esther Herranz García,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Madam President, to be honest, the first thing I wanted to do this evening is to thank Mr Scottà for his excellent skill in negotiating this report. It has been a real pleasure working with him and with the other spokespeople for the parliamentary groups. We are proud of the position that will be demonstrated tomorrow in the vote in Parliament and on a report such as this, which defends quality and which commits to the development and enhancement of rural areas, not only as mere evidence of a traditional European culture, but as true wealth- and job-creation agents. These are jobs that we currently need so much at this time of economic crisis and such a dramatic situation in terms of levels of employment in some Member States. In addition, we are pleased with the protection maintained by Parliament and the position already maintained by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as it has made clear, in committing to quality of the highest standard. With regard to that highest standard, moreover, we naturally commit to maintaining that differentiation between Protected Designation of Origin and Protected Geographical Indication. Of course, we reject ideas of levelling quality downwards and we want EU production to receive attention and be valued. I am delighted at what Mr Cioloş had to say. It was, of course, pleasing to hear him speak about commitment to the future of the European farming environment. We naturally hope he will listen to Parliament’s voice, which will be reflected tomorrow in the vote. Finally, I would like to say let us hope that it never happens again that the European Commission gets ahead of Parliament by prohibiting things such as, for example, marketing standards for fruit and vegetables, that have caused such damage to European free competition. We want the imbalances in the market corrected and we also want to commit to quality, variety, food safety and the right quantity of production. In addition, we want EU production and the quality of that EU agricultural and food production to be defended in the World Trade Organisation. We are, of course, also relying on the work of Mr Cioloş for that, because neither our European producers nor our European consumers can go on being defenceless. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs McGuinness on this initiative, which demonstrates the important role that the common agricultural policy (CAP) plays in meeting food provision needs internationally. Now that the European Commission seems to want to reduce the burden of the CAP on the Community budget, it is important to stress that while the CAP may not be a priority, food sufficiency must be. In past decades, it has been clear that without the CAP, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve food sufficiency. Agriculture cannot, therefore, be compared with other sectors of the economy which are able to thrive in a free market, because the food market is not a free market. Farmers need the support of the European Union in order for their businesses to succeed, and the European Union, in turn, needs farmers in order to maintain an agricultural model that is capable of providing sufficient food of sufficient quality to its increasingly demanding citizens. I therefore believe that we must change the course of the CAP, but not abolish it. In order to do this, direct aid must be guaranteed to farmers and a policy of managing agricultural markets must be restored to bring about greater price stability, which would benefit not only farmers but also consumers and third countries. A framework of best practices should be established in order to encourage balanced relations between the different players in the food chain, avoiding abusive practices and promoting fairer distribution of commercial margins. In addition, a European consumer information policy that highlights efforts by Community producers to comply with European Union regulations in the areas of the environment, food security and animal welfare is needed, since Community producers have to compete with imports from third countries, where the standards applied are much lower. Third-country producers prefer to export to the European Union rather than supplying their own countries’ markets because such exports are more profitable under World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements. Esther Herranz García,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (ES)
 Madam President, the European Union imposes on Community producers the highest standards in the world in terms of food security, health, animal welfare and the environment. European stockbreeders are obliged to meet these standards as a prerequisite for receiving European Union support. For the vast majority, this support does not offset the increased burden, and farms are being abandoned at an alarming rate. This process will continue unless adequate measures are taken. Let us, however, examine the issue more closely. The growing deficit in European production is naturally being covered by imports from third countries, mainly from Brazil. Given the pressure on Community stockbreeders, it would be totally dishonest to allow consignments of meat to enter the Community market if they failed to meet the minimum requirements agreed by the European Union with third countries. I would also like to highlight the fact that these requirements are lower that those imposed on our own farmers, because it would seem that imposing exactly the same standards on third-country imports would go against World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Given that the WTO prevents us from imposing the same standards on imports as we do on European stockbreeders, however, the Commission must, at the very least, guarantee that all meat that crosses Community borders comes from farms that have undergone adequate inspections. It would make no sense to block imports from countries like Brazil, since there is a Community demand which must be met. Nonetheless, this does not justify closing our eyes and looking the other way in the face of any irregularities that the European Union’s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) might detect during its regular inspections. I would like to know why the Commission is so keen to downplay these irregularities given that the FVO, on its last mission to Brazil, confirmed that some certification authorities do not meet the necessary inspection standards. The FVO also found huge flaws in the traceability system used by Brazil and detected problems with many consignments in transit to the European Union that did not have the necessary certificates. In view of this information, how can it be guaranteed that the 1 500 Brazilian farms do fulfil the agreed requirements? Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, you ended your speech by saying that there is a crisis in the milk sector, and yet you started by saying that all possible measures have already been taken and that the situation is being sorted out. You should know that it takes a wise woman to recognise that she was wrong. That is a saying in Spain, which could very well be applied to this situation. For months the milk sector has been suffering one of the worst crises in its history. Despite that, because the European Commission and certain governments – seemingly including my own, the Spanish Government – do not want to allow their arms to be twisted, they are refusing to go back on the decisions relating to the health check of the common agricultural policy. Those decisions were taken without any thought for the fragility of this sector, and in a market context very different from the one that has developed since that compromise was agreed. It makes you think that the Member States did not want to see, or could not see, at that time, the storm that was approaching. The reform has very quickly become irrelevant, due to the major turnaround in the market, which demonstrates that the sector is totally at the mercy of price volatility. The fact that major producers such as France and Germany – countries which, in absolute terms, obtained the biggest increase in their national production quotas in this agreement – are now the ones asking for a review of the health check decisions raises a lot of issues. As I see it, the Member States were wrong and should have listened more carefully to the voices, including mine, which were calling for any final decision on the future of the sector to be postponed until 2011. It is a shame that no one listened to us. Perhaps you should do so now. Eva Ortiz Vilella  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the President of the Court of Auditors for his presentation and the Commissioner for his statement.  The figures show that a number of issues need to be examined and we all – Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control, the President of the Court of Auditors and the Commission – need to attend very carefully to our own areas of responsibility, to ensure that we always achieve the best possible results.  Furthermore, the Member States have a very important role to play and must take on a task that, in my opinion, is vital if we are to succeed in ensuring that the results achieved and the image we convey when allocating funds are as good as they can possibly be. It is all the more important that money is spent soundly since that is why we are all here. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, in the last decade, one of the Union’s greatest successes has undoubtedly been the enlargement process. There is a series of principles that must govern, or must continue to govern, that process. I am referring to consolidation, conditionality and communication with the citizens. Another important prerequisite is the EU’s integration capacity. Does this principle still apply, as Ms Koppa’s report rightly suggests? Will we have resources in the future to finance the common policies or cohesion? I ask this because far-reaching cuts are being proposed for the new financial perspective, precisely in the funds for those policies, and others, too. Is that the European Union that we want in the future? Is that the way to prepare for future enlargements? Paradoxically, sometimes the greatest defenders of enlargement are those who most want to reduce the EU budget. We are also seeing the difficulty of having 27 Member States when taking decisions to tackle the serious crisis and strengthen the economic and monetary union. Sometimes, it takes a great deal of time to apply political decisions and that does not set a good example for future enlargements. It is possible that some of our own citizens cannot understand either how the European Union, with so many difficulties, will be able to cope with new enlargement challenges. I would add a small point: I am very pleased that the Koppa report incorporates the idea of creating a specific curricular element on the Union in secondary schools. It is the best way for young generations to find out about the Union and learn more about the enlargement process. My last point is that I cannot support the removal of the footnote from paragraph 28; it is the same formulation as that used by the Council and the Commission. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, given that foreign and security policy is such a broad subject, I shall focus on three basic ideas. Firstly, the EU’s external action should be ambitious. I want the European Union to be a major player in a global, complex, increasingly multipolar world, and it is also possible that we shall soon see something of a withdrawal in the external action of the United States. Secondly, size counts in foreign policy; as Europeans, we are stronger together than apart, and this ambitious perspective for Europe is reflected in Mr Brok’s solid report, which we shall adopt tomorrow. Thirdly, the Treaty of Lisbon provided new tools for this policy. I am referring to the position you hold, Baroness Ashton, as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Vice-President of the Commission. As you also chair the Foreign Affairs Council, it will now be easier to achieve unity, continuity and consistency in the Union’s foreign policy. In addition, you have a new instrument, the European External Action Service, into which diplomats from Member States have been incorporated, who will use their experience in foreign policy to enrich a vision that is more focused on issues related to economics, trade and cooperation by officials from the Commission. Finally, a true EU foreign policy not only takes time but also needs two basic conditions to be met: the new bodies of the Treaty of Lisbon should be ambitious, working with the purpose of leading the 27 Member States, not just accompanying them or finding lowest common denominators; secondly, the Member States should be aware of the need to work together on foreign policy, acting in a spirit of compromise and taking a constructive approach.

Mr President, I welcome the fact that the recent presidential elections in Egypt took place without any major problems and that the results have been accepted, but I think it is clear that those elections and the unexpected decisions taken by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces a few days before demonstrate that, in reality, there is a dual power structure in Egypt. These are delicate times. I believe it is essential that these two centres of power have dialogue and cooperate during this phase and launch an ordered transition towards normal democracy. I welcome the fact that it appears that the government soon to be elected by President Morsi will be a broad government representing broad sectors of the plural society that Egypt has. It will also be important to draw up a new constitution. I trust that it will establish a multi-party democratic system that respects human rights, including the rights of minorities. We cannot forget, as other speakers have said, the importance of the Christian minority, whose rights must be fully respected without discrimination. Egypt, ladies and gentlemen, is a key country in the Arab world and the whole region. What happens there will have repercussions on the rest of the Muslim world. Egypt can set an example, as Mr Pöttering said. It is also very important for the Egyptian political leaders to be aware of the need for their decisions not to destabilise the region, which has suffered numerous conflicts. I welcome the fact that the current international commitments are going to be honoured. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union cannot be removed from what is happening in Egypt. I repeat, it is a very important country, in our Mediterranean neighbourhood. We must support this transition and try to help where we can, without, of course, failing to defend our values and interests. Finally, I would like to express my support for the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which has been suffering a difficult situation in Egypt for months. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, this is a time of significant change in the Middle East. I will briefly discuss three points: Changes are afoot in Egypt with the forthcoming presidential elections. I would like them to be clean, to take place without incident, and for the parties and society to accept the results. I would certainly have liked the Egyptian authorities to have invited European observers. Egypt is a key country in the Arab world. It is important for a multi-party system to be consolidated there in which the prosperity and freedoms of the Egyptian people are the main objective. Living together in tolerance, rather than radicalism or polarisation, will allow all Egyptians to exercise freedoms, including religious freedom. What are your hopes, Baroness Ashton, for these elections? In Israel, I would like the broader base of the new government to favour the opening of negotiations with the Palestinians, but I am sceptical about the launching of negotiations this year due to the continuing problem of the settlements, which you referred to along with the regional and international context, including the electoral outlook in the United States. Another reason I am sceptical is the way that Israel is focusing on the Iranian nuclear programme. However, I do not think that the deadlock is helping anyone. I do not think that the changes that have taken place in the region are going to provide Israel with a more favourable context in future for resuming the negotiations. I will end by discussing Syria. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, things are not improving there, as has already been stated. Kofi Annan’s plan is not succeeding. The violence is only increasing, and is even seriously affecting children, and Kofi Annan’s plan is not supporting the opposition. I am afraid that President al-Assad’s government thinks that it can crush the revolution by force, and that in the end, the international community will accept it. It is essential that Russia and China place more pressure on the Syrian authorities to change their attitude. I would like you to tell us, Baroness Ashton, whether, at the recent summit with Russia at the weekend, you were able to glean whether there is any desire in Moscow to adjust its position. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, the consolidation of democracy, human rights and the rule of law is particularly important in our neighbourhood – taken from Article 8 of the Treaty on European Union – and Ukraine is a neighbouring country to Europe, with which we have concluded negotiations on an association agreement, and one which has what we call ‘European prospects’. For that reason, therefore, there needs to be a strong demand for human rights. I am worried about the lack of political will from the Ukrainian authorities on this matter. This is emphasised with the case of Ms Yulia Tymoshenko and also other opposition leaders, victims of selective justice and a penal code from the Soviet era, as previously mentioned. It appears that their ambiguity means that there is almost no difference between political and penal responsibility. A democratic system cannot function in this manner. Fundamental rights need to be protected, and opposition politics logically have to be respected. In addition, I think it would be very convenient if the European Union could reach a unanimous view on the level and manner in which high-ranking politicians are going to attend the European Football Championships that are to be played in Ukraine next month. And, lastly, ladies and gentlemen, I was somewhat surprised to read that the President of this House entertained the Prime Minister of Ukraine last week. Given that neither the Council nor the Commission went to such lengths, I wonder whether our coordination within the institutions of the Union is appropriate, and I would like Mr Füle, the Commissioner, to tell me if this coordination exists.

 Madam President, first of all, Baroness Ashton, I would like to thank you for what you said about the arbitrary and unlawful expropriation that the Repsol company in Argentina is undergoing. This measure goes against international law and the principle of legal certainty that affects all Europeans. I welcome your response and, once again, I thank you for your words, Baroness Ashton. I would now like to talk about the Howitt report. Articles 3 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union show very clearly that human rights are an extremely important part of the EU’s external relations. That is because the rule of law and human rights are a constituent part, so to speak, of this Union and its Member States, but also because in today’s world, the international community as a whole considers that human rights are universal and indivisible, and that defending them can no longer be hindered by the old principle of non-interference in Member States’ internal affairs. The report we shall vote on tomorrow shows how important human rights are for Parliament; this can be clearly seen, I believe, from the Sakharov Prize that we created in this House many years ago, and also from the support we are giving to the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. Ladies and gentlemen, respect for human rights is a highly topical issue. This can be seen from the brand new role being created, which will be responsible for protecting human rights, and from the changes and revolutions that broke out last year in the Arab world – one of the main goals of which was to recover human dignity and respect for human rights. Baroness Ashton, we must all do our utmost – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – so that those political processes can consolidate the noble aspirations for which they were initiated, and so that the expectation of freedom, pluralism, tolerance and respect for minorities is not jeopardised.

 On behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we want to declare that our vote on the resolution on the European integration process of Kosovo is based on the fact that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it was a normal independent state, recognised by the international community, and does not take into account that the status of this territory continues to be controversial. It has yet to be recognised by a majority of countries, five of which are Member States of the European Union, including Spain. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to focus on three points regarding Turkey’s accession to the European Union. The first of these is its visa policy for third country nationals. Speaking two years ago in Parliament, I expressed my surprise that Turkey did not bring this policy into line with that of the European Union. According to the European Commission’s 2011 Progress Report, Turkey has recently signed visa waiver agreements with Sudan and Yemen. I have also been informed that Iranian, Libyan, Lebanese and Syrian nationals do not require visas either. Last week, a very widely read Spanish newspaper claimed that Turkey’s visa exemption for some countries, together with its land border, which runs for thousands of kilometres, make the country a corridor of choice for organised crime. In my opinion, Turkey should make a serious effort and progressively bring itself into line with the Union’s visa policy. It is part of the acquis. It should align itself with Europe rather than continuing on its current line, which takes it in the opposite direction, distancing it from European Union policy. It should progressively align itself, and I believe that the Commission should carefully monitor this matter. Secondly, I think political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey should be closer. Turkey has recently become close to the Arab world. It occupies a very significant position in a region that is very close and very important to Europe, and which is undergoing major changes. Dialogue and cooperation between Brussels and Ankara would be very positive. Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the range of reforms that Turkey has introduced, and I hope it pursues them with determination and strength, as the report that we will approve tomorrow calls on it to do.

 Mr President, talking of enlargement encourages optimism. No Member State wishes to leave the Union; on the contrary, there are a number of states who wish to join, Iceland among them. I welcome its desire for integration and the rapid pace of adhesion negotiations. I say adhesion because that is what it is, adhering to and accepting the European Union acquis
. In the negotiations, efforts are continuing to define the adaptations that the candidate country needs to make to adopt the acquis
 and the timescale for this. In the Commission’s report of October 2011, we were told that as yet, there had been no changes to Icelandic legislation on fisheries, and that it is not in line with the EU acquis
, nor are the current restrictions on foreign investment in fisheries consistent with the acquis
: they infringe fundamental principles, like the right of establishment and the free movement of capital and services. Iceland is a major fishing nation, like my own country, Spain and my region, the Autonomous Community of Galicia. Iceland’s accession will strengthen the fisheries sector within the Union, but, Mr President, it cannot remain outside EU law in this sector. I am asking the Commission to pay the closest attention to this issue. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, Russia is very important to the European Union both as a neighbouring European country and as a global actor and permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. This is why we would like to have a closer relationship with Russia so that we can address issues of mutual interest and for reasons of global governance. However, there are obstacles to such a close relationship. We regret Russia’s behaviour during the Syrian crisis, and certain recent events, like December’s elections to the Duma, and the presidential elections on 4 March, have left us feeling disappointed and concerned. The elections did not conform to the democratic standards of a European country which is a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE. As I have said, it is in our interests to have a relationship of mutual trust with Russia, but the fundamental basis of this relationship should be shared democratic values, joint respect for human rights, the multi-party system and respect for the democratic opposition. The modern Russia we want to see is a Russia which shares European values. We can build the close relationship we want on the basis of these values. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Russia is an important neighbour for the EU, for both geographical and historical reasons, and it is also a very significant economic and energy partner. Furthermore, it is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Russia is one of the actors needed for efficient global governance capable of dealing with global problems, and we also need increased cooperation from Russia on issues such as the situation in Syria, which is on the brink of civil war, or the nuclear threat from Iran. I believe, however, that the EU wants a relationship with Russia that goes beyond those global or regional interests. Russia is a European neighbour, and a member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. I believe that we would like a relationship of real trust and friendship with Russia, based on shared values and principles. That is why we want a new association agreement and why we want for Russia what we also demand of ourselves: a pluralistic democratic regime that respects civil and political freedoms, and a rule of law in which corruption and arbitrariness are the exception. However, the organisation of the legislative elections in December did nothing to strengthen that trust. The irregularities of the election process are well known, as are the serious accusations made. I hope that the next presidential elections will not show the same shortcomings, and that Russia can finally start to move towards clear democratic progress and modernity, which is what its European partners wish for.

 Madam President, our ‘southern’ neighbourhood is going through a new phase in its history, from which there is no way back. The European Union must support these processes of democratic change, drastically altering its former complacency, which gave the impression of aiming for stability but was nothing more than inertia. As Article 8 of the Treaty of Lisbon states, our neighbourhood policy should be based on universal values such as human dignity, human rights, democracy and the rule of law, as well as having conditions and specific requirements, since not all processes are the same. There should be country-specific procedures in each case. In any event, we must embark upon dialogue with new political groups, including moderate Islamist forces, based on the values mentioned previously. We should strengthen our relations with these countries, their political and social forces and their civil societies. This is a job for the EU institutions and also for European political and social groups. Aside from the political support, we must provide economic and financial aid to these countries. Commercial opening should be gradual. It should be mutually beneficial and include the services sector, as called for by the report. We should also prioritise the administrative and institutional development of several of our neighbours to the south and help them in the fight against corruption and organised crime. I would also like to see the Union for the Mediterranean find sufficient resources to put some of the identified projects into action. These issues and many more, Madam President – and I am finishing now – are covered in the extensive report written by my brilliant colleague, Mário David, which we will be voting on tomorrow. I am sure, Mr Füle, that you and the Commission services will find it a very useful read. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, Europe and the United States are going through a severe economic crisis. Both our economies are very interconnected and during the next summit, we have to commit to act in a more coordinated manner and to implement the commitments that were made at the G20. In a globalised economy, the solutions should be global, but it is also necessary for everyone to fulfil their responsibilities in their own area. The United States should reduce its trade and fiscal deficits and China should revaluate its currency. We Europeans should finally solve the Greek crisis and the sovereign debt issues in several of our countries. Otherwise, we would not have any credibility as effective partners. The fleeting presence of President Obama in Europe to attend the G20 meeting in Cannes contrasts with the time he is dedicating to the Asia-Pacific region this week. It appears to symbolise the rise of Asia and the decline of Europe. It is not only economic challenges that we Europeans and Americans have to tackle, however, but also many others: climate change, nuclear proliferation, energy, terrorism, poverty; and regional issues such as the Arab Spring and the conflict in the Middle East. We should consult and coordinate and stop the concept of the ‘West’ or the ‘transatlantic community’ increasingly losing value to Asia’s benefit. Asia should also take part in global governance, but not by taking the role of Europe. For that we need a true Europe, a solid European Union, an efficient global player, and not a fragile set of countries that do not know how to resolve the sovereign debt crisis. This is what the United States expects and is also what our citizens want. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, religious freedom is recognised in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and also in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Egypt has been a State Party since 1982. Moreover, we know how important freedom of demonstration and expression is. The seriousness of what happened on 9 October 2011 in Cairo lies in the fact that disproportionate force was used against demonstrators who were part of a minority demanding protection for their religious freedom. There needs to be a rigorous investigation into what took place, and the guilty parties should be punished, as Mr Pöttering quite rightly said. Ms Ashton, religious freedom must be protected, and all countries must respect it, as this Parliament called for in its resolution of 20 January 2011. We want an Egypt of freedom, justice and peace; an Egypt that keeps its distance from events such as these. What is more, Egypt is a great country and a leader in the Arab world: what goes on there has major repercussions. Recent events cannot happen again. Egypt should be an example of tolerance and harmony, not one of violence and violated freedoms. The EU should do its utmost to see that freedoms are respected during the transitions taking place in the Arab world, which we wish to promote and accompany. In recent months, Christian leaders and representatives of civil society expressed their concern to me over the situation regarding religious freedom in their particular countries. Baroness Ashton, I would like you to keep us informed of the measures you intend to propose in order to strengthen the action taken by the EU in this area, as the Foreign Affairs Council asked you to do in February. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we debated the peace process here over six months ago. I stressed at that time that there was an urgent need to re-start talks because time was not in favour of either of the two parties. I can understand how the stalling of the process has prompted the Palestinians to take the initiative and to raise the issue of their admission to the United Nations. We are now in a very complex situation. I suppose that this matter will eventually be passed from the Security Council to the General Assembly. I would like the European Union and its Member States to play an active role and for the Twenty-Seven to be united in stating an opinion on the resolution that will eventually be put to the vote. There are no simple solutions: no simple yes and no simple no. The General Assembly’s resolution must be careful. It must not imperil the peace process or put either of the two sides, or the other players who are the main promoters of the process, into impossible situations. However, a failure to act must not be an option. Ladies and gentlemen, today, unfortunately, just like six months ago, I cannot be optimistic about the progress of the talks. The news we have received today about new settlements in Jerusalem is, frankly, very bad. In addition, I fear that some of the 2012 elections will not help lead to a solution. The situation could be better in 2013, but I would be sorry to have lost a year, particularly given the current dynamics of change in the Arab world. These are times of historic responsibility for the two sides, and also for the international community. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, Lady Ashton, I share your view that the EU must give its attention as a matter of priority to the southern Mediterranean, which is going through a period of extraordinary changes. I am delighted that the recent referendum in Morocco has adopted the reform promoted by King Mohammed VI. It would be good if changes at a constitutional level were accompanied by reforms in economic and social matters in order to reduce inequalities. Contrary to what is happening in Morocco, we are receiving bad news from Syria and, unfortunately, the end of the Gaddafi regime has not yet been brought about in Libya. We must remain involved in these processes, and also in Egypt and Tunisia. It is very important that we go along with the changes that are taking place in the region and we must ensure that the values of liberty, justice, democracy and respect for human rights, including freedom of conscience and religion and also gender equality, prevail. Positive conditionality or, what amounts to the same thing, the more for more strategy, should assist this as well as strengthen relations with civil society. Ladies and gentlemen, I am concluding. I hope, moreover, that the Union for the Mediterranean is finally able to act after a period of paralysis. Furthermore, as of yesterday, it has a new Secretary General, whom I wish success in the complex management of the Union. Let us hope that projects identified some three years ago can be set in motion and so contribute to improving the economy in the Mediterranean countries. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, I, too, of course, would like to add my support for the residents of Lorca. In this debate about education, I want to reiterate an important point: the need to include in secondary school studies a specific subject covering the history, aims and workings of the European Union. I have already talked about this issue in the last term, in plenary, after the failure of Constitutional Treaty referenda. Fortunately, last year in this House, the Løkkegaard report on journalism and new media, approved in September, supported the introduction of this subject in paragraph 13. I myself submitted an amendment in this regard. Recently in Spain, the Valencia regional government decided to include a subject for the next academic year. It is an initiative that other regions and countries should follow. I understand that the Commission, of course, supports and welcomes initiatives of this type. Ladies and gentlemen, we only value, we only appreciate … (The President cut off the speaker) Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to start with two initial observations. I prefer individual debates to a joint debate. We are dealing with separate issues, which deserve independent and in-depth discussion. Meanwhile, I would like to echo the words of Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra about the death of the Cuban dissident, Mr Soto. Please allow me to make three additional comments. Unfortunately, when all of us were hoping we could focus on the European Union’s external role these years, the serious economic and financial crisis has been taking up all our efforts. However, a great number of external challenges, particularly in our Mediterranean neighbourhood, mean we cannot afford to wait. The European Union must have a political and economic presence in the processes of change taking place in the Arab world. I am also celebrating, Baroness Ashton, the fact that the European Union’s voice in the United Nations General Assembly was finally strengthened in New York last week as the result of a vote that received widespread support. I congratulate you on that, given that last year’s disaster raised worrying questions about the future role of the Union in the world and in international organisations. However, the divergent European votes on Resolution 1973 of the United Nations Security Council highlight the enormous difficulties – I stress, enormous difficulties – involved in achieving an effective common security and defence policy. To summarise, Baroness Ashton, you and Mr Van Rompuy, who also has many responsibilities in foreign matters, have the huge task of convincing the Member States of the need for unified and coherent external action. The two of you will have to work hard to push, drag and lead, at a moment in history that we had intended to tackle with the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 – (ES)
 Madam President, Commissioner, I regret the Council’s absence in today’s debate. With regard to the Southern Neighbourhood, I shall make three points. Firstly, the European Union must support and facilitate the processes of democratic change. In the past, neighbouring authorities used their concerns over stability as a way of justifying their inaction. Secondly, I wish for economic prosperity for our southern neighbours; this requires a great deal of reforms, investments, and financial and economic aid, as well as trade, not just with the North, but also South-South trade, which is currently non-existent. I am concerned about the line being taken by the Commission and the High Representative, Mrs Ashton: in an article published in The New York Times on 18 March 2011, she appears to be advising those countries to specialise in agricultural exports to European markets. I disagree. Commissioner Füle is well aware of this, although he seems to be shaking his head. These countries need diversified economies and agriculture. I repeat: diversified. They also need to attend to their domestic food needs and not restrict themselves to a few export products which, in addition, cause concern for European farmers. We therefore need common sense and prudence on this issue. Thirdly, we need to revitalise the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and its projects, which can help in the economic modernisation of the Mediterranean countries. Unfortunately, the UfM is still in deadlock, there is no General Secretary, and it cannot continue to be hijacked by the lack of progress between Israel and Palestine. Ladies and gentlemen, we are facing a major challenge. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, as indicated in the Middle East Quartet Statement made in Munich, we would all like to see the end of negotiations between Israel and Palestine in September 2011 in the form of an agreed solution for the two states that will bring peace and security. Unfortunately, the prospects are not rosy. With only six months left, negotiations have come to a standstill, stalled over the question of the settlements. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that the loss of valuable time will benefit Israel, nor will it contribute to finding a successful solution. On the one hand, I am concerned that it will become ever harder to find moderate leaders in Palestine with enough political support to be able to conclude agreements with Israel, which is no easy task. On the other hand, if the settlements remain, it will become ever harder to create a truly viable Palestine state. Lady Ashton, I agree that the peace process should not be put on hold because of political upheaval in the region. If the current events result in democratic regimes, as we all hope, regimes that will listen to the wishes of the people, the climate in the region will become even less propitious for Israel. It may be that Israel will become even more isolated and come under greater pressure from some of its Arab neighbours. In conclusion, everyone, including Israel, would benefit from reaching a solution as soon as possible. I would therefore urge the European Union to contribute actively to restarting the peace process in close cooperation with the United States and the other Quartet members. Lady Ashton, I hope that there will be a high-level Quartet meeting this month, as set out in the Munich Statement. Can you confirm whether that will be the case? Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, I am very pleased that the Commission is preparing a communication on the European strategy for the Atlantic region. This is a region that has two major, related characteristics: its oceanic-maritime nature and its peripheral character. I will make four points. Firstly, I would stress the importance of its maritime aspect, because of which, the strategy must attach importance to the preservation of the marine environment, fishing, the environment, energies related to this marine environment, and tourism. Secondly, given the peripheral nature of the region, transport – so-called ‘connectivity’ – is very important, both between the areas that make up the Atlantic region and, above all, with the rest of the European Union. The trans-European transport networks, the highways of the sea and energy connections must be given priority. With regard to Galicia, my constituency, I also have in mind the high-speed connection with the north of Portugal and the Transcantábrico train. Thirdly, Commissioner, I believe that the strategy must not focus solely on maritime issues. It must, as Mr Cadec has said, have a significant land-based dimension which includes the objectives of social, economic and territorial cohesion. As the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow indicates, the strategy for the Atlantic region must be closely connected with the Europe 2020 strategy, and with regional development policy and future economic prospects. Finally, the various administrations and organisations that exist in the Atlantic region must be taken closely into account, including the regional government of Galicia and the Euroregion created with the neighbouring community of North Portugal, which were amongst the first in the European Union to create a European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation. All of this means that there is a need for the Commission to maintain a permanent dialogue with these regions and entities, during both the development of the strategy and its subsequent implementation.

Mr President, we need further clarification on the Supreme Military Council’s plans in Egypt. One specific undertaking is the holding of democratic elections within six months, following a constitutional reform led by experts. However, I have also read that next week we will see a new government supposedly including opposition representatives, according to the British Foreign Secretary. I think we all agree, in any case, that the best way forward is to have a transitional process, supported by the widest possible political consensus, until the elections are held. It would also be desirable for the social forces to work together to ensure that this transition is unburdened by major tensions. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union must support the democratic process and contribute to its success. Egypt is a key country, and developments there will be felt throughout the Mediterranean and the Arab world. I therefore welcome Baroness Ashton’s visit to Cairo next week. One further point: The Tunisians and the Egyptians have given us a lesson in the people’s desire for freedom. I hope the foreign ministers will not overlook this lesson when they come to assess the common position on Cuba, which is precisely aimed at attaining a democratic transition in that country, and which defends those who defend freedom. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Madam President, the events taking place in Tunisia and Egypt are very significant and it is possible that these processes of change will spread to other countries in the Mediterranean region, which is a region of the highest importance to the European Union. These countries are right on our doorstep and we have numerous strong ties of friendship with them. In the last decade, the European Union has been unable to persuade their authorities to undertake the necessary reforms. In the last parliamentary term I myself stressed that stability could not continue to be used to justify a lack of change, but rather that these countries needed profound political, economic and social reforms. Now change and reform are being demanded by the people on the streets. Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that the Council finally paid attention to these events on Monday and has taken a position. I too have the impression that the transition process in Tunisia is headed in the right direction. However, the wider perception is, unfortunately, that the European Union has been almost absent from these processes in recent weeks. We have heard several speeches by President Obama, we have heard statements from Secretary of State Clinton, and we have even heard about contact between the Tunisian Army and representatives of the US Army… The Union’s visibility has been in no way comparable. The Treaty of Lisbon’s new mechanisms should have been more active and visible, including the President of the European Council. Baroness Ashton, I welcome your trip to Tunisia in two weeks’ time, but I also believe that we must improve our capacities for prediction and reaction. Do we want to be a major global player? We need to start with being relevant at regional level, as a minimum. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).

Mr President, this debate is very necessary given the recent serious events that are affecting the religious freedom and even the lives of Christians. I am particularly referring to what has happened mainly in Pakistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Egypt. Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights sets out in great detail what it calls freedom of religion or religious freedom. Despite this, it is, unfortunately, a right that is little respected in some countries. We are now even seeing that those who profess the Christian faith can pay for it with their lives. Baroness Ashton, the European Union must robustly defend the right to religious freedom in general, clearly incorporating it into its external action and demanding respect, freedom and security for what is now the most persecuted religious group in the world, the Christian community. We must demand that all the governments concerned do what is necessary to prevent these attacks, and when that is not possible, to arrest and punish those responsible. Ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, freedom is a symbol of European identity, and that includes religious freedom, which is part of the basic core of human rights. That freedom is also a path to peace, as Pope Benedict XVI said in his message on 1 January. I would also like to highlight the essential role of Christianity in shaping the European identity. It would therefore be a sad paradox if the European Union did not demand as firmly as possible that the world protect the most basic rights of Christians and did not help them where it could. The European Parliament resolution sets out methods for better defending religious freedom in general and the freedom of Christians in particular. I welcome the fact that the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council is to give them close consideration, and – I am finishing now, Mr President – that the forthcoming European Council on 14 February is to give its opinion on these serious events, just as, for example, President Sarkozy very courageously did. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, this debate on Libya is taking place at a time when very significant changes are happening in another neighbouring Mediterranean country: Tunisia. I have always believed that the European Union must help to promote serious reforms in the Mediterranean region, with the aim of making it an area of freedom and prosperity. I refer to my speeches in this House in recent years, in which I have repeatedly said that the Union’s policy cannot be focused on simply maintaining the status quo
. This is not, however, the specific issue being debated today, which is the Framework Agreement with Libya. I would like to stress the need to cooperate with Libya in managing migratory flows, including an agreement to readmit illegal immigrants including third-country nationals, as is the case in all readmission agreements concluded by the Union. Giving in to Libyan positions that are contrary to this agreement would be detrimental given Libya’s important position as a transit country, and it would also send a very negative message for the negotiations with Morocco and Algeria on readmission agreements, which have been in deadlock for many years. However, we do also have to insist that the Libyan authorities respect the rights of refugees, including – as has already been said – the principle of non-refoulement. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would also like to express my concern regarding the impact of this agreement on the canned tuna fishing sector, which is very important in Spain and particularly in Galicia, my constituency. This negative impact is, as has been said, due to an unprecedented and ill-founded concession: the exemption from the rules of origin for processed fish products, when requested, due to not having sufficient indigenous raw materials. That was the first thing that Papua New Guinea did, and the exemption is being applied. Papua New Guinea is thus becoming a major platform for the processing and export of tuna from the European industry’s major competitors: the Philippines, Thailand, China and the United States. It is really they who are the major beneficiaries of the agreement. It is estimated that this tuna production will ultimately amount to 400 000 tonnes per year, destined for the European market, which currently consumes a total of around 710 000 tonnes. The impact will be very serious, as the prices of the tuna from Papua New Guinea are one third lower than the price of European tuna, due to the country’s low wages and non-existent environmental standards. In my region, Galicia, this is considered to be unbeatable competition, which will have serious consequences for employment. I want the impact assessment announced by the European Commission to be as rigorous as possible and to take into account the short and medium-term consequences of this exemption from the rules of origin. I hope that it will put an end to the application of this exemption as soon as possible. It is an exceptional and temporary measure, but it appears that in Papua New Guinea, they consider it to be a permanent one: otherwise, the investments would not be made. I also hope that this exemption is not included in other agreements or in the final agreement. Currently, however, there is a problem with the provisional agreement, and it must be rectified. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, the Union’s most important strategic relationship is the one it has with the United States. We must maintain a continuous dialogue on bilateral issues and also on global issues, and try to ensure the most coordinated action possible. In my view, this is the main message of tomorrow’s resolution. I therefore regretted the fact that the planned summit in May was not held. Moreover, I found the argument given at the time that there was no agenda to be absurd. There is always an agenda between two partners that are so important and which are immersed in a global economic crisis, and when there are challenges such as terrorism, climate change, energy security or nuclear proliferation. Moreover, there are major regional conflicts, for example, the Middle East peace process, the Iranian nuclear challenge or the issue of Afghanistan, which, in my view, are worthy of coordinated action by the United States and the European Union. I hope that the forthcoming Lisbon summit will be a success. There are many issues to tackle, some of which I have already mentioned. Moreover, the world is changing. Asia is in the ascendancy; let us think about the importance of China or India, which President Obama has just visited. There is even talk of a post-Western world. In this context of a changing world order, we need close coordination between Europe and the United States. We have many interests, ideals and values in common. We will be stronger if we act in a coordinated way. Ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has also created new bodies to strengthen the Union’s role in the world. We should therefore also improve our mechanisms for dialogue and coordination with the United States. The resolution adopted by Parliament in March last year contains many ideas as to how to strengthen those institutional mechanisms for dialogue between Brussels and Washington. My final comment is that I regret the fact that the representative of the Council only referred to an exchange of data; he did not come here to talk about the summit, about which we heard nothing. Unfortunately, the Commission did so only very briefly. Who really came here to talk about the summit? Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 – (ES) 
Mr President, I am really delighted that the European Council has discussed the Union’s external action. We are in a new world, which is multipolar from an economic point of view and increasingly from a political point of view, with a smaller number of significant players. Moreover, the challenges that we face are global ones. No country can face them alone, including the countries of the EU. As the President of the Commission said a few days ago, in a global world, size does matter. The European Union must be one of those players. I therefore regret the result of the vote in New York last week on strengthening the EU’s position in the United Nations. What happened is very concerning. I think it would be very good for careful preparations to be made in future for summits with the other major players. As well as tackling the way that the other players voted on 14 September in New York, they are also needed to tackle important bilateral and multilateral issues. Among other things, we need to govern globalisation, adapting the institutions that were established after the Second World War and strengthening more recent forums such as the G20. In doing all these things, I also think that we need to be working in harmony with the United States. We share many values and interests with them, and I trust that sound preparations are being made for the summit on 20 November. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union’s external action will have more continuity and consistency. However, along with the internal strength of the Union, the political will for joint action by the 27 is also essential, particularly among the most significant Member States. This process of uniting will inevitably be a long and difficult one. It is necessary, however, if we want to prevent Europe from being irrelevant and prevent what is beginning to be described as the advent of a post-Western era.

On behalf of the Spanish delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we would like to state that the reasoning behind our vote on the resolution on the process relating to the European integration of Kosovo is that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it were an independent state in an entirely normal situation, without taking into account the fact that the status of this territory continues to be very controversial within the international community – an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice is also pending – and Kosovo has not been recognised by five Member States of the European Union, including Spain. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Madam President, the importance of relations with Russia for the European Union is obvious: it is a powerful neighbour, a strategic economic and energy partner, and a permanent member of the Security Council. Russia now seems to be more peaceful and settled, thanks to the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the United States, overcoming its disagreement with the anti-missile shield and the agreements that it has reached with the new Ukrainian Government. Furthermore, the tension caused two years ago by its intervention in Georgia has decreased. In this new context, we all welcome Russia’s support of the recent Security Council Resolution 1929 on Iran. This is therefore a good time to improve relations with Russia. Consequently, Baroness Ashton, I regret the fact that there has not been any progress in the negotiation of the new partnership agreement with Russia that first requires Russia to join the World Trade Organisation, something that has also still not been clarified. Ladies and gentlemen, there needs to be an ambitious agreement that includes and regulates energy, investment and trade issues. Clear, legally binding rules are what is needed. Also, I do, of course, agree with the European Union supporting and helping Russia in its desire to modernise, but the Partnership for Modernisation, which was the framework for the relationship established at the recent summit, should not be an alternative to the aforementioned agreement. I certainly welcome the fact that the Presidency is including the effective functioning of the judicial system and stepping up the fight against corruption in that partnership. I will conclude now: what I also want is a single, efficient and coherent EU policy, and I hope that the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon – you yourself, High Representative, and the permanent President of the European Council – will help us to achieve this aim of a single, coherent policy.

Mr President, a preliminary clarification: in my view, either a representative of the Presidency of the Council, or, perhaps, of the current French co-presidency of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), should have spoken in this debate today; their absence is deeply regrettable. Ladies and gentlemen, it is a priority for the European Union to ensure that its closest neighbours form an area of peace, prosperity, freedom and security. This should be the primary objective of the UfM, which I hope is due to hold its second summit next month. I would like to congratulate Mr Peillon and to express my thanks, most especially, for his open-minded and extremely constructive approach. In spite of the proximity of the European Union to the southern shores of the Mediterranean, there are considerable differences separating us in economic, political, social, demographic and cultural terms, and so on. Some of these disparities are due to serious deficiencies in our neighbouring states. It is crucial to promote close dialogue and cooperation within the framework of the UfM, and to bring forward those major joint projects which it has identified, as well as the bilateral dimension of the association agreements, in order to strengthen the relationship between both shores and to be able to reduce these disparities. In order to achieve this, our neighbours, too, must implement reforms. Standing still cannot be an option. I would like briefly to raise three further points. Firstly, it is very important for the secretariat of the UfM in Barcelona to be fully operational as soon as possible. Secondly, and closely linked to the previous point, the UfM must not fall hostage to conflicts, such as that in the Middle East. The UfM can facilitate a solution but it does not claim to be the means to the solution nor should it be blocked by these confrontations. Thirdly and lastly, the UfM must also pay particular attention to what is known as Chapter Four of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation: migration, security, social integration and justice.

 Mr President, we are all concerned by the increase in violence in Ciudad Juarez, but I trust in the broad measures that the Mexican authorities have put in place in order to effectively tackle this complex situation. I also support the vigorous battle President Calderón is currently waging against drugs trafficking, which is a very serious global threat that concerns us all. That is why we should help the Mexican authorities in this difficult struggle. Ladies and gentlemen, over the past 10 years, Mexico has gone through a very positive process of political and governmental modernisation. President Calderón is steadily promoting reforms. Mexico has also taken on greater international responsibilities and is playing an active role within, for example, the United Nations and the G-20. In this Parliament, within my modest capabilities, I have always supported the establishment of a strategic partnership between the European Union and Mexico, which we finally achieved in 2008. I hope we can adopt an ambitious joint action plan or programme at the May Summit in Madrid, because the European Union and Mexico need to work together in many areas, both on a bilateral level and in multilateral forums, in order to confront challenges and threats together, including drugs trafficking and other forms of organised crime Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, the Union’s foreign policy is entering a new phase, as Baroness Ashton and Mr Albertini have said this morning. Article 21 of the treaty establishes objective principles. New positions are also created by the treaty, with a High Representative, a Vice-President of the Commission, a permanent President of the European Council, a European External Action Service, and a new Security and Defence Policy, which is the subject of the report by my colleague Mr Danjean, etc. These innovations aim to ensure that the European Union has a much more effective influence in the world, and I think that summits with third countries continue to be an ideal instrument for achieving this. The European Union does not hold many summits with individual countries, so we should take care with them. The summit held last week with Morocco was the first summit with an Arab country, and also symbolised advanced status being granted to Morocco. I would have liked you to have attended, Baroness Ashton. I also regret that the King of Morocco was not present. His absence meant that a summit that should have been historic lost political influence, significance and effectiveness. I hope that the Union for the Mediterranean Summit in Barcelona will also be successful in terms of the level of the delegations. I also regret the fact that the summit with President Obama planned for the spring is not going to take place. As the Albertini report states, the Treaty of Lisbon sets the stage for strengthening our mechanisms for dialogue with the United States. This and other subjects could have been dealt with at the summit. The European Union and the United States should not miss the opportunity to deal at a high level with the bilateral matters, conflicts and global challenges that are now mounting up on the world’s agenda. It would be paradoxical – and I will finish now – if now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, we ran the risk of becoming irrelevant in this world that some are now calling ‘post-Western’ or ‘post-American’.

Madam President, democracy and defending human rights have an important place among the Union’s principles and objectives for external action – I refer to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union. This Article also applies to relations with Cuba and with the Cuban people, who are very dear to us. Unfortunately, in the last five years, the Council’s actions appear to have been essentially governed by a desire to correct the line adopted in previous years, especially in 2003 when there was an extremely harsh wave of oppression in Cuba. In 2005, the Council suspended the 2003 measures. Subsequently, there were trips to the island by foreign ministers and commissioners. In June 2008, the 2003 measures were lifted and a global political dialogue was established – as Mr López Garrido reminded us – along with regular high-level meetings. A Head of State of a Member State even recently visited Havana. Unfortunately, the European political leaders who went to the island did not have any time to meet with the representatives of the dissidents, who therefore felt marginalised. Over all this time, repression in Cuba has continued. There have been no changes or reforms. Nevertheless, political dialogue has been maintained. Now we are all shaken up by the cruel death of the political prisoner, Orlando Zapata. As is well known, ladies and gentlemen, some governments, such as the Spanish Government, have repeatedly said that they want to cancel the common position. It says something very logical: support for democratic transition, essentially the same thing that is required by the principles and objectives of Article 21 of the treaty. I will conclude with two points. The common position has not hindered dialogue. This is obvious. What is more, it was reconfirmed recently by the 27 ministers, in June 2009. Secondly, the priority cannot be to change the common position – that would be the last straw! The priority now is to ask for the immediate, complete and unconditional release of all political prisoners. I see Cuba and Latin America as Western, and the symbols that identify the West are the dignity of human beings and respect for their fundamental rights. I have a final thought: I would like to remind the Council that, in its own conclusions in June 2009, it said that the future of political dialogue with the Cuban authorities was dependent on progress being made, in particular, on human rights. Can anyone say that this progress is taking place today? Can anyone really say that? Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, may I welcome the Commissioner. In this decade, enlargement policy has been the European Union’s greatest success, along with the euro. That policy should not be held back. Furthermore, we cannot break the commitments we have made with candidate countries, although we should also respect the well-known principles of consolidation and conditionality. We also should not forget the European Union's integration capacity or the need to communicate with citizens on the subject of enlargement and its advantages and consequences. Given the time restrictions, I shall just make a few brief comments. In principle, candidate countries should resolve beforehand any territorial disputes and similar issues they might have with each other and with Member States, so as not to later slow down the operation of the Union. In the case of Turkey, I would particularly like to highlight how important it is for the rate of reforms – which are also necessary for Turkey itself – to be maintained and even increased. I also welcome the recent commitment Turkey has shown with regard to Nabucco, which is very important for energy diversification in Europe. However, I must admit that I was somewhat surprised by the gesture that the Turkish Government made last autumn in support of the Iranian authorities. Indeed, I believe that a candidate country’s foreign policy should be in line with that of the Union. Finally, last week, I read an interview with the Turkish Minister for European Affairs which seemed to suggest that Turkey had abolished visas for countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Libya. I was somewhat surprised by this because a candidate country should also be bringing its visa policy closer to that of the European Union, not moving in the opposite direction. I would like confirmation of that information. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has strengthened the European Union’s commitment to stability and development in Afghanistan through the action plan. I would, of course, like to know more about funding for this plan as far as Afghanistan is concerned. Another very important moment for Afghanistan will be the London Conference in January. At that conference, we will hear about the specific pledges made by the European Union and its Member States. We should also hear from the new Afghan Government about the many commitments it must make in areas such as combating corruption and drug trafficking. I am rather alarmed at reports in today’s press of the speech given yesterday by President Karzai on the corruption issue. Ladies and gentlemen, President Obama’s decision to increase his military contingent by 30 000 troops is very recent. In short, Afghanistan is at a crucial stage and the United States and Europe must work in a very coordinated manner. What is at stake in Afghanistan is not only the prosperity and freedom of Afghans, but also the stability of the region, including such an important country as Pakistan. Our own security is also at stake, given the continuing threat posed by al-Qaeda, as has already been said. The credibility of NATO and of what we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan. We cannot fail. In order to succeed, though, as has also been said, we need the support of our own citizens. This support is conditional on transparency and clarity. We must explain that our compatriots in Afghanistan are in serious danger, but we must also stress the importance of the mission there and that failure cannot be an option. As I have said, many important factors are at stake. Francisco José Millán Mon and José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 With regard to the resolution on the Commission’s enlargement strategy paper for 2009, we would like to make it clear, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), that the fact that we supported it overall does not in any way mean that we agree with the recognition of Kosovo as an independent State. We feel that Kosovo is an exceptional case, and we would like to point out that it has not been recognised by Spain or by four other Member States. Consequently, both in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and today in plenary, we have supported the amendments that were in line with our viewpoint. Our vote in favour of the resolution is due to the fact that we do not want our position on Kosovo to be understood as a negative attitude to the enlargement process that the countries of the Western Balkans, Turkey and Iceland are now involved in. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).

 Madam President, the enlargement process has been a resounding success. The latest enlargement has allowed us to come together with those countries of Central and Eastern Europe that were unfairly denied freedom and prosperity after the Second World War. At present, enlargement is focusing on the western Balkans, Turkey and Iceland. I endorse the ideas that we have identified as the guiding principles of the enlargement process in recent years. I mean consolidation, conditionality and communication. That is to say, that we should fulfil our obligations, but not make rash promises on future enlargements. Secondly, progress in the various accession processes is subject to strict compliance with the conditions. The candidate countries must make a determined effort to carry out the necessary reforms. Thirdly, we must all make an effort to communicate with the citizens. The resolution we are to vote on tomorrow highlights the very important issue of communication. In this connection, I should like to reiterate the broader proposal I made on previous occasions, namely that it would be appropriate also to enhance young Europeans’ knowledge of the Union by making this a compulsory subject in the upper secondary school curriculum. Another relevant idea contained in the resolution is the capacity for integration. Enlargement requires existing Members of the Union to take certain measures. Regarding finance, for instance, enlargement calls for sufficient financial resources to ensure that essential community policies such as the common agricultural policy or cohesion policy are not put at risk. I am about to conclude. I should like to point out that as we are all aware, Kosovo is a special case. Unfortunately, however, there are sections of the resolution where this particularity is not made clear. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, with regard to the Fajon report, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to point out that, although we voted for the report, we do not agree with recital 2a, added by Amendment 4, which states that the Commission ‘should start a visa dialogue with Kosovo with a view to establishing a roadmap for visa facilitation and liberalisation similar to those established with Western Balkan countries’. In my delegation’s view, Kosovo cannot be put on the same footing as the Western Balkan countries. I would point out that Kosovo has not been recognised by the Spanish authorities or by any other Member States. Since the amendment I have mentioned was voted on in block voting with many other amendments, we were not able to vote against it, but we would like it placed on the record that we are not in agreement with its content.

Madam President, relations with Russia are very important: it is a permanent member of the Security Council and a military power; its cooperation is necessary in order to tackle the nuclear challenge of Iran, the issue of the Middle East, disarmament, climate change, etc. Moreover, Russia is a neighbouring country of Europe with which many EU Member States have significant economic relationships and high levels of energy dependence. It is a country with which we have two regular annual summits (which certainly provide a good opportunity at which to evaluate the state of the relationship). Now we are negotiating a new partnership agreement, which would increase cooperation in the so-called four ‘common spaces’. In my view, the most important of these spaces is the economic and energy space: we need openness, clear rules, guarantees for investments, and Russia first of all needs to join the WTO. Next week’s summit should therefore be an opportunity to clarify Russia’s intentions with regard to the WTO and to ensure it does not take initiatives that are incompatible with it. In addition, the gas supply crisis of recent years should not be allowed to recur and the new agreement must include the principles of the European Energy Charter which, as has already been said, is the treaty from which Moscow has unfortunately withdrawn. We must continue to work on the other three spaces as well. I have already mentioned the importance of Russia as a global player. Ladies and gentlemen, we can do many things together with Russia, but, as has also been said, there is one aspect of the relationship that we should not forget, since Russia is a European country and a neighbour. That is the need for it to respect human rights and the obligations that its membership of the Council of Europe imposes upon it in that regard. One of the most obvious failures of the EU’s external affairs policy is the lack of a common policy with regard to Russia. With the instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon, it will be simpler to create this common policy, but it is also necessary for us, as Member States, to have a genuine will to create such a united policy and not to continue prioritising bilateral channels with Moscow, which are, at times, openly divergent from each other. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, the relationship with the United States is, strategically speaking, the European Union’s most important relationship. The United States holds a key position in the world and the European Union is increasingly becoming a global actor. We can, and should, undertake many things together. First of all, we should take a leading role in creating a new, global world, featuring new challenges and the emergence of new actors. We need to further strengthen our relationship and create new institutional mechanisms. This is the right time to undertake such action. We have a government in Washington which favours multilateralism, a European Union strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon and we are witnessing the emergence of a new world which we want to shape together. The resolution we will adopt tomorrow specifically supports the strengthening of the institutional mechanisms, something which Parliament called for in its resolution of 26 March. The decision to create the Transatlantic Economic Council two years ago was the right one. However, in today’s world, we also need to develop excellent coordination in terms of policies and security. We need regular meetings between officials responsible for external affairs and security. That is why this House, this Parliament, supported the creation of a Transatlantic Political Council which, in the future, must include the energy council that you wish to establish at the next summit. The Parliament also wants two summits to take place every year. If we have two summits with Russia, why not with the United States? Ladies and gentlemen, there is increasing talk of a G2 being set up by the United States and China, that is to say, a privileged relationship between the top global players. It worries me that we Europeans may weaken our role as partners and undermine our privileged relationship with the United States. We must explain to the United States that, in the field of foreign policy, the Union will be strengthened by the Treaty. The European Union, or the Europe of today, is no longer the problem it had been for decades. Today, in this complex world, Europe should be part of the solution, and I hope that is the way the United States sees the situation. In order for this to occur, as the Commissioner pointed out, Europeans also need to act in line with the global role we want to have, and to be up to the mark, with respect to the privileged relationship to which we aspire with the United States. To summarise, a key issue for the upcoming summit, in my opinion, should be the strengthening of transatlantic relations, including at institutional level. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, given the EU’s dependence on external energy supplies, securing its supply is an issue which must always form part of the EU’s external policy. In addition, all predictions agree that energy demand in the world will increase significantly over the next 25 years. Here in Europe, we have to reduce our high dependence on Russian gas, particularly following the crises in recent years. There is also a clear strategy in Russia to secure its dominance in Europe over the gas sector. That is why we have projects such as Nord Stream, Blue Stream II and also South Stream. We therefore need to diversify in terms of suppliers and routes. That is the reason for the interest in Nabucco, which will give access to Azerbaijani and Iraqi gas, and also to gas from Turkmenistan, thus reinforcing our energy relations with Central Asia, which is an increasingly important region. I am therefore delighted about the agreement reached last July, as reported by the Commissioner, and also the explicit support given to Nabucco by President Barroso in the political guidelines that he recently presented. I know that there are doubts about the viability of Nabucco, but I also had doubts about the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, which is now a reality. I must stress that the countries around the southern rim of the Mediterranean also have an important role to play in the supply of gas to Europe. The main country in this respect is Algeria, which is an important supplier of gas to my country and to Italy. We must ensure that the work on the Medgaz pipeline is quickly completed. I also want to highlight countries such as Egypt and Libya in terms of gas supplies. To sum up, energy issues must be a priority in the Euro-Mediterranean relationship, to the benefit of both sides. Ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon includes energy as a shared responsibility and lays down that one of the EU’s energy policy objectives will be to guarantee the security of energy supplies. This really encourages us to move forward with developing an increasingly essential common foreign policy on energy, as stressed by the motion for a resolution to be adopted today. I will end by saying that this is a difficult objective, as proven by our failure in Europe, in the European Union, to achieve a true internal market in energy, because we do not even have the necessary interconnections. That is why I am delighted about the commitments made in this respect in the document mentioned by President Barroso. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I am here to talk about Iran, and I would first like to join in expressing my condolences for the victims of this morning’s plane crash. Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with many of the ideas that have already been expressed regarding the situation in Iran following the electoral process. This process was neither free nor fair, and has allowed President Ahmadinejad and the most radical sectors of the regime to remain in power, violently repressing demonstrators, preventing journalists from doing their job and seeking to hold a supposed external conspiracy responsible for internal disorder, while using misinformation to conceal the truth. What is certain is that the Iranian regime has been seriously damaged, both internally and in terms of its external image. Moreover, the oligarchy that has enjoyed power in recent decades is now divided, which will affect the stability of the regime. At the same time, discontent among the people will continue to grow, especially if oil prices do not rise again and consequently the economic situation does not improve. The European Union needs to maintain a united front and continue to condemn the abuses committed in Iran. It should demand greater respect for human rights, and we also need to look at how we can help civil society, in particular those sectors that want democratic pluralism and respect for human rights for their country. We should not disappoint those sectors that are looking to the West, including the European Union. However, with regard to Iran we must also not forget the threat that its nuclear programme represents, as it is having a destabilising effect on the region and on non-proliferation in general. It is essential that the European Union and the United States continue to cooperate on this matter, and I am sure that this will be a priority for the Swedish Presidency. We need to fully involve Russia and China, which are permanent members of the Security Council. Their support is essential in order for a negotiated solution to be found to this grave threat, which requires unity and firmness from the international community. I therefore welcome the resolution adopted in this respect last week at the G8. Ladies and gentlemen, the events of the last few weeks have openly demonstrated the extremism and radical nature of the current Iranian leaders; it is clear that the international community cannot afford for them to obtain nuclear weapons.

Mr President, Commissioner, these are tough times for the European fisheries sector. The serious economic crisis that is devastating Europe, the scarcity of marine resources needed to allow the fleets to be economically viable and the negotiations on agreements that are often unacceptable because of their detrimental interests, mean that the sector is looking towards the future with some concern. If we add to that the shameful obstruction of the multiannual plans by the Council, which is also seeking pretexts for reneging on the Treaty itself – something that we absolutely will not stand for – we end up with a panorama that is pretty bleak. We are discussing different aspects of great importance, including the external dimension of the common fisheries policy, which enables the EU fleet to fish in the high seas and in third-country waters, and through which the European Union also exports principles of good governance, leading the fight for sustainability, ensuring food security in the least-developed countries and eradicating illegal fishing. In all, 60 % of the fish consumed in the European Union comes from third-country imports and, as a consequence, one of the objectives of the external dimension of this policy must be to ensure the continuity of the economically viable high-sea fishing. We do not agree that the fisheries agreements should entail an exclusivity clause that prevents the European fleet from fishing in third-country waters when the European Union has failed to conclude a new protocol and we have several examples of that. Nor do we agree that there should be penalties for the temporary reflagging of EU vessels when they change their flag so that they can access third-country waters – even if those countries comply with all of the international regulations – where no agreement on access to resources has been reached. Similarly, we do not agree with the fact that the fishing authorisation fees that shipowners have to pay to access the fishery resources of a third country can triple on occasion without a cost-benefit analysis having been carried out. In my opinion, it is pointless to propose keeping fish stocks above, rather than at, maximum sustainable yield, as this would reduce fishing opportunities by more than is necessary. For these and other reasons, our group has tabled an alternative motion for a resolution, which, in our opinion, improves the rapporteur’s proposal. In conclusion, Commissioner – and I see that the Council is absent once again – fisheries is such an important sector that it is crucial for the three institutions to be able to reach agreement and work towards the same goal. Parliament certainly will. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

I am a firm advocate of programmes aimed at education and young people and specifically of the Erasmus programme, and I am concerned by the news regarding its immediate future. However, as a Member from an outermost region such as the Canary Islands, I am also concerned that our young people do not enjoy equal opportunities in the mobility measures financed by the EU. Young people from the Canary Islands cannot and should not be in a worse situation than other young people in the EU due to living in an outermost region. Youth unemployment figures in the outermost regions are really worrying and it is our duty to ensure that the additional cost of students travelling from their outermost region of origin is borne by the programme itself and not by the students, who often see this additional cost as an insurmountable obstacle that prevents them from accessing Erasmus grants. Yes there should be Erasmus for all, but that should include young people from the outermost regions. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, I am not going to talk about independence for Catalonia, I am going to talk about La Gomera, a small island which is part of the Canary Islands and which has experienced an appalling fire, a fire which began on 4 August and was not extinguished officially until last month, in September. Not only has the fire affected the Garajonay National Park, which has been a World Heritage site since 1986, it has also scorched around 11 % of the surface area of the island, and more than 4 000 people have had to be evacuated. The damage caused to the environment, to the economy and to the living conditions of the islanders has been estimated at around EUR 60 million and is very difficult to rectify. So, what I would like to talk about today is solidarity, the solidarity of Europe with a very small but very important part of the Europe which unites us, about Europe’s solidarity with La Gomera and its inhabitants. The Spanish Government has already requested the intervention of the Solidarity Fund. All that remains now is for it to become effective and for us to help La Gomera to move forward. We are talking about the future of the island and that future is something for which we are all responsible. Gabriel Mato Adrover,

Mr President, Commissioner, based on the fact that in my view the agreements with Peru, Colombia and Central America are tremendously damaging for European banana producers, and the Canary Islands in particular, and that the only safety margin we have left is economic compensation via the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), which I hope is obtained, I have to express my satisfaction, given that these reports have included many of our proposals, which I am grateful for. The negotiated safeguard clauses have been improved and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas has been strengthened. There will be greater transparency and exhaustive monitoring of banana imports into the European Union with prior surveillance measures. Moreover, and what I believe is an essential point, the Commission shall present an annual report on how the clause is functioning, which should include an examination of the development of banana imports and their impact on European production. These are all very positive elements. European banana producers, all of which also come from the outermost regions, need help during these difficult times. There still some way to go, but this is a very significant step. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, if I may, I shall use my speech in this joint debate on fisheries policy in order to make some demands. Today, we are debating good reports that properly define Parliament’s efforts to achieve sustainable fishing by preserving fish stocks, and which try to establish a common organisation of the markets in which consumers are not only protected but also well informed. In addition, we are stressing the need to take action against those who authorise unsustainable fishing, and we are doing so by discussing, debating and reaching agreements. Unfortunately, however, those efforts clash with the actions of those who sometimes confuse confidentiality with a lack of transparency, with protocol negotiations carried out behind Parliament’s back and, what is worse, behind the backs of those who should be benefiting from the very same agreement. Commissioner Damanaki, there is still time to rectify this situation. Please do so. Our efforts also clash with those who are less concerned about blocking instruments that are fundamental to developing the sector as they are about not losing powers which even the Treaty does not bestow on them. Mr Mavroyiannis, we still have time. Stop blocking the management plans. It is important for the fishing industry and therefore for the citizens of Europe and for us. Therefore, at a time of uncertainty with so many boats and so few fishing opportunities, with fierce competition from imported products and a considerable reduction in subsidies, we have an obligation to support this reform. We should do so bearing in mind the fishermen in Galicia, Andalusia, the Canary Islands and all the other regions of Europe. They expect something very simple from us: that we do not let them down. Gabriel Mato Adrover,

Mr President, Commissioner, I want to clearly express, with the resolution and conviction given to us by the force of reason, the Committee on Fisheries’ unanimous concern when it comes to possible agreements under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) on state responsibility for vessels’ activities. Ladies and gentlemen, in the fishing regulations of both the European Union and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), there is an overall principle that is paradigm in the regulation to control fishing activities and the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing: it establishes that the flag state is primarily responsible for controlling its vessels’ activities, wherever they work. Based on this principle, the flag state must, for example, certify that their vessels’ catches conform to legislation. This catch certification is essential to these catches being unloaded in EU ports and being sent to market. However, it is also essential to respect the adopted conservation and fishing management measures, the objective of which is to ultimately bring fish stocks up to sustainable levels for fishing. Many states without their own fleet must charter ships from other countries to fish, which is natural, as long as they comply with the legal requirements. That said, Commissioner, you are aware, as we all are, that many of these chartering states have neither the resources, the capacity, nor often the will to control the fishing activities of these vessels. You will agree that, if there is no guarantee of an effective control of fishing activities, it is absolutely impossible to fight against illegal fishing and it is very difficult to aid sustainability, which is the cornerstone of our common fisheries policy (CFP) and the focus of its reform, which we are currently debating in Parliament. In the latest CITES meeting, the Working Group on Introduction from the Sea discussed the flag state’s responsibility over the species covered by CITES, and proposed to transfer this responsibility to the chartering state for CITES species caught on the high seas. This working group will report to the Standing Committee of the Convention in July 2012 and this committee, in turn, will report to the Conference of the Parties (COP) at the March 2013 meeting, when a definitive decision will be taken. According to my information on the European Union, the Commission held a meeting with the Member States last Monday. During this meeting, the Commission appears to have inexplicably announced that there is no official position, that is, that the Member States are free to adopt whichever position they consider to be most convenient for their interests in the upcoming COP. If this is the case, Commissioner, you can understand that it is both disappointing and discouraging that the Commission has not taken a stand on such a vital issue, particularly during a period when we are reforming the CFP. I have been informed that in the coming days, there will be a meeting between Member States and the Commission itself to adopt a common position. I think that there is still time to rectify the situation and for the Commission to send out a clear and resounding message, preventing the derogation of what has been the basic principle up until now: the flag state’s responsibility. This issue is a lot more important than some irresponsibly believe. If the proposal goes ahead, it will set a precedent that will undoubtedly cause great harm to our fisheries management and to the fight against illegal fishing. The Commission cannot allow all the work undertaken hitherto to be thrown away. It has been a joint effort on two aspects in which Parliament is completely involved and which also involves regional organisations such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) or the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) itself. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will finish. Under no circumstances, in my opinion, should the charter state be granted responsibility for controlling their vessels’ activity; this must remain the flag state’s responsibility. This is the unequivocal position of the Committee on Fisheries of this Parliament, and I hope it is also that of the Commission itself. For that reason, I ask if the Commission could explain its position on the issue and how it will ensure that the primary responsibility of the flag state is maintained. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, we are debating herring, we are debating multiannual plans, but essentially, we are debating jurisdiction, the competencies of Parliament and the need for the Council to accept and most importantly respect what was established in the Treaty of Lisbon, and furthermore, to respect the decision of the legal services themselves. This is codecision and in this context, a political decision by the Council that not only calls into question the competencies of Parliament, something which we cannot or should not allow of course, but most importantly, puts the future of such essential issues as the reform of the common fisheries policy at risk. I am addressing the absent Council members and also the Commissioner today; I think the issue is much more important than some believe. Give some thought to the matter. Gabriel Mato Adrover,

Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, please believe me when I say that, with this being my first speech before this House as chair of the Committee on Fisheries, I would rather not have had to make it, because we are not only going to talk about fishing, total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas – although these are very important – but also issues of jurisdiction. The question I asked on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries relates to the Treaty of Lisbon and how it should be applied in the area of fisheries policies, and, as I said previously, this goes much further than an isolated discrepancy. It concerns the undertaking by the three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – to accept the rules of the game that we agreed upon, based on the premise which underlies the Treaty: to take appropriate decisions, each according to its responsibilities, in the interests of the citizens of Europe. There is no doubt that the new Treaty has made major changes to the decision-making process for fisheries policy, and understandably it is going to take time to make the necessary adjustments to ensure that the new procedures operate correctly and in full. However, unfortunately we have learned from experience in the two years since the Treaty came into force that the Council and, in some cases, the Commission continue to deliberately – or so I believe – put up obstacles in an attempt to prevent Parliament from exercising its new prerogatives. This is unacceptable. Parliament cannot accept under any circumstances that the Council should continue to operate as if nothing had changed, as if Parliament were a mere bystander and the Treaty of Lisbon and the new division of competences had never existed. Minister, Commissioner, whether you like it or not, Parliament cannot be excluded from making decisions on fisheries policy, whether internal or external. These are not my words, they are the Treaty’s. Now, once again, following the Commission’s proposal, the Council has sought to exceed the scope of Article 43(3) of the Treaty, quite unacceptably in our view, in an attempt to exclude Parliament’s voice from the decision-making process. The procedure laid down in this article clearly refers to the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, that is, decisions on TACs and quotas, and to these two aspects alone – not to a whole series of other measures for achieving the objectives of the common fisheries policy, which would be covered by Article 43(2). As is stated in the preamble to the question, technical measures, such as prohibition or restricted zones and periods, restricted fishing depths and specific requirements related to fishing gear can in no way be interpreted as falling under the remit of Article 43(3). Parliament’s position is quite clear. We have been stating it for some time now: you cannot take a broad interpretation which is in clear contradiction with any exceptional status. Our reaction, in various dossiers, has always been to seek proportionate measures. We clashed over the Venezuela–French Guiana dossier, when the Council decided to forge ahead without Parliament’s consent. We had no alternative than to go to the European Court of Justice. Also when we opposed the Council’s blocking of long-term plans for hake and anchovy; we disagreed and we chose the first reading to try to negotiate seriously with the Council for a second reading. In terms of TAC and quota regulations we have been even more tolerant, if that is possible. It has not escaped our attention that what was adopted in 2010 and 2011 – in both cases on the basis of Article 43(3) – was done incorrectly. We continued to insist that sufficient time should elapse before the Council and the Commission could take joint decisions and were operating correctly. However, now of course we realise that in this case they are introducing a recital on certain conditions, functionally linked to the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, when clearly the concept of associated conditions, formerly covered in Article 20 of the Regulation, has been explicitly omitted from the new Treaty. The Members of the European Parliament thought that we should allow some time to elapse. However, we are – and I say this clearly – most disappointed because in 2012, three years after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, there are still major discrepancies between what the Commission proposes and what the Council approve, on the one hand, and what the Regulation states on the other. In my view, neither institution has given any indication that it is willing to abandon this broad interpretation of Article 43(3) for once and for all, and adopt another procedure that is more respectful of Parliament’s prerogatives. To conclude, there is unanimity among groups, coordinators and all the Members. We have made our approach very clear in our oral questions and I would like the Commission and the Council to answer the questions we have put to them today just as clearly.

 Mr President, the feelings of hundreds of thousands of farmers in many regions in Spain can be summed up in a simple but resounding word: ‘no’. We say ‘no’ to an unbalanced agreement; ‘no’ to an agreement without even a single guarantee that customs duties will be paid or fraud prevented; ‘no’ to an agreement that allows unfair competition against our farmers, inducing them to abandon their crops. In short, we say ‘no’ to the disappearance of fruit and vegetable farmers in regions such as Andalusia, Murcia and the Canary Islands. Our ‘no’ should not come as any surprise. It is a consistent ‘no’, just like our consistent ‘yes’ to the fishing agreement. We have not changed tack. We are defending today what we defended last July in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. We voted against then, and we will vote against once more on Thursday, because nothing has changed. However, we do not want anyone to see this as a ‘no’ against the Kingdom of Morocco, which is a preferential partner, and should continue to be one in the future. While Morocco may benefit from the European Commission’s inability to amend the regulation on entry prices, it is not responsible for it. I will finish by saying that our ‘no’ today is also a ‘yes’. It is a clear ‘yes’ to our farmers; a ‘yes’ to reciprocity and strict respect for agreements; a ‘yes’ to good relations between the European Union and third countries; a ‘yes’ to being able to continue farming; and lastly a ‘yes’ to differences being defined by quality, not by fraud. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is clear that something is wrong when we are debating an extension today, in the month of December, which ends in scarcely two months. Nonetheless, we are discussing an agreement that is important to the European Union and to Spain in particular, an agreement that cannot be used as an excuse for diverse claims that are not strictly fishing based, and one which I agree should be extended despite the fact that many aspects of the agreement are unsatisfactory. I have always defended agreements with third countries, and even more so with neighbouring countries and those of such importance as the Kingdom of Morocco. It is precisely for that reason that I hope that the extension will be ratified and that a new agreement is negotiated, which is balanced, fair and beneficial for all signatories and allows our fleet to continue working. I am confident that this agreement will be reached, and that, as well as being economically viable and guaranteeing the sustainability and conservation of resources, it will also have positive consequences for the signatories from a social and working perspective. However, I also robustly defend that the agreements must be respected and comprehensively fulfilled, and for that reason and to be consistent, I questioned the agreement with Morocco for the agricultural sector and I emphatically support the agreement for the fishing sector. We do not have anything against Morocco, quite the opposite, but this does not detract from the fact that we demand that the agreements are respected as is deserved by the citizens we represent. This Parliament should send a clear and open message to the Commission that they should negotiate and negotiate well, without delay and with transparency. Remember that poor negotiations always bring poor consequences. There are many examples. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, much has been said over recent days about the volcano on the island of El Hierro, in the Canary Islands. I was there last Friday and experienced for myself, along with the people of El Hierro, an earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale. I can assure you that it was not a pleasant situation to be in. However, it was even more unpleasant to see the situation in which the thousands of inhabitants of this small and very European island find themselves, with their lives determined by the volcano and continuous seismic activity. The tunnel linking the two main cities on the island is closed, people cannot go out to fish, and businesses are being closed down. People are seeing a major crisis grow to terrible proportions, and they can do nothing but wait. This wait is unsustainable from an economic perspective. Fishermen, farmers, small business owners, hoteliers and society as a whole all urgently need Europe’s assistance and economic support in order to tackle not only the present situation, but also an uncertain future. The European Union must be where it is needed. That place today, more than ever, is the island of El Hierro. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, it is precisely in situations of crisis that the efficiency of and confidence in institutions is seen. In this case, they have left much to be desired. The Commission has said precisely that suspicions about Spanish cucumbers have not been confirmed. No, Commissioner: what has been confirmed is that the suspicions were unfounded, irresponsible and without objective data; what has been confirmed is that there are 23 dead and that the Spanish horticultural sector has suffered enormous damage. What has also been confirmed is that the Commission must do what it has not done up to now, which is to act with conviction on various fronts: stop the outbreak; prevent unfounded suspicions from being given a glimmer of credibility, seriously affecting a Member State – in this case, Spain – by taking the necessary measures to achieve this; compensate the damage suffered without delay and restore to the Spanish brand its image of safe, very high quality agricultural products. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, the best thing about asking a question is that you get an answer, even if, in this case, it could be considered disappointing in some ways. The fisheries sector is clearly in crisis: fishers’ incomes are lower every day, making it difficult to continue working in this field in many cases. We are not talking about stealth subsidies or unsustainable practices: we are talking about problems that require our full support. We suggest it time and again, and reiterating a fair demand, as Mr Cadec has done, cannot be reproached: he is being consistent. Nobody has suggested increasing fishing efforts. We do not understand why measures that are immediately relevant to exceptional situations have to be rejected. We are just suggesting that the Commission not turn its back on a sector that urgently needs aid, and this aid can, today, be an increase in de minimis
 aid. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, the tomato growers of the Canary Islands, Murcia, Andalusia and the Community of Valencia, all of them European Union producers, need the Commission to take robust action with regard to an unfair situation which is causing them serious damage. Fraud is being committed, and you know it. Thanks to its agreement with the EU, Morocco benefits from an entry price to which it does not adhere. In addition, we should not only look at 2007, but also at 2010. The Commission is well aware that Spanish tomato growers have to compete with Moroccan growers under unfair conditions, as they must bear much higher production costs stemming from the strict European standards on quality, food safety and workplace safety, as well as restrictions on pesticides which are not required of third countries. Even so, our growers, with great effort and commitment to quality, continue to work hard to save their crops. Thus, it is unacceptable for the Commission to ignore the malfunctioning of the entry price regime, whose complexity encourages fraud, as the European Anti-Fraud Office itself does, and for the Commission to look the other way when the tomato quotas agreed with Morocco are being contravened. It is not enough for the Commission to tell us that surveillance is the responsibility of the Member States. If they fail in their duties, the Commission must act. It is intolerable for regulations on Moroccan import quotas to be breached, and for the applicable customs duties to go unpaid, without the Commission taking any action. The Commission would have us approve a new agreement with Morocco. Unless we are given assurances that the price system will be modified to prevent unfair competition between Moroccan and Spanish produce, we will certainly not be supporting that initiative. It is your obligation to ensure adherence to agreements, but it is also your obligation to defend the interests of growers in the Canary Islands, Murcia, Valencia, and Andalusia. Do it before it is too late. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Madam President, I would respectfully inform Mr Campbell Bannerman that his banana is not from the Canary Islands. Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to talk about bananas in this plenary sitting and I think that it is positive that bananas are being talked about here. It is positive because it is important to reiterate the need for EU banana producers to be protected, including those in the Canaries. I think this because I believe that the conclusion of the Geneva Agreement on Trade in Bananas is not good news for EU producers. Moreover, there are aspects of the resolution that we are debating today that are not completely satisfactory from the point of view of agriculture and of protecting EU banana producers. However, I am aware that this proposal originates with the Committee on International Trade, whose criteria relating to several issues are very different from those that I am able to have. I will therefore assess the positive aspects of the proposal and not the negative ones. It is positive that it brings to a close so many years of disputes in the World Trade Organisation, thus restoring tranquillity to a sector that needs certainty and stability for the future above all else. EU producers belong to the outermost regions, which have enormous problems producing bananas – or excellent-quality ones, anyway – and whose banana production is nothing like that in third countries in any respect, including in terms of cost, workforce, the environment or of plant protection safeguards. From an agricultural point of view, it is important to stress that the agreement is damaging to EU producers. We are facing drastic cuts in tariffs, from EUR 176 to EUR 114 per tonne and EUR 75 per tonne in the case of the agreements with Colombia and Peru. Therefore, Commissioner, with all due respect, I can tell you that it is not credible that there were provisions for this drop in tariffs in the financial detail of the 2006 Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), because it is not true. The Commissioner said that it was provided for in relation to the Geneva Agreement; let us bear in mind that this tariff is EUR 114. There could never have been provision in 2006 for the tariff to decrease to EUR 75 as there is following these agreements. I therefore believe that the necessary evaluations should be carried out and it will be confirmed that it is absolutely necessary for the financial details of the agreement to be updated because, inter alia
, the Commission already saw the tariff of EUR 176 per tonne itself as low when it was implemented. EU producers are not, therefore, asking for anything that is not wholly justified, and we in Parliament have an obligation to protect them, as does the Commission. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, in my speech, I am going to focus on two reports whose procedure and final results are an example of what to do and what not to do. I am referring to the plan for anchovy stocks and the use of exotic species in aquaculture. Regarding anchovies, an example of how not to do things, the subject has been under discussion for more than one year and, unfortunately, it has become a debate on the powers that the Treaty of Lisbon grants to Parliament and on the legal basis for the Commission proposal, rather than a debate on what is better for fishermen, industries and fisheries. It has been a long and futile debate, the victim of which has been the sector, which has looked on in astonishment as we have become lost in discussions while the long-awaited management plan has yet to move forward and is in danger of never seeing the light of day. People who work in the anchovy sector are rightly complaining about the administrative hindrances that this plan is facing, when it is so essential for avoiding further interruptions to the activities of this fishery. I sincerely believe that, given this background of uncertainty, the Commission should seek to send a positive signal to the sector today in Parliament. On the contrary, with regard to the use of exotic species, the agreement reached by Parliament at first reading is a good compromise. The Commission, the Council and Parliament have succeeded in reaching an agreement quickly and without major disagreements over law or fact. The agreement not only establishes a strict definition of closed aquaculture facilities, but also achieves greater legal clarity for the businesses in the sector and, more importantly, removes a piece of the bureaucracy that Europeans have had enough of. I am convinced that the administrative processes need to be reduced to an essential minimum. Europeans have to deal with excessive bureaucracy, which makes it extremely difficult to start up or operate any activity. Therefore, reports such as today’s that remove administrative procedures are not only good news for the aquaculture sector but should also be a constant feature of the way in which we work.

Madam President, I am also going to talk about Venezuela, because there are some people who do not understand that democracy is not just about casting votes. Democracy is being able to do so with security, freedom and equality, and in a democracy and under a system of freedoms, private property must also be respected. Unfortunately, at present in Venezuela, the public and their businesses are under threat. In this respect, I would like to mention one business, Agroisleña, which was founded by people from the Canary Islands and on which more than 1 000 families depend. It has been unfairly expropriated, and like so many other businesses, after many years of hard work, it is failing, following capricious decisions by those who think that anything goes. First, land was confiscated, now businesses are being confiscated, so who knows what will be next? It is time for the people of Venezuela to feel free and for businesspeople to no longer feel defenceless and permanently under threat. As has already been said, it is time for Venezuela to be a genuine democracy where there is no doubt that terrorists will not find refuge. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, if we are talking about territorial cohesion, we have to talk about islands, mountain regions and also the outermost regions. It means talking about their problems and difficulties, their natural disadvantages and their structural handicaps. However, it also fundamentally means talking about how we can remove the obstacles that prevent their development. It means talking about strategies for converting those disadvantages into opportunities. Improving connectivity, an adequate neighbourhood policy and stability in policies and in the Structural Funds are issues that we need to tackle without hesitation, on the basis of two major premises: territorial cohesion and the principle of solidarity. There are people who do not believe in strategies. I do believe in them, and this resolution should be proof of Parliament’s commitment to these regions and of its demand for the Commission to make political decisions that take into account the needs of these vulnerable areas, whose problems become even more harshly evident in times of economic crisis such as we are experiencing at the moment.

Madam President, it is two years and one month today since the air accident that claimed 154 victims at Barajas Airport, Madrid, and tore apart many families, most of which were in the Canary Islands. All Members share their pain. Unfortunately, today, two years later, the technical investigation has not been concluded. The victims’ families are still wondering what happened and they have no answers. I find this state of affairs regrettable for two fundamental reasons: firstly, because the victims’ families do not deserve it, and secondly, because important information that would be fundamental for air safety and could be essential to preventing further incidents is not coming to light. I trust that this regulation that we will adopt tomorrow will at least, among other things, help to speed up the technical investigation processes and to ensure that these situations are not repeated. I share the concerns expressed by my colleague, Mr de Grandes, and I congratulate the rapporteur on achieving an agreement at first reading, but I hope that we have not given in on too many things in order to satisfy certain interests: it is the victims that are important here and they come first.

Mr President, once again, we are going to talk about free trade agreements between the European Union and third countries. I have already spoken about the agreements with Colombia and Peru, which are extremely damaging to the banana industry in the Canary Islands, and today, I wish to talk about Morocco. On 16 September, the Commission adopted its proposal on a new agricultural chapter of the association agreement with Morocco: a proposal that increases the tomato quotas, maintains the October to May period instead of extending it to the whole year, and does not revise the entry price system which has been proven to be fraudulent, as recognised by The European Anti-Fraud Office itself. This agreement is lethal for EU producers, essentially in Andalusia, Murcia, Valencia and the Canary Islands, and the Commission is perfectly aware of that. The Commission cannot look the other way and propose a fresh agreement with no guarantees when the current agreement is being violated without any measures being taken. There needs to be an urgent review of the entry price system and I ask the Commission to undertake one without further delay. The Commission has an obligation to defend farmers, so defend them!

 Madam President, this is not the first time that I have spoken about Venezuela and the breaches of human rights that are occurring in that beautiful country and I fear it will not be the last. During my previous speech I referred to journalists. Today I am referring to judges such as Judge Afiuni, and as always to ordinary Venezuelans, who, like the thousands of canaries that live there, only want to live in peace and freedom. These people aspire to safeguard their land and their affairs without the permanent uncertainty of ‘what will happen tomorrow’. Venezuela has been a land of refuge for many. Today, unfortunately, it is a country where freedom of expression and other freedoms and rights are mere memories. We are talking here today about human rights and who is breaching them. May our support go out from here to Judge Afiuni, and to everyone living in Venezuela, together with our hope that political freedoms will once more be a reality. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with a reform that is simple but extremely important for the outermost regions. This is especially the case at a time when the crisis is affecting everyone, but is affecting these regions in a fundamental way, as they have permanent structural handicaps that mean that they need these changes. I am going to talk about the Canary Islands. In the case of the Canary Islands, the most important change is regarding supplies of milk-based preparations intended for industrial processing. We are talking about skimmed milk powder with vegetable fat, which is a traditional product for local consumers that has been sold in the Canary Islands for more than 40 years. After a great deal of effort and despite many difficulties, a local industry was established that generates employment and obvious added value. I would like to highlight this because, in the current times, particularly on our islands, which have extremely high unemployment, supporting a small industry that creates jobs is not only a necessity but an obligation. The proposal is to maintain the supply of this product, which is used for local consumption in small quantities of 800 tonnes per year. This would eliminate the transitional nature of the measure, which is of little importance in the global context, and therefore give stability to this industry. As I said before, the outermost regions have significant handicaps, but they must be considered an opportunity for Europe. The different association agreements that are being worked on and debated at the moment, such as the free trade agreements with Colombia and Peru and others on which negotiations are beginning, such as with Mercosur, are a clear threat to our agricultural sector. I am thinking about numerous products: tomatoes, bananas, and the livestock sector. I have said this many times: these agreements must achieve a balance, whereby everyone surrenders a little ground, so we all win. However, in no way must one product or one specific sector be forced to bear the cost of the agreements. Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Alves, and thank the Commission and the Council who, along with Parliament, have succeeded in reaching an agreement in this first trialogue on agriculture. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Madam President, I am going to talk about tourism, a fundamental sector for the Canary Islands, which receive around 12 million tourists per year. If there is one thing that tourism needs, it is certainty. Situations like the one that we have experienced – and which may be repeated – have dramatic consequences for this strategic sector for the Canary Islands. The losses have not only been suffered by the airlines, the airports and the tour operators: hotels, car hire companies, restaurants and services in general have suffered huge damage. Between 15 and 23 April alone, 313 818 aeroplane seats were cancelled in the Canary Islands, with losses of around EUR 57.3 million as a result of the tourists not coming. This is, of course, a significant loss. We need immediate measures when the event occurs, such as opening airports at night without additional costs and looking after the public, the passengers, properly; but we also need compensation. I am not going to criticise what was done or what was not done or say whether the crisis was managed well or not. It is only worth being aware that it could happen again and that we need to be prepared for it. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, last week Europe missed a great opportunity: the opportunity to be the world leader in astrophysical research for the next twenty years. The European Southern Observatory decided, on the basis of reports which were far from transparent, that the European Very Large Telescope would be located in Chile and not in the Canaries. This is a time to congratulate Chile, but also to reflect on whether in Europe everything possible was done to have a European installation, decided on by a European institution, with European funding involving an investment of more than EUR 1 billion, located in Europe rather than in the Americas. The European Parliament was unanimous in its support for locating it in La Palma and I am grateful for that, but what did the Council do? What did the Spanish Presidency do? Did it hold any meetings with the Observatory? Did it hold any meetings with any of those Member States responsible for deciding on the location of the telescope? Did it really support the European bid? Europeans from La Palma, the Canaries and the rest of Europe are waiting for answers on this. At the moment they are left with the conviction that not everything was done that could have been done. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, although it is merely an administrative issue for certain people, for others it is much more. We are talking about freedom. I know that for some people freedom must be defended in certain ways and in certain places. However, I also know that for some people, true freedom, their own freedom, is one that is imposed by certain dictators whom they defend and in some cases they even encourage and not the freedom of people like us who defend this word to its fullest extent, who believe in free media and who believe that land cannot be taken by decree. You should ask the thousands of people from the Canary Islands who have been subjected to this situation in Venezuela. We are talking about rights, plurality and freedom. Unfortunately, certain people do not believe in this yet. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, last December, the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco entered into an agreement to liberalise trade in agricultural products. Unfortunately, the only information we have on the content of this agreement has been gleaned from the media. This information indicates an increase in the quota for tomatoes imported into the European Union, something we categorically reject, as the Kingdom of Morocco has repeatedly failed to honour its obligations to the European Union. The European Commission refuses to admit to the existence of this situation, even though OLAF itself has done so. We cannot allow the Commission to continue turning a blind eye, disregarding the needs of producers in the Canary Islands, Andalusia, Murcia and Alicante. We therefore appeal strongly for agreements to be honoured and for more attention to be paid to plant health controls. In addition, the timetable for Moroccan exports should be made more flexible, allowing exports to be spread across the entire year. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, the situation in the agricultural sector is not only of concern. I would call it unsustainable: farmers’ incomes are declining and every day there is a greater difference between what farmers receive and the market price for consumers. Succession is already a Utopia, and association agreements are repeatedly infringed, as in the shameful case of tomatoes from Morocco, a situation that has been recognised by the European Anti-Fraud Office with no decisive action by the Commission. Plant health rules and controls are applied to varying degrees, creating entirely unfair situations. If we add to this isolated cases, such as the decrease in duty for the banana sector, which is going to have entirely negative consequences, or the fact that it is impossible for livestock farmers to afford input costs, you will agree with me that the future of the sector is, at the very least, uncertain. Moreover, for agriculture in the most remote regions, the future is not only uncertain but extremely worrying. Farmers want to continue farming, but it is becoming more difficult for them every day. The Commission must accept the importance of agriculture. Face up to it boldly! Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, agreements should be honoured and rules should bind everyone equally. This statement, which may seem obvious, is not so obvious in reality when we are talking about the Association Agreement between the European Union and Morocco, which contains consistent irregularities, as recognised by the European Anti-Fraud Office. Spanish tomato producers, particularly in the Canary Islands, are going through a difficult time, and need the agreement to be honoured, but also want to know what the Commission plans to do about the new agreement that is still being negotiated: whether an increase has been offered in the preferential tomato quota and under what terms, whether the entry price system is going to be changed to prevent further breaches in the future, and whether the plant health requirements demanded of European producers are going to be enforced. Also, while we are talking about agreements, banana producers are also following negotiations, in some cases bilateral negotiations with third countries, with a great deal of concern, because such dealings could have irreparable consequences if they do not go hand in hand with compensatory measures. In both cases, the Commission cannot abandon its producers and we cannot allow that to happen. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, a fire is always a tragedy, a tragedy for people, a tragedy for the environment, an economic and social tragedy. I had the misfortune to live very close to this tragedy, to the fire that took place this summer on the island of La Palma in the Canaries. I therefore welcome this resolution and I am convinced that we are going to be able to adopt it unanimously. It is a complete resolution, which has received many contributions and which, above all, does something important. First of all, it remembers the victims, all the victims, and pays tribute to all those who work voluntarily to put the fires out. However, it also includes some significant reflections on the importance of drought and desertification in the spread of the fires, and the resulting disappearance of hundreds of thousands of hectares per year. There are also important reflections on the causes that aggravate the fires, such as the gradual abandonment of the countryside, deficient maintenance of the forests and inadequate punishment for arsonists. In this respect, we need to act and we need to act firmly. The Commission needs to draw up a risk prevention strategy and an effective strategy for combating natural disasters, and a protocol for uniform action. However, aid is also important, for restoration, for re-establishing production potential and for compensating for the social costs and job losses. As the Commissioner said, coordination is vital. However, there needs to be coordination between the different Community instruments: the Structural Funds, the Solidarity Fund – which clearly needs to be reformed – and their flexibility, and also instruments such as Aid Plus and, of course, the rapid response mechanism that we have already discussed. We need to go further in solving these problems, and I sincerely believe that this resolution is the right way to do so. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Mr President, I believe that the thing we politicians must be able to tackle is unforeseen circumstances. I believe the European Council tackled the unforeseen, and I think it did well – and I say this standing alongside my friend Mr Atkins – in not giving in to Mr Cameron’s blackmail. I also believe it did well in seeking an alternative solution, the intergovernmental treaty. Sometimes, God moves in mysterious ways. We have an intergovernmental treaty that will be easier to approve than the reform of Article 48, and which will come into force sooner. The crux of the matter – and I am addressing the President of the European Council, my friend Herman Van Rompuy – is to do it quickly and for Parliament to be involved in the exercise. This seems fundamental because, returning to the metaphor of the lunch used previously by Mr Verhofstadt, I believe that if the European Council makes this lunch without Parliament, there will be no dessert.

 Mr President, President of the Commission, today was an important day, and Mr Barroso’s speech was an important one. I think you have achieved a good result, because you have established the three Cs: courage, credibility and confidence. It has been said here that the Community method is antiquated. However, the Community method has brought us many years of peace and prosperity. The Commission plays a vital role in that method; indeed, it lies at the very heart of it. It is therefore very significant that today, at this time of crisis and confusion when our people are asking for guidance, the President of the European Commission has made such a committed speech. Mr Barroso, you can count on Parliament’s political support when those commitments are turned into initiatives. I offer you my congratulations. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Madam President, I do not think this is the first debate we have held on this topic in Parliament. We had it in 2008, 2010 was the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion when we put forward a written declaration, and we are now putting an oral question to the Commission. What I mean is that, firstly, Parliament has always been concerned about this problem, which is a real one, because one often hears it said that we are preoccupied with institutional issues in which people are not interested. Institutional issues are important, but the issue of poverty is a genuine one and those of us who are present here tonight are demonstrating our concern. Secondly, it is true that – as the Commissioner has said – the action plans are essentially national plans. This is so. However, it is true that we can also do things at a European level. We did this – as Ms Berès will recall – when, at the insistence of this Parliament, we included the reference to social exclusion in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the struggle against poverty among the EU’s goals. I believe that very soon, we shall have the opportunity to take concrete action. I am referring to the debate and vote on the European Union budgets. These will take place very shortly and I think this will be an opportunity for demonstrating our commitment. The third point I should like to make, Madam President, is that it is very important to combat social exclusion and to combat poverty, but it is even more important to respect human dignity. A person suffering from poverty is one who possesses all the fundamental human rights, and we need to recognise this. Recently, I watched a film on Father Brezinski which I would recommend that my colleagues see, because this film demonstrates that the fight against inequalities is closely linked to the fight for dignity. Finally, Madam President, I would not wish to overlook one fact. From certain speeches, it would seem as if the defence of the European social model were the exclusive heritage of one particular political group in this Chamber. This is not the case. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and in all groups place great importance on the European social model, because this defines us, and because this is part of our identity. Therefore, I think that together – and both this question and the resolution show this – we will continue to fight for it to remain so. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon grants Parliament the power to initiate a reform of the Electoral Act, and therefore we have to do so. We also have to do so because, soon, the MEP seats in Parliament will be redistributed with the entry of Croatia. Therefore, the report by Mr Duff, whom I want to congratulate for the work he has done, is included in this field. The Electoral Act, as you know, dates back to 1976. A great deal of time has elapsed since then, and we therefore need to improve it. The debate taking place today is likely to focus on the pan-European list, and I say pan-European because my group has tabled an amendment along these lines that we will uphold, with all the more reason today, in honour of the recently deceased Archduke Otto von Habsburg, who used the term ‘Pan-Europe’. The pan-European list appears to raise serious doubts. Some people are telling us, ‘It is too soon.’ However, I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, that on 8 May 1950, an advisor told Chancellor Adenauer or Mr Schuman, ‘Minister, Chancellor, it is too early to make a Franco-German agreement to pool coal and steel.’ For conservatives, everything is always too soon. For those who want nothing to change, it is always too soon. For those of us in favour of progress, those who want Europe to move forward, we want to have high hopes, Madam President. One of William Faulkner’s characters said, in a very glorious way, ‘Our dreams must be like mountains so that, wherever we are, we can see them and pursue them.’ The transnational, pan-European list fits into this idea of dreams, ideals, poetry and struggle. Madam President, the style of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is to have the greatest possible consensus. We will seek the consensus needed to introduce it here. Nevertheless, as Paul Valéry said about every poem, ‘It is never finished; only abandoned.’ Today we are abandoning it, but we will come back to it, Madam President. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
). 
 – Madam President, Mr Kožušník, who is no longer here, said of my speech that I was in the mountains. Maybe, but I prefer to be in the mountains than to be in the past.  (FR)
 My colleague, Mrs Auconie, and Mr Kožušník, expressed how hard it is to explain to their constituents why we are dealing with institutional matters rather than real-life issues. It was a Frenchman, Jean Monnet, who explained that politics needs institutions. Commissioner, before this debate, we held another debate today on the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union. Let me tell you that with a little intelligence and ingenuity, anything is possible. At the end of the day, in response to the argument that the transnational European list would disadvantage the smaller States, we need to remember that the Presidents of the Commission have included Gaston Thorn and Jacques Santer. Mr Juncker is the President of the Euro Group. Are they from large countries? Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Mr President, when I first entered this House 20 years ago, this debate would not have taken place, because this House was a consultative parliament at the time, and many of us have battled over the last 20 years to make it what it is today, a co-legislator parliament. However, when one co-legislates, one must be responsible. It is an exercise in responsibility that is now in need. A part of this House has adopted the old May 1968 slogan, according to which it is realistic to demand the impossible. Obviously, if one demands the impossible, it ultimately becomes impossible to agree on anything. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has not negotiated with any individual groups. We have negotiated with all the groups. However, we have only reached agreements with those that were ready to do so. Mr President, it is my belief that much progress has undeniably been made with the Commission’s proposal, the Council’s position and what is now on the table – which will be put to the vote tomorrow – if they are examined objectively. This is the real controversy or dilemma that we will have to resolve tomorrow. At the end of his fruitful existence, Miguel de Cervantes said that there were moments in life when one must choose whether to be a road or an inn. By being an inn, Cervantes meant lying still, complaining that one is ignored and remaining static. Being a road means moving forward, overcoming obstacles, knowing that not all has been achieved, that the road is probably not the one we would like to be walking on, but going on walking all the same. This is what I believe this House should do tomorrow: walk on, resolve the differences we still have with the Council, but look towards a time when the crisis is hitting all Europeans. It is not responsible at this juncture to say ‘I am not happy with this, goodbye, have a nice day’. Responsibility means walking. Therefore, Mr President, I think that in tomorrow’s vote we will convene another meeting with the Council to be held in July. As another poet used to say – Mr Sosa Wagner has quoted a German poet, I will quote a French one, Paul Valéry – poems are never finished, they are simply abandoned. We will abandon the end result until July, and I hope that the Hungarian Presidency, which has proved so successful, will also be able to reach an agreement that satisfies everyone. Thank you, Mr President, and may I point out that this is the first time in 20 years that the clock has erred in my favour, giving me more time. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

 Mr President, we will not be going ahead with the vote on the Brok-Gualtieri report this morning: we will do it during the Brussels sitting. We will do it then in order to give Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri time to negotiate the conditions for applying Article 136 with the European Council. We are doing so because, as Mr Leinen said, the European Parliament is also der Hüter der Verträge
 – the guardian of the Treaties – and because we want the euro to function with everyone involved and with everyone committed; in the end, Mr President, we want it to be effective. That is what we asked for. It is not about any dispute between the institutions. It is not about gaining power for Parliament. It is about the result – the mechanism resulting from this – being effective for the European public. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,

Madam President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is going to vote enthusiastically in favour of this report, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council on this agreement. Ladies and gentlemen, in the 1980s we coined the phrase ‘democratic deficit’. By this we meant that in the European Union decisions were taken only by the Council of Ministers, based on Commission proposals, and that Parliament was only consulted. Parliament has been battling since the 1980s, through the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, the Constitutional Treaty and the Treaty of Lisbon, to close that democratic deficit, and I believe that through the Treaty of Lisbon, with Parliament’s new powers and the participation of national parliaments, we have achieved that objective. We are adding to that achievement today through this citizens’ initiative, which in the work of the Convention was due to the sound cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament. I would like to recall the following names here today: Jürgen Meyer, our German Social Democrat colleague, and Alain Lamassoure, who were responsible for bringing this initiative to the plenary of the Convention and getting it approved. I therefore believe that we have completed the circle, Madam President. I believe that today, when we adopt this initiative, we will have signed the death warrant of the idea of a ‘democratic deficit’. Now it is up to us to act responsibly, ladies and gentlemen, and today we also have the opportunity to do so. By adopting the Union budget we will be fulfilling the role that is expected of us: as a responsible Parliament with codecision powers. Ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is a good day for Europe. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,

Madam President, I joined Parliament 18 years ago now. Then, the European Parliament was a consultative parliament. It was a parliament that did not have any powers. In this process over the past 18 years, we have seen Parliament change from a consultative parliament to a fully colegislative one. Our good friend, Francisco Lucas Pires, who witnessed this process, said that it changed from a deliberative parliament to a legislative parliament. Therefore, the text that we are going to adopt on Wednesday is the culmination of negotiations between the Commission and Parliament on the framework agreement. I confess that when I tell my family that I am going to Strasbourg to take part in the debate on the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission, I have to give them quite a lengthy explanation. This is because, obviously, these things do not exist in national parliaments or at national level, so people do not understand why an agreement has to be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to implement what the treaties say. However, it does have to be done. It has to be done for a very basic reason, which Mr Rangel and Mr Šefčovič have already stated: because we want to be efficient. What the framework agreement is essentially seeking to do is to resolve all the practical obstacles that could arise in terms of legislation, parliamentary control and codes of conduct. I therefore believe that it is a good blend of European democracy. It is ‘consensual’ democracy rather than the ‘conflictive’ democracy that we have in our countries. In consensual democracy, the intelligent thing to do is to find solutions to any problems that could arise. Therefore, the framework agreement is an instrument for preventing future problems and making what the treaties say a reality. As we have a new treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, it makes sense to implement it. I would like to congratulate Mr Rangel and the team that he led, and the European Commission, because I believe that they have reached a very reasonable agreement. When reading the content of the agreement, one cannot fail to be surprised at the voices being heard in some national parliaments questioning whether it poses a threat to the Council’s powers. For goodness’ sake! The Council is indeed the other colegislator. We do want to legislate, and we are legislating a great deal and successfully with the Council of Ministers. We are colegislators on an equal footing. We do not need to gain any sort of small advantage. What we want is for this to be effective, and I believe that the agreement is going to help to achieve this. Allow me to say, Mr Šefčovič, that you took the bull by the horns – a very bullfighting-related expression in my country – when you said that the interpretation of Articles 6 and 7 of the resolution is Parliament’s interpretation in relation to international agreements and international conferences. I do not believe there is anything strange here. What we are talking about here is Parliament being informed and participating through the Commission and through negotiation, nothing more. What is the purpose? The purpose is for us to know what the Commission has done when we have to adopt it here. Therefore – and I will finish here Madam President – congratulations to both of you. I believe that this is a good omen: as they would say in Casablanca, 
‘the beginning of a beautiful friendship’. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

Mr President, on 14 February 2008, as a Valentine’s gift, the Conference of Presidents decided that the intergroups would only meet on Thursdays. Since then, we have been trying to resolve this issue. We have not managed to do so. Now the intergroups have to meet on an unsuitable date. They almost never have rooms and they never have interpretation. I am speaking today not only as the Chair of the Intergroup on Poverty and Human Rights, but with a mandate from the majority of the intergroups in this House, and therefore from the Members of this House who are part of those intergroups. I formally ask the Conference of Presidents to reconsider and to revoke the decision of 14 February 2008, going back to the previous situation of giving freedom to the intergroups. If it does not do so, I would like to say respectfully that we will bring the matter to Parliament’s plenary session, which will decide who is sovereign in this House, which is Parliament. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

Mr President, Mr Leterme, I would congratulate you on your speech: it was an excellent presentation of this Presidency. I believe that we can already draw one, or even more than one, conclusion from this morning’s debate: firstly, that this House – those of us who want to build Europe, those of us who want to think positively about Europe – supports your Presidency and supports the efforts that you will be making. Furthermore, being aware of the difficulties within your government, I would like to thank you doubly, as it is all the more difficult for you to have come here today with this ambitious programme. We offer you our heartfelt thanks. Secondly, concentrate on resolving the economic issues. I believe that we have a great opportunity at the moment. I believe that we are on the point of reaching agreement on the issues relating to financial supervision. Concentrate on that. Thirdly, make the Trio work. I believe that the Trio of Presidencies is the great innovation of the Treaty of Lisbon. Let it not be a gimmick, let it be a reality, and let us do what the founding fathers said: think and act – in this case, Spaniards, Belgians and Hungarians – as Europeans. Thank you very much, Mr Leterme, and good luck! Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. 
– (ES)
 Madam President, I believe that there can only be two solutions for resolving the financial crisis that we have experienced: either we give more powers to national supervisors, or we create a European supervisor and give powers to it. I am glad, Madam President, that at this moment, Parliament is firmly committed, politically committed, to European supervision, and I believe that there is great consensus on this among all political groupings. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs will support, and has supported, all institutional measures that move in this direction. It seems to me at the moment, Madam President, that once this commitment becomes manifest tomorrow, the Commission has a first order function in negotiations with the Council. During these negotiations, it seems to me that the key point will be whether these European authorities will be able to deal with companies affected directly at national level if the national supervisor is not involved. Therefore, Commissioner, the best of luck with this task, which I believe to be a determining factor for the future of supervision and capital, at this time, for those of us who would like more Europe. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

Mr President, when you attended a meeting of the European Economic and Social Committee, Mr Van Rompuy, you used a beautiful image. You said that in the economic and financial crisis, we had wanted to build life rafts during the voyage. This was indeed the case, as the Economic and Financial Affairs Council that preceded the last European Council meeting took certain measures that were unthinkable in some countries, one of which I know very well. What we therefore need to do is ensure that this does not happen again in the future and therefore, that we build the life rafts in advance. I listened very carefully to what you said. You mentioned ‘a strict supervision of the national budgets’. I agree. Then, however, you added that there was no question whatsoever of the Commission supervising the national budgets before they were approved by the national parliaments. Well, I heard you say this to Commissioner Rehn. Moreover, I think it is a good idea and one that we should explore. ‘De l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace
’, as a French revolutionary would say. I have no problem at all, President Van Rompuy, with being under the protection of the European Union. I prefer to be under the protection of the European Union than under the protection of rulers whose method of government involves constantly changing course and improvising. We are therefore going to pursue any possibilities that we have. Secondly, it has been said here by some Members that as they are not in the euro, they do not care what happens to the euro. Well, I am concerned about what happens to the national currencies that are not in the euro, because that is being European. If, at any point, those currencies are in difficulties, it will concern me, because they will affect the economy that belongs to all of us. Mr President, one last aside. I know that, in times of crisis, it is more difficult to talk about fighting poverty, because there are fewer resources. I believe, however, that what has made us greater as Europeans is fighting against social exclusion and poverty. I ask that 2010, which is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, should not be simply one more conclusion of the European Council. President of the Commission, let us make active policies in this area. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

 Madam President, more than 20 years ago – in fact 23 years ago – I was fortunate enough to witness the signing of an agreement in the other parliament building between the then President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, and the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Marcelino Oreja, for what were then the European Communities to sign up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. That was 23 years ago. This reminds me of the answer that the poet Heinrich Heine gave when he was asked, ‘Where would you like to die?’ He replied, ‘In England, because there everything happens 100 years later’. Based on some speeches that we have heard, it seems that everything happens 200 years later, Madam President. I trust, however, that Mr Duff’s influence in the new Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition government will improve this situation. Therefore, Madam President, my Group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), has been in favour of this accession for a long time now, and we warmly welcome the excellent report by Mr Jáuregui. It is his first report and I am sure that it will not be his last. We are doing so because we feel that it will increase guarantees for the public, because what we are doing is giving more guarantees to people that the European Union legislation applied by the Member States and European Union laws is in line with the set of rights recognised in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. This report opens the way for resolving many of the technical legal problems that are going to arise, because we must not forget that the convention was designed to be ratified and applied by Member States. Whatever the propaganda from some sides of this House, the European Union is not a state or a super-state. It is an international organisation, and therefore, there are difficulties in adjusting an international organisation to something that was made for states. Mrs Giannakou, who was our shadow rapporteur and did an excellent job for which I sincerely thank her, will talk about the specific issues. All I want to do now is join Vice-President Reding in calling for the Council to give the Commission a mandate to negotiate swiftly, and I am sure that my friend, Mr López Garrido, will ensure that this is the case. This will mean, Madam President, that soon we will be able to celebrate the European Union signing up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, I would like to clarify two things. Firstly, the articles that are in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that are also in the European Convention on Human Rights are the same and mean the same thing: Articles 52 and 53 of the Charter; there is therefore no contradiction. Secondly, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights is supranational. Therefore, if someone wants to apply to it due to a European Union decision or the application of Union law, they will first have to apply to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling. I understand that Europhobes always want to vote against Europe, but at least out of parliamentary courtesy, they should read Mr Jáuregui’s report, which sets everything out clearly. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, please allow me to begin my speech with a line from Rilke: ‘Herr, es ist Zeit. Der Sommer war sehr groß...
’.
 Rilke was the favourite poet of our recently deceased fellow Member, Dimitris Tsatsos. Some time ago now, on 19 November 1997, Dimitris Tsatsos and I had the honour of submitting the report on the Treaty of Amsterdam to this House. It was in that very report on the Treaty of Amsterdam that we proposed that any amendment to Treaties be prepared beforehand by a Convention. We called that the Community method. Indeed, it is that Convention method that was used in preparing the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, above all, the Constitutional Treaty. I wish to remember Dimitris Tsatsos today in particular, as we are on the threshold of carrying out the first reform of the Treaty of Lisbon, which, in the last analysis, Mr President, is the Constitutional Treaty for which we fought so hard. That first reform, which is going to consist of the amendment of Protocol (No 36) of the Treaty of Lisbon, is caused by an anomaly because, at the time the elections to this Parliament were held in June last year, the Treaty of Lisbon had not come into force owing to the vicissitudes with which we are all familiar. Consequently, the last parliamentary elections were held under the Treaty of Nice, which was in force at that time, and said Treaty of Nice provides for the existence of 736 MEPs, as opposed to the 751 provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. To complicate matters even further, Mr President, the 1976 Act lays down that an MEP’s mandate lasts for five years. This means that we cannot now simply apply the number laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely the 751 MEPs, given that under Lisbon a certain country loses three Members who have been elected and, therefore, cannot leave Parliament during this parliamentary term. That, Mr President, is why Protocol (No 36) has to be amended in order to enable the Lisbon agreements to come into force, and why during this parliamentary term, 2009-2014, when the amendment of Protocol (No 36) comes into force, this Parliament will, exceptionally, have 754 Members. That is why, Mr President, the European Council addressed a letter to you asking that, in accordance with Article 48(2) of the Treaty, this Parliament give its opinion on two questions. The first question is whether or not a Convention is necessary in order to prepare the amendment to Protocol (No 36). The second is whether or not the Heads of State or Government can call an Intergovernmental Conference to amend Protocol (No 36). Both questions are linked, although they are dealt with in two different reports. I will begin with the calling of an Intergovernmental Conference. As I have said, we are dealing with the political result of applying the Treaty of Lisbon and we are also dealing with a transitional and exceptional solution that will only last for the duration of this parliamentary term. Therefore, that Intergovernmental Conference will confine itself to something that has already been agreed: how to distribute those 18 MEPs among 12 countries. Consequently, Mr President, there is no debate. I believe that the Intergovernmental Conference can be very quickly called and can even resolve the issue in a single morning, given that the political decision has already been taken. For that reason, I am going to ask for a ‘yes’ vote for an Intergovernmental Conference and say that I do not believe that a Convention is required for an issue that has already been resolved. We are in favour of holding the Intergovernmental Conference; we are against calling a Convention. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, when people coming from positions as different and far-removed as those of Mr Mauro, Mr Gollnisch and Mr Colman come to the conclusion that there are problems with the electoral procedure and systems for the election of MEPs to the European Parliament, it means that we need a uniform electoral procedure. That was a mandate that already existed in the Treaties of Rome. Therefore, we coordinators – and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them, most especially Mr Jáuregui and Mr Duff – have agreed on Amendment 2, which will be voted on tomorrow. I hope that this amendment will be supported by this House, particularly so that we can soon resolve this issue of a uniform electoral procedure for elections to the European Parliament. By means of this, we would, it seems to me, remove this type of question mark. In his speech, Mr Trzaskowski spoke about the necessary representativeness of this Parliament, something that the majority of the speakers and Vice-President Šefčovič, among others, have also highlighted. I agree. Indeed, we say as much in paragraph 1 of the report, to the extent that the 18 MEPs should enter en bloc
, otherwise we would lose representativeness. In order for them to enter en bloc
, in order to comply with this act of political justice that is the Treaty of Lisbon, we have to be practical, because a transitional and exceptional situation, ladies and gentlemen, also requires transitional and exceptional situations and solutions. This is why, and I am quite open about it, I do not like the possibility of MEPs joining this Parliament who were not elected in 2009, something which, by the way, I clearly state in paragraph 2 of the report. Nevertheless, if I have to choose between that and the 18 Members not taking their seats, or coming up with a practical solution and the 18 joining, meaning therefore that we comply with the Treaty of Lisbon, I ask this House, as I have already done in the report, to choose that solution; a transitional and pragmatic one but, above all, Madam President, a just one. I would like to thank everyone for their collaboration and for the interesting contributions that were made to this report. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, it was in this very House, almost seven years ago, at the end of the constitutional convention, when we Members of the European Parliament and members of the national parliaments succeeded in putting forward a proposal that was accepted by the Presidium. I had the honour of taking it to the Presidium and we approved it. Furthermore, I wish to recall here the names of Mr Lamassoure and Mr Mayer, because it was they who drew up the Citizens’ Initiative proposal, a popular initiative that is today incorporated into the treaties. A popular initiative that is an example of participatory democracy – Mr Šefčovič has explained this very well – and of European democracy, because the issues that need to be covered by this initiative must be European issues, not local issues. Participation by citizens, therefore, and issues dealt with at European level. Mr Šefčovič, who is preparing this proposal, has not told us what it involves. He has left us with our mouths watering. On behalf of my group, Mr Šefčovič, I would ask that it contain at least three ideas. Firstly, that it should be clear and simple. In other words, do not let us make things complicated. It must be something accessible to the people, so that they can participate without having had to have gone to university. Secondly, that it should provide for cooperation between the European authorities and the national authorities, because, in my opinion, the national authorities must play an important role in the way signatures are organised. Thirdly, that we should educate, through the European Commission and through Parliament, by explaining how this legislative initiative may be used to avoid disappointments. I will give you an example of this that I saw on the Internet. An online petition has already been launched to use the popular initiative to make it possible to change the seat of Parliament so that there is only one. Well, this is impossible and we must say so from the start; it calls for reform in the treaties and cannot be dealt with by the popular initiative. There is, therefore, a lot of educating to be done, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, and of Parliament, in an initiative that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) endorses and hopes may serve to promote the sense of belonging to the Union and public participation in the Union’s business. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, I had the same concern as that expressed by the rapporteur. I think that in order for the vote to proceed properly on Wednesday, in the case of such an important report, we need to know in advance which amendments you consider to be inadmissible. I therefore accept what you said, and we would like to have them tomorrow. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would like to return to the subject of the admissibility of amendments, which you referred to before. Pursuant to Rule 157(3), it is up to you, but I would ask you, Mr President, to take into account the wise words of the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Casini. I do not think it can be left in the hands of the Parliament’s services to determine which amendments relate to the Treaty of Lisbon and which do not. Moreover, this House has the sovereign right to decide whether or not an amendment is necessary, at this time when, as everyone has said, a new phase is beginning. Mr President, I would ask you, therefore, to use the considerable power granted to you under the Rules of Procedure in moderation, and with your usual prudence. May you make the right decision, and may we all see it. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, the President of the European Commission was saying that he congratulated Mr Reinfeldt on having brought the ship safely to harbour, the ship in question being the Treaty of Lisbon. Two years ago, in this House, I was saying that I was afraid that the Treaty of Lisbon might end up like the fish in The Old Man and the Sea,
 Hemingway’s novella, which, after a long battle, arrived at the harbour almost as a pile of bones. Well, I can see that the Treaty of Lisbon has not arrived at harbour as a pile of bones, but that its essence is still there. Thank you, Mr Reinfeldt; thank you, Cecilia. I must say, however, that I believe that what you have done, in seeking the agreement with the President of the Czech Republic, is right. Many of us in this House were troubled by the behaviour of the President of the Czech Republic, but there is a Spanish poet who says: ‘after everything, everything has been nothing’; in the end, the important thing is that the treaty is in force and that now we are thinking about the implementation of the treaty. Mr Barroso, it is not my intention either to give you any advice on how you ought to form your Commission, partly because I respect the autonomy and independence of the President of the Commission, who has received a substantial vote asking him to do this. When you present your college of Commissioners and the division of responsibilities, we will tell you whether we are for or against, but today, you have our full support. Neither do I intend to give any advice, clearly, to the President-in-Office of the Council, but, if you will permit me, I would like to point out to you something that happened during the work done on the constitutional treaty. In the first draft, which created the post of the President of the Council, there was a proposal that this Council President should be a prime minister who had been in office for at least two and a half years (as a joke, Mr Reinfeldt, we called it the ‘Bruton clause’, after John Bruton, because John told us that he had been prime minister for two years and seven months, and therefore would be eligible for the post). However, we later removed this condition – Mr Duff remembers – and we removed it because in this Parliament, we were asked what there was in the DNA of a prime minister that was not possessed by other mortals’ DNA. Why must the President of the Council be a prime minister? Mr Reinfeldt, you should rather seek out the person who can best represent moral authority, who can be the broker of agreements in Europe. In order to do this, we have given you a tool, Mr Reinfeldt: it is the fact that the election of this President of the Council does not have to be unanimous, but may be by qualified majority. Therefore, consensus is desirable, if it is possible; if not, use the qualified majority to seek out the best President of the Council. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).  
– Mr President, because the speaker was so kind as to agree to answer a question, I am going to ask one. Real Madrid, which is a Spanish football club, has got a flag and an anthem. Do you believe it is a state? (Laughter and applause) Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

– (ES) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us imagine that tonight, when this interminable debate finishes, we go out and we meet 27 fellow Members downstairs and we have to decide unanimously which restaurant we are going to. If we negotiate this obstacle, then imagine that the 27 of us have to choose the same thing to eat, and that the 27 of us also have to decide whether or not to have wine. Mr President, this metaphor, which comes from someone who is on a diet, provides a good illustration of the current situation of the European Union and what the Treaty of Lisbon brings in: in my view, it is the most important thing, namely eliminating the requirement for unanimity. If those of us who have spoken here all want the European Union to function properly, to be effective, to produce added value for the people, then the first thing that needs to be done is to replace the requirement for unanimity with a requirement for super-qualified majorities. That is the most significant achievement of the Treaty of Lisbon. Opposing the Treaty of Lisbon means not wanting Europe to function properly or to have an important role in the world. Mr President, I do not understand, and it is a source of regret for me, how some fellow Members who have freely entered this Parliament can have more confidence in the Council of Ministers than in the European Parliament. In addition, these are people who will never be in the Council of Ministers. Why do they believe that their interests are better defended by the Council of Ministers than by this Parliament, where they are present and where they can vote? Mr President, another thing I do not understand is why a certain fellow Member said that what they want is to take their country – and this is a legitimate view – out of the European Union. In that case, ladies and gentlemen, it is necessary to be in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon, because the Treaty of Lisbon establishes, for the first time, an exit clause. Now, in truth, it is necessary to have the courage and the ambition to say to their people that it is necessary to leave the European Union. That is also something that I would like to see. Mr President, to sum up, I believe that through the result of the Irish referendum we are completing the process. Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Rouček and Mr Brok – who are concerned by the attitude of the President of the Czech Republic – that I have no doubts. I have no doubts because a person who refused to sign what had been adopted by the Chambers that elected him, a person who refused to sign the Treaty, would be like the Queen of England refusing to sign a law from Westminster. That is not possible. I am also certain that someone as patriotic as Mr Klaus would not want to see his country engulfed in an internal constitutional crisis. Mr President, I therefore believe that the time has come to join forces, for us to realise that the world is not waiting for us, the Europeans, and that either we Europeans must unite and maintain constructive positions regarding the problems that our citizens are experiencing at the moment, or else Europe, as a power, will disappear from the map. Mr President, that is what I believe that we must now do, in unity, as Europeans and as Parliament. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, I believe that one of the conclusions of this debate is that when things are explained, when there is discussion with people, when there is communication, when lies are denied, then greater participation and greater backing for the European project are achieved. Therefore, I venture, along the lines of what many speakers have said, to make a positive, constructive contribution, and to ask the European Commission to consider whether, in the make-up of the new Commission, the duties of the Commissioner for Human Rights should not be included within a wider portfolio such as the Commissioner for Citizenship, to include communication, which is vitally necessary in order to be able to communicate well, to explain well, and to be able to begin a genuine dialogue on our European project.

 Mr President, the seriousness of the situation undoubtedly means that the forthcoming European Council to be held on 28 and 29 June will be perceived differently by Europeans, as a starting point in the efforts to build a new structure for the European Union. It cannot therefore simply involve the proposed freezing of a series of measures and initiatives that people do not understand. Instead, we need to be able to find sufficient symbols and unequivocal signs in this Council that a new era is dawning in the European Union. A plan needs to be decided upon, with a timetable and priorities, and, above all, short-term measures need to be as important as medium and long-term measures. We are all aware of the areas where action needs to be taken. The Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, has recently sent the President of the Council and the President of the Commission an action plan with five measures. What we wish to highlight, however, is the need for a new European structure that can bring an end to the instability and turbulence that we are currently experiencing. Jaime Mayor Oreja,

 Mr President, I shall not waste too much time describing the decision and procedures undertaken by the Argentine Government in its expropriation of YPF-Repsol. As I said yesterday, however, arbitrariness, legal uncertainty and illegitimacy are some of the terms that this decision merits. We are therefore facing a violation of rights and principles, appalling political and economic practice, and a worrying precedent, which means that this incident affects all Europeans. This is not, therefore, a dispute merely between Spain and Argentina. That is why today, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to stress what Europeans – the European institutions – can do, as well as why, what for and how, when this kind of decision is taken, which weakens the principles and, undoubtedly, the freedoms I have just mentioned, with the aim being that this type of action is never repeated. Allow me to express two ideas. The first is that in times and situations of crisis such as we are currently experiencing, the weaknesses of everyone, national governments and national institutions of the different countries, both inside and outside the EU, tend to increase; this is a reminder that the EU’s strength is its reason for being, and that the best instrument with which to alleviate the difficulties and weaknesses of the Member States should be the Union’s strength. That is the EU’s main purpose. My second idea is this: the crisis involves us all and is present in every European country; although it might appear momentarily that it is settling in one country or another, it is, in fact, our very model that is in crisis and, if it is not resolved, that crisis spreads slowly, gradually and systematically throughout all the countries. That is why one of the deep-rooted causes of this crisis is the EU’s lack of political ambition, and therefore the different manifestations of the crisis at hand should serve as opportunities so that the European voice can be clearly heard when this kind of injustice endangers the investments and future of the European institutions. I therefore welcome the determination shown by Mr Wammen, Mr Tajani, Baroness Ashton and Mr Barroso, who have proven that they are examining measures with which to tackle this situation. The more planned, strategic and organised measures we adopt, the greater and better our response will be to this crisis.

 Mr President, the climate crisis cannot be used as an argument to cover up an injustice of this kind. The fact that we are experiencing harmful climate change should in no way allow us to hide the injustices, arbitrariness and legal uncertainties that are taking place in a country such as Argentina. One day, we shall have the debate you want on climate change and – you are not really listening to me – on the crisis of values and principles that we are having in the EU and European countries. We can talk about climate change and the crisis of values whenever you like, but today we must address an injustice that is being carried out in Argentina, which is damaging European prospects and investments in the countries of that region. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

 Mr President, there is one principle that we should defend both inside and outside the European Union, and that is the principle of legal certainty. Arbitrariness is an aspect of this that we should be able to face up to and fight against, both inside and outside the European Union. When a decision is dominated by legal uncertainty and arbitrariness, that constitutes an unlawful action which affects thousands of small shareholders and which, most of all, sets a bad precedent for many European investments around the world. We therefore maintain that this debate is necessary and essential, not only for Spain and for a Spanish company, but also as a future reference for the many European investments made outside our borders. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE

 Madam President, the European Council has adopted a series of measures covering governance, budgetary rationalisation, competitiveness and so on and I must say that they are all along the right lines. The European Council’s 16 points are largely due to the work of President Van Rompuy and President Barroso, to whom I first of all offer my congratulations, because I do value – some of us do value – what you have done as leaders of the institutions. However, the problem is that not only are we going through a financial crisis, we are also experiencing a crisis of confidence and a political crisis in Europe and in the European nations. The problem is not simply one of assessing the actual economic and technical contents of the European Council. At the same time as there are meetings of the European Council, European, national and regional elections are being held and all of these confirm our apprehensions. Extreme positions are being adopted. Some of these positions are currently taking refuge in forms of nationalism. Therefore, you must be very well aware that our problem is not simply to face up to the crisis, but to face up to the political and social consequences of that crisis. It is not simply a time when there is, as a fellow Member quite rightly said, a north-south crisis in the European Union. These are new times and a particular feature of new times is that crises mount up and proliferate and are not resolved. They turn up unexpectedly, both inside and outside the EU. Moreover, these new times basically demand new ways of thinking at both individual and institutional levels, and that is the major political challenge that faces us. Any change in one’s personal way of thinking starts with that person him or herself. First of all, if that person is a Member of this House, he or she must say in what ways Parliament must change if it is to deal with new times. The same goes for members of the Commission and the Council; each and every one of us must be able to face up to this issue. However, in any case, the main thing is not to go off course, because you are heading in the right direction. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

Mr President, the attacks that have recently taken place in Iraq and Egypt are evidence of two tragedies for Europe, albeit of a different nature. Firstly, it is a tragedy that the events themselves have taken place, due to their cruelty and the loss of human life. Secondly, however, it is also a tragedy to see how too often they go unnoticed in our society. In many cases, the way in which we act means that these events are confined to the accident and crime reports in the media, as if they were something external rather than an attack against us. It is as if they were happening somewhere else when, in fact, these attacks are taking place at the heart of and against the core of our civilisation, our Europe. The role of the European institutions is, fundamentally, to raise awareness regarding the seriousness, the significance and the scope of the attacks against Christians in these places. The European institutions should not only issue generic statements condemning these attacks, but should also promote action along two lines: firstly, ensuring that this tragedy is more present in our societies and our media, and secondly, ensuring that the European institutions are more present where the tragedy is taking place. With this objective and with these two lines of action, allow me to say, Baroness Ashton, that the European institutions and you yourself must promote the important role of the victims of these events. The victims need to be given faces. The victims need to be present in our European institutions. We need to prepare a programme of visits, meetings and even material support for the victims, but it is the victims of this terrible persecution themselves who will do much better than we can to defend their cause. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE

Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, these first six months following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon required and merited a change in political attitude. If the economic and financial crisis has been a consequence of the move away from the ‘real’ economy and the disordered development of the ‘unreal’ economy, the same can be said in a political context. On 20 January, in this Parliament, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero announced the four – not two – priorities of his Presidency: first, the common market for energy; second, investment in the information society; third, a sustainable economy or industry, with a plan for developing an electric vehicle; fourth, the completion of the Bologna higher education area. I ask myself, to what extent does this statement of objectives approach the reality that we have lived through? During his first speech, when he put forward his objectives, he did not mention the words ‘deficit’ or ‘debt’ once. The entire Presidency changed radically at the Ecofin meeting on 9 and 10 May of this year, and the euro crisis came to light. He continued to be late and unsuccessful. Necessary measures had to be improvised in the European Union due to the lack of foresight and depth in the diagnosis of the crisis. There was an additional difficulty: because of the results of his economic policy, the person holding the rotating Presidency was not in a position to participate in the leadership required for a solution, as he had become part of the problem. While rotating presidencies are, without a doubt, different following the treaty, in such an acute situation of economic crisis, either they assert themselves, or else they are even more limited and weighed down by the lack of confidence in, and the lack of credibility of, their economic policies within their respective countries, as in this case. Mr President, the greatest crisis that we politicians are living through is that of confidence. A crisis of confidence of such magnitude can only be resolved if we dare to tell the truth. We can find a description of the third fiction of this Presidency within this morning’s speech, in which it seemed that the President was only interested in extolling this Presidency. The question that we must ask ourselves is whether we will be capable of not going back to improvising or, instead, whether we will be able to diagnose and foresee the specific crisis scenario that will have a social dimension. (Applause) Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I believe that the worst crisis that we could suffer is not only the one that we are currently suffering, but the one that we will suffer if we are not capable of learning the right political lessons regarding what is happening. We have been living beyond our means, especially in some countries. We have moved away from the real economy and embraced the fictional economy, in our public accounts and, at the same time, in our family and private lives. We have not been capable of understanding that, as is the case for any living organism, growing is not the same thing as getting fat. Growth requires effort and proportion, while the process of getting fat involves a lack of proportion and balance in comparison with the work that we do and the welfare that we enjoy. This crisis does not remain static. The picture of the crisis a few months ago was a different one, a completely different one, to the picture that we have today. The picture of the crisis in a few months is going to be a different one to the picture that we have today. This crisis was economic and financial, and will have a growing social dimension involving social conflict. This means that while we are in this phase, before the conflict becomes a social one, those of us involved in politics need to be aware that our main crisis is a crisis of confidence. It is not only a crisis of the euro. Let us analyse all the political and electoral processes in recent months. There is a crisis of confidence, and that means that what we need to ask ourselves is how we need to change, how our attitude needs to change: our political, institutional and personal attitude. In this respect, instead of thinking about other institutions, the question that Parliament needs to ask itself is what contribution it can make to a change of institutional and political attitude in this House. I dare say that today, having heard many reasons for the crisis – bureaucracy, agencies, governments – there are two issues on which we need to change. Firstly, Europe requires a minimum level of cohesion from Parliament: it cannot bleed itself dry in such a profound debate on two concepts of European society. Secondly, we need to dare to tell the truth about what is happening to us. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE

Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to express my wholehearted, firm and unreserved support to Mr Barroso. This is based not only on what he has said today, but also on speeches he has made in Parliament that have encouraged us to support him more strongly and significantly than ever. I would like to say that the main reason for that support is not the number of Commissioners that our Group, or our political family, has in the Commission, but rather it is fundamentally the belief that this is a unique and distinct time for the European Union. This Commission is not just any Commission and this Parliament is not just any Parliament, not only because of the Treaty of Lisbon, but also because we are experiencing a crisis that is unprecedented in the European Union: an economic and social crisis. We do not think that the Treaty of Lisbon is the most important thing. The most important thing is for there to be a change of attitude in terms of steering all the European institutions towards greater political ambition. We therefore unreservedly support the Commission led by Mr Barroso. We also support the Commission because, whilst we are currently experiencing an economic and financial crisis, we are going to move onto another phase: the social crisis. The differences between some countries and others are going to increase, and there is going to be increased social unrest. The economic and social crisis is undoubtedly going to cause increased social unrest. Another reason is that we are experiencing a crisis of values, making it essential that all of us, not just the Commission, change our personal attitudes. We all need to change our attitude. Our Group therefore believes that the best way to change, to transform and to improve is to support the European Commission led by Mr Barroso. I therefore think that in the context of this task, and of the work that we have to do, the PPE Group is the group that wants us all to change the most. The European Parliament also needs to change. The Commission alone cannot be held responsible for the frequent lack of unity in this House, which is largely the reason why there is no European voice in the world. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President of the Spanish Government, I would like to say to you that we are not living in just another period, we are not living in just any moment in and for the European Union. What you and Chair Daul said is true: the European Union and the European people know that their main concern is the crisis. It also needs to be pointed out here today, however, that before the economic crisis, in various elections in which there was a low turnout, Europeans were also showing signs of a growing disinterest and distance from the European institutions. Therefore, the crisis of values has manifested itself before and also during the European integration project. I want to say this to you because, in view of the obvious impetus which will be provided by the Treaty of Lisbon, we have our first opportunity to reduce this rift between the European people and the European institutions. We are therefore living – or at least we should be living – in a period of transition and of change, which you referred to. I would like to say, however, that the first challenge that we have ahead of us is to be able to find the turning point in the process of Europeans becoming distanced from European policy. Transitions are always an opportunity. They are also a risk, but I obviously encourage you to have a small number of clear ideas that can always be communicated to all Europeans. I would therefore like to say that a change in attitude in all the European institutions, in all of us and in the national governments and parliaments, in politicians, is undoubtedly much more important than the Treaty of Lisbon itself. It is not enough for the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force in order for us to be able to talk about transition and change in the European Union and ambition in the European project. I therefore want to say to you that the prime ambition is for Europeans to understand us better, as they do not understand us. Our language is unintelligible and, at times, incomprehensible, and we therefore have to know how to say that this is a problem in itself and a challenge in itself, so that we can move closer to the European people. We need to devote much more time, much more political energy and much more political impetus to ensuring that Europeans can understand us. Ladies and gentlemen, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, all the presidencies are going to be distinct, different and more demanding, and they are going to demand more sacrifice and more generosity from us than ever. I therefore would like to say that I am very pleased to say here today that the Spanish Partido Popular
 has supported the objectives of the Spanish Government in the European Presidency at such an important time for the European Union. What we need to do now is to apply them in the right way. I am going to tell you how the Spanish Presidency should not be measured. It is not going to be measured by the number of meetings that we hold. The measure of a good Presidency is not conventional speeches or great words, or common places. It will be measured by the results, the realities, our capacity to change our attitude – in all the European institutions – and our capacity to prioritise the real problems that Europeans have. This will be the only way that we will truly move closer to all Europeans. (Applause) Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commission President, I want to make a preliminary comment. We cannot have the same debate after elections as before elections, out of respect for the elections and for the European people. We should not do things any differently from what happens in the national parliaments in this respect. If the European Commissioners are the result of a majority in each country, our main concern should be that the Commission President is faithful to what the European people have voted for in the European elections, hence the importance and correctness of Mr Barroso becoming Commission President. This is a strictly democratic principle. There are two points which Mr Barroso made and which I do not have any doubts in clearly and definitively supporting. The first is the extent of the diagnosis of the current situation, which he gave in his speech and comments. We are not only experiencing an economic and financial crisis, but also a crisis of values. This is the first time that I have heard in this House any confirmation of these characteristics. We are not only experiencing a crisis, but also a changing world. That is why, more than ever before, the emphasis must be placed on positive action by individuals and on a change of attitude towards the State and the markets, because we have probably lived beyond our means in many EU countries. The second point, which I also support, is Mr Barroso’s European ambition. Europe needs to elect, prioritise and organise, and the crisis and the Treaty of Lisbon are the two main issues on which the Commission President must particularly concentrate. Tackling the crisis requires a determined Commission and also a Parliament which is capable of tackling the serious circumstances that we are experiencing. The crisis is not yet over and its landscape is still unrecognisable. It is also forcing us to deal with social inequalities in the European Union. We therefore need the political ambition that you have shown this afternoon, Mr Barroso. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again the horrific images from the Middle East have shaken us all. More than 35 children were among the 140 victims in the Gaza Strip; six people have been executed as alleged Israeli collaborators; a number of Israeli citizens have also killed by hundreds of rockets made in Iran; there has been an attack against civilians today in Tel Aviv; 45 000 reserve troops have been mobilised; and a ceasefire seems to have been confirmed, or so Mr Cohn-Bendit has just told me, after frantic diplomatic activity: mediation by the President of Egypt; phone calls by the President of the United States; visit to the region by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and US Secretary of State; involvement of the Arab League ministers; French-Qatari plan; and threat of a resolution on Syria in the United Nations Security Council. Of course, Mr President, in this case words are not enough as the situation is so serious. There is a great deal of impotence and frustration after the trite condemnation of the Council of Ministers the day before yesterday, and I believe that the most important thing is to achieve, and consolidate, a ceasefire that is guaranteed by the United Nations, and that protects the civilian population and supports the moderates. We saw the alternative, Mr President, in 2008: 1 400 victims. We are only too aware that the circumstances are not the best: fragmentation and division within the Palestinian cause, elections in Israel in January and, of course, a nuclear escalation in Iran. Therefore, President-in-Office of the Council, what Europe must do is support unreservedly this ceasefire to prevent the worst from happening. However, we must not fool ourselves, Mr President, into thinking that there can be stability in the area, stability in the region, unless we tackle the deep-seated causes and injustices that are fuelling the hatred and violence in that troubled part of the Middle East. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

– (ES) 
Mr President, when the negotiating guidelines were adopted, the European Union – its 27 Member States, the Commission and this Parliament – had a commitment from Israel dating back to 2005.  Israel is a partner of the European Union and an essential participant in the peace process, even if we dislike the decisions that have been taken with regard to settlements and in spite of the fact that some of the decisions taken by the Israeli Government undeniably violate the rights of the Palestinian people.  After the elections in the United States, the peace process negotiations will be revived, and it is clear that the European Union cannot be excluded from this process. The European Union and this Parliament therefore need to honour their commitments and adopt this agreement.  Mr President, the interpretative amendment that has been tabled to the draft legislative resolution is clearly in violation of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, as Rule 83 states quite clearly that no amendments may be tabled to a draft legislative resolution.  Parliament is entitled to express its opinion through non-legislative resolutions and, in any case, the acceptance of this amendment sets a worrying precedent, which, if this decision is not reversed, is likely to be the subject of an appeal before the Court of Justice, leaving those who tabled and accepted the amendment in a sticky situation. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
).  
– (ES)
 Mr President, I would like to make a clarification concerning the oral amendment presented by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Normally, my group strictly fulfils the commitments that it signs at the negotiating table, and the terms of negotiation, Mr President, state that the European Union will take appropriate and responsible measures. Clearly, included in those measures are humanitarian measures, as was reflected in the debate that we had with Baroness Ashton the other day, concerning the situation in Syria. Therefore, the addition of this word is superfluous because it is already included in the terms. Mr President, my group is opposed to the inclusion of this word. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Brok, on this report on the state of the common foreign and security policy, which cannot be separated from the times that the EU is living in with regard to the debt crisis, the euro crisis and the crisis in European integration. Baroness Ashton, as a bloc we may be the leading global importer of goods and services, we may be the leading global exporter of goods and services, and we may be the leading donor of humanitarian aid, tripling the aid donated by the United States, but what credibility do we have on the international stage, despite your efforts and our own, if we are not capable of solving internal problems with due care and in an effective manner? The new European External Action Service and the new common foreign and security policy have come into being at the most complex time and in the deepest crisis the EU has experienced since it was founded. It is clear that if we want to have a coherent, visible and effective common foreign and security policy, we need to try to answer the questions raised by Mr Brok in his introduction. How do we defend human rights in an international community that considers our Charter of Fundamental Rights to be a westernised view of the world? How do we reconcile the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, laid down in the United Nations Charter, with the principle of the responsibility to protect in order to prevent crises such as that in Syria, which you, Baroness Ashton, said appalled you? How do we identify new partners in line with our world view and how do we work with them, and how do we meet the challenges raised by the Northern and Southern Neighbourhood Policy? It is a difficult task, Baroness Ashton, to solve our external problems, and that is not your responsibility alone, as we will see tomorrow in the debate on the state of the Union. We must start by doing our work internally. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (ES)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, in the previous debate, Baroness Ashton said that you were appalled by the situation in Syria, and I think we have run out of words to describe it, as has been said in other debates. Indignation, frustration, impotence, and meanwhile, the bloodbath continues in Syria. We should look at events, too: Kofi Annan’s resignation in a plan that was doomed to failure from the very beginning. And statements, so many statements: a statement by the new Special Envoy, saying that this is an almost impossible mission, which makes me wonder why he accepted it; a statement by the minister of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, saying that new sanctions are to be imposed on Syria; statements by the Swedish minister, saying that he does not believe sanctions are going to have any impact; statements by the French minister, saying that we need to put more pressure on Syria. In short, a lot of words and not much action. As you rightly said, Baroness Ashton, the situation is continuing as it has done for months, but with even more deaths. The regime is sheltering behind the complicity of Russia and China in the United Nations Security Council, and the opposition is winning support across the regional sphere, hoping that sooner or later, there will be international intervention. In the meantime, Baroness Ashton, I believe the time has come for the EU and regional actors to make a decision. I would like to ask you to answer some specific questions. Do you agree with the statement made by the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, who said the time has come to do something if the Security Council does not make any progress? Do you believe it is viable to establish humanitarian corridors? Do you think it is possible to establish a no-fly zone? Do you believe it is desirable and advisable to arm, support and help the opposition? Baroness Ashton, more than 20 000 dead people are looking to us, and we have to turn our words into actions. You have done a very good job of providing humanitarian aid, and continue to do so, but our purpose is not to be an International Red Cross. We want to have political leverage, with other actors, in order to stop this carnage. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, despite the financial crisis, I do not think we should forget that the European integration project is based on values: peace, understanding, harmony, reconciliation and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are part of the genetic code of the European Union. Not only are they part of the genetic code of the European Union, but they are also laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Among the institutions, surely Parliament is the one that is most committed to defending rights and fundamental freedoms and has a total and permanent commitment to the cause of human rights, which must not just apply to one region, country or continent, but which must be of a global or universal nature. Parliament has therefore given a Vice-President the responsibility for monitoring human rights; it has a body, which is the Subcommittee on Human Rights, as part of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET); it has created a new working group on democracy and electoral observation and there is always a section in its order of business dedicated to resolutions to defend human rights. Obviously, Parliament has distinguished itself by awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, which, as you know, was founded by a person who left a legacy promoting peace, respect, tolerance and peoples living together peacefully. Madam President, in this context, I am delighted to present this report which, in the form of recommendations, discusses the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights, and I would like to thank members of my political group for the prior work they have done and also thank the other political groups for their work and support. An important aspect, Baroness Ashton, is the mandate of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights. The representative must work to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, international justice and humanitarian law; to promote the abolition of the death penalty; and in all areas aimed at defending the causes of human rights’ defenders, fighting torture and impunity, defending women’s rights, child protection and the rights of minors, peace and security and, of course, the rejection of all forms of discrimination. The EU Special Representative must work very directly with Parliament and other international bodies, and must work in a context of visibility, flexibility and coherence with the historical aspects that I mentioned at the start of my speech, Madam President. The representative must be a person of broad experience, proven ability, international prestige and, of course, sufficient professional experience in the field of human rights. Obviously, Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Parliament does not seek to hijack the decision-making process for appointing this person, as it is up to the High Representative to make the proposal to the Council. However, in this context, I would like to highlight the particular importance of this appointment and the desire that, based on the trust and the mandate represented by the resolution that Parliament is going to adopt, you make the right appointment. This person is going to have a huge profile in defending this cause which, as I said, Parliament sees as a total and permanent commitment to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank some of my fellow Members for the work they did in advance to prepare this report and, of course, all those who have spoken in this debate. I note with satisfaction, Baroness Ashton, your firm commitment to ensuring that the EU Special Representative has a link with and works permanently and continuously with Parliament. Beyond the terms of the mandate, on which we have spoken extensively during this debate, and which, in my opinion, should also be applied to the interpretation of the democratic clause that we have with some third countries, there remains the question of the personal profile of the candidate. I was personally very pleased by the speech made by Mr Mitchell regarding the profile that this person should have, which brings to mind the anecdote sometimes told about when, in fourth century Athens, after the age of Pericles, Aristotle was walking with his pupils of the Peripatetic School and one of them made an observation that displeased his teacher. When Aristotle answered, the pupil said to him, ‘that is not my observation, but that of your teacher Plato’. Aristotle’s response has been repeated numerous times on the European stage from the fourth century BC to the present day and our technological and Internet era: ‘Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is the truth’. I believe that the Special Representative must be an integral part of the institutional structure of the European Union, report to the High Representative, have a link to Parliament and the Member States, but that what must be more dear to him or her must be the cause of defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, so that human rights and fundamental freedoms, as Parliament wishes, can take hold in the 21st century across the world.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus on the case of Syria. We have run out of adjectives to describe the deterioration of the situation there and the growing number of victims, including executed women and children. The words that best describe the way the international community feels are indignation and, of course, a feeling of frustration and powerlessness. It is clear that Kofi Annan’s plan has failed spectacularly and that we will need to think about other options. Keeping a minute’s silence – as occurred recently at the United Nations – and applying economic sanctions are hardly ways to overcome this situation. The Secretary General of the United Nations has said quite clearly that the President of Syria has entirely lost his legitimacy and that we cannot become accustomed to massacres being a daily occurrence. This situation and this conflict are dragging on too long, in my view, with the complicity, in particular, of a permanent member of the Security Council and of the Iranian regime. Baroness Ashton, a moment ago in this House, we had an extensive debate on the European Union’s role in defending rights and fundamental freedoms in the EU. Above and beyond our presence in the various contact groups, which is entirely justified, the EU has an obligation to put forward initiatives to bring an end to this situation and prevent the President of Syria from continuing to buy more time and massacring the opposition. It is also clear that the Syrian National Council must cooperate, and we hope that its new president, elected in Istanbul the other day, can unite the internal and external opposition. However, given the failure of diplomatic measures, there are not many options left open: humanitarian intervention, which is currently not possible due to the vetoes by Russia and China in the Security Council; political agreements with President al-Assad, which are continuing to result in him buying more time and cruelly repressing the opposition; or other mechanisms that would ultimately result in a civil war being sparked, which is already practically the case. Experience in neighbouring countries has shown us that, in order to try to bring an end to this situation in the short term, we need to seek political solutions to transfer power in the medium term. In this context, this solution is very difficult without a military presence and international troops. These are my questions, Baroness Ashton: do you ultimately think it will be possible to provide a military presence in order to try to respond and stop the dreadful conflict currently taking place in Syria? Who would be responsible for supplying those troops? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s debate in the House and the resolution that will be adopted afterwards, we wanted to highlight the importance of this association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine for the country’s European prospects, and as we have been reminded in this debate, a key element of the agreement is the democracy clause on respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, and respect for the rules of the democratic game. It is clear that the trial, conviction and humanitarian situation of Yulia Tymoshenko and of others blatantly violate the spirit and letter of this democratic clause. Parliament therefore must show its solidarity with these people, request that their rights be fully respected, strongly condemn the use of force, as has been observed, and, of course, ensure that opposition leaders can stand in the next elections, many of whom are currently in jail, like Yulia Tymoshenko. For that reason, I agree with what the Commissioner, Mr Füle said, in the sense that the signing of the association agreement cannot occur under these circumstances, and therefore, Parliament should not go ahead and ratify it. Secondly, without questioning the hosting of the European Football Championships, which is being organised jointly with Poland, I believe, and I am addressing you, Commissioner, that the European Union should try to give a joint response, given that we are supposed to be trying to establish a common foreign and security policy, as such that the representatives of the European Union and the Member States can act in a homogenous, joint manner from a shared standpoint.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we are debating an agreement between the European Union and Peru and Colombia, and speaking of human rights, Mr President, I would like Parliament to condemn the assassination of 12 members of the Colombian armed forces yesterday at the hands of the FARC terrorist organisation, 150 metres from the Venezuelan border. And I think, Mr President, that Parliament should convey its condemnation, warmth and solidarity to Colombian society as a whole and the victims’ families during these difficult times. The Commission has made it abundantly clear, Mr President, that we should not emphasise an ongoing dynamic of demands that has not been imposed on other countries that have signed up to agreements of this type. I think we should place emphasis on the fact that this agreement is a clear and predictable framework to try to overcome a regime of unilateral concessions, which I want to remind my colleagues already exists, is in force, and is going to affect trade, investments and services. And in this context, I am greatly surprised that many Members in this House state that they have doubts about this agreement, but that they do not have doubts about the human rights situation in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras or Nicaragua, with which the European Union has reached the same type of agreement, or in Mexico, where we all know about the rates of violence. What is true, Mr President, is that this agreement is going to put Peru and Colombia on an equal footing with other countries that benefit from the same facilities, as is clearly the case with Chile, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, Israel and the CARICOM nations. I believe, Mr President, that the European Union, its 27 Member States, the Commission, Peru and Colombia have signed this agreement, and I believe that we are falling into the trap of a paternalism exercise if we tell our partner countries what is good for them or what is no longer good for them. I think they are mature enough to know that they want this agreement because the European Union is a useful partner. And I believe, Mr President, that instead of considering introducing discriminatory and additional measures, what we have to do is to find out why, after almost two and a half years, Commissioner, this agreement has not yet been ratified. I do not think this situation paints the European Union in a good light and that, on the contrary, we should swiftly ratify it. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Mr President, I think we should congratulate ourselves on having made the decision to hold a debate and adopt a resolution. However, bearing in mind that Baroness Ashton will not be present in Parliament tomorrow due to a commitment she has with NATO defence ministers, I believe it would be appropriate to alter the agenda so that we could hear her speak, because she intends to make a statement on that very issue. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Howitt concerns human rights, including political, social and economic rights. That is why I should particularly like to thank you, Baroness Ashton, for the statement you made on the situation that has arisen in the Repsol company before we began our debate on this report. You said a great deal in a short time. You mentioned a wrong decision; a threat to investments and the future of Argentina; the need to comply with the commitments that were made; the measures you took to include this issue on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council; the postponement of the meeting of the EU-Argentina Joint Cooperation Committee; as well as analysing possible measures. With regard to Mr Howitt’s report, Madam President, I believe it is a reasonable report in general terms, although clearly some matters still need to be addressed, such as the decision to send a fact-finding mission to Gaza – which is a request that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) obviously cannot accept, as the rapporteur is well aware – and Mr Howitt’s position on Colombia, which is quite simply delusional. That amendment was already rejected in the vote taken in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and, for us, at a time when we are waiting for the Multipart Trade Agreement between Peru, Colombia and the European Union to be ratified, it is unacceptable. Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to highlight a fundamental aspect of our human rights policy, one with which Parliament has an irrevocable and unquestionable commitment. I am referring to the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. Parliament will vote on this issue in a resolution, and we would like the selection procedure for this individual to be objective, Baroness Ashton, so that the person appointed can truly have the merit and capability to fulfil this important role to the high level it certainly deserves.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, a threefold game is currently being played out in Syria. Several things are being determined: the influence that Iran and Saudi Arabia will have; the role that Egypt is going to play in the context of the Arab Spring; and the vacuum created by the election campaign in the United States, which China and Russia would both like to fill. The apparent good news is the unanimous adoption of this resolution in the United Nations Security Council. The important thing here, Mr President, is that the adoption of this resolution should be consistent with the attitude of those countries as regards the situation that has arisen in Syria. The path of diplomacy is slow to produce results, and meanwhile, Mr al-Assad is gaining time in order to continue repressing the population. The truth, Baroness Ashton, is that although we need to support Mr Annan’s plan, we are sending out mixed signals to the international community. On the one hand, Mr al-Assad remains in power, gaining time – for he knows that the veto by China and Russia enables him to massacre his population with impunity – and, on the other hand, we are sending out a message to dissidents that there is no short-term solution. It is therefore important, Mr President, that we should take all these factors into consideration; the EU deserves recognition for the action it has taken on humanitarian aid, the mobilisation of funds with Ms Georgieva, which you just mentioned, and its continued support for the deployment of this mission. However, as a diplomat from my country pointed out – and rightly so, I believe – according to the basis of Mr Annan’s plan, the solution to the conflict unfortunately has to begin with Mr al-Assad, but it also has to end with his removal.

 On behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we want to declare that our vote on the resolution on the European integration process of Kosovo is based on the fact that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it was a normal independent state, recognised by the international community, and does not take into account that the status of this territory continues to be controversial. It has yet to be recognised by a majority of countries, five of which are Member States of the European Union, including Spain. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, in the interests of achieving the broadest consensus possible, we believe that this resolution should receive wide support from this House, and so we propose an oral amendment to Amendment 5, in agreement with Mr Swoboda, Mr Verhofstadt and the other political groups. In the English version, this oral amendment consists of adding the words ‘strengthening and implementation’ after the word ‘introduction’, and the replacement of the word ‘condemns’ by the word ‘deplores’.

 Mr President, Mr Søvndal, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate on Russia is of great concern to us and forces us to choose between what is desirable and what is possible. The resolution that Parliament will have to vote on tomorrow addresses the very specific set of circumstances that have followed the presidential elections. We are faced with an official Russia which still harks back to the era of the Soviet Union and which feels entitled to veto freedom within the United Nations Security Council. This is a Russia where the President and the Prime Minister shamelessly take turns to be in power. A Russia where elections are not held in compliance with international standards, and a Russia where opposition figures are detained, which takes us back to the recent and far from glorious past. However, Mr President, this is also a Russia which is a member of the Council of Europe and of the World Trade Organisation, which duly collaborates with the OECD and wishes to become one of its members, and a Russia where, as in the Arab Spring countries, there are men and women who are fighting for their freedom and dignity. Mr President, I think what is central to this resolution is to work for change and to open a space for dialogue and conversation with the opposition whose rights have been infringed and ignored. We should leave until later, until Mr Swoboda’s report, the issue of the institutional framework, the new association agreement between the European Union and Russia, two entities that need to come to an understanding. Mr President, I think that from the viewpoint of the European Union – I would like to appeal to the President-in-Office of the Council and to the Commission’s representative – that we should mobilise all our efforts and influence to make what is desirable become possible, so that fundamental freedoms and the rights of all will soon become a reality throughout Russia.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, surely the deterioration of the political situation in Belarus, the problem of the political prisoners and the crisis that has arisen in relation to the EU ambassadors, which was analysed by the Foreign Affairs Council last Saturday, require that Parliament hold a debate on this issue. Therefore, Mr President, we call for a statement by the High Representative or, if she cannot be present, by the President-in-Office and, of course, by the Commissioner for Neighbourhood Policy and for a debate to take place. Accordingly, Mr President, we ask that, on the basis of this statement, this matter be included in the agenda, together with a debate and a resolution. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are three independent and developing factors affecting the Syrian crisis. Firstly, a kind of cold war between Saudi Arabia and, currently, Iran, which is becoming apparent on several fronts, and specifically in Syria at the moment, then, what is clearly a domino effect from the so-called ‘Arab Spring’, and finally, a greater desire on the part of China and Russia and other players in the Middle East conflict to make their presence felt and to fill the vacuum left by the European Union and the United States. We have followed the High Representative’s actions with a great deal of interest: suspension of development aid, humanitarian help, a contingency plan, the tightening of sanctions at the next Council of Ministers on 27 February, and support to the Arab League initiative. A more effective and coordinated diplomatic response from the Member States of the European Union was lacking, however. Unfortunately, none of those decisions has led to a short-term reduction in the intolerable violence that is being suffered by the Syrian people, hence the frustration we all share. The French Foreign Minister expressed that view today during an appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, in relation to the failure of the initiative and the Russian and Chinese vetoes in the United Nations Security Council. An initiative from Qatar and Saudi Arabia is being debated in the General Assembly as we speak, with the specific aim of ratifying the agreement, even though we know that it does not have any binding effects. What can we do about this situation? Increase the pressure on Russia and China, certainly. Two very appropriate occasions for doing so have arisen recently: one was the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of China to the United States, where he was received with full honours, and, of course, the EU-China Summit that has just taken place. It is also clear that we have to strengthen our relationship with the Syrian dissidents, and we have to see how this humanitarian corridor they have requested can be established and developed. In addition, it is clear is that the questions the Foreign Ministers of the Arab League asked themselves the other day also apply to us. How long are we going to remain impassive towards the violence that the Syrian people are currently suffering? Also, what is our tolerance limit when deadline after deadline passes, initiatives come and go, and the regime continues butchering the Syrian people? It is my belief, Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Secretary-General of the European External Action Service, that this is the key issue to be considered in today’s debate.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to bring up the matter of the El Universo
 newspaper in Ecuador. The facts are well known. The President of the Republic of Ecuador has brought criminal proceedings against the journalist, the newspaper and its owners because of the opinion that was expressed. The proceedings have led to a three-year sentence, given by two courts, and a fine of USD 40 million, which presents a serious threat to the newspaper’s very survival. A number of organisations have made reference to this matter, such as Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, and other international media and organisations working in the field of human rights. My question, Baroness Ashton, is very simple: are you aware of these facts? What is your opinion on the matter? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (ES) 
Mr President, as you are aware, Baroness Ashton, Ecuador is linked to the EU by a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement, which is based on the democratic clause and respect for fundamental rights, one of which is the right to freedom of expression. As you rightly said, on 10 February the Supreme Court will give its verdict on the appeal for this case; President Correa has said that he would be prepared to withdraw the court action if he is issued an apology. In addition to the concern you have expressed for freedom of expression in Ecuador, what would you be prepared to do in order to find a balanced, fair solution that respects the principle of freedom of expression?

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, on 23 January the Council took a difficult but consistent decision, and for that I congratulate Baroness Ashton. This Parliament will support the Council conclusions in the resolution we will vote on tomorrow. As you have just explained, it was difficult because it required sacrifices by several Member States, and it was consistent because it is in keeping with the positions we have defended so far. Both the President of France and the Prime Ministers of France and the United Kingdom have said that they will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. However, as well as being consistent, these measures need to be effective in order to promote the path of dialogue, bring Iran back to the negotiating table, ensure its full cooperation with the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and also, Baroness Ashton, to silence the drums of war that can be heard. Israel has said that all options are being considered, and one Republican candidate in the United States has said that swift action should be taken. Furthermore, some Iranian ministers have said that these sanctions will be ineffective, because the EU needs Iranian crude oil more that Iran needs the EU’s resources. What is more, the threat to close the Strait of Hormuz and the risk of escalating tension in the region could have serious repercussions for oil prices and further complicate the difficult economic situation we are going through. That is why, Baroness Ashton, I would like to say to you that, beyond the internal dimension and the consistency that were shown in the Council decisions of 23 January, it is also important to take action with our allies at this stage as regards our external scope and influence. You just told us that you visited India; the stance taken by India, Japan and other countries is vital to ensure that the measures adopted can have the effect that many of us are hoping for.

 Mr President, High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as Baroness Ashton has said, the situation in Syria is getting worse by the day, with an extremely high toll in terms of human life. You mentioned the figures released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: more than 4 000 people, of whom 1 000 are members of the security forces, and this augurs a bloody civil war in the country. Statements of condemnation have come from all sides – the United States, the European Council, the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union. However, Baroness Ashton, I believe that the time has come to move from words to action, because condemnation alone will not bring a halt to this situation. On the economic side, what can we do? You got it right, Baroness Ashton: implement the economic sanctions we have introduced, stop Syrian oil imports to the European Union and support the decisions of the Arab League and Turkey. On the political front, we should firstly support the deployment of ground forces requested by the Arab League. Secondly, we should strengthen relations with the Syrian National Council. I would also like to ask your opinion, Baroness Ashton, on the French initiative to create a humanitarian corridor protected by international troops. Lastly, we should obtain a more solid resolution from the United Nations, overcoming the reticence of some permanent members of the Security Council, such as China and Russia, whose position is absolutely unjustifiable, continuing in the vein of Resolutions 1970 and 1973, which, in the case of Libya, made it possible to put an end to a government’s criminal violence against its own people. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the next EU-US summit will be determined by the economic and financial crisis. I believe that both parties should adopt a modest approach and apply that Chinese proverb that, before launching ourselves into the task of putting the world to rights, we should first take a look at our own house. This means weighing up the global influence of each party and highlighting the role and the economic, commercial, financial and industrial weight of the European Union. Beyond the economic and financial problems, I believe that it is important to consider the lessons learned in Libya, after Operation Unified Protector, where the European Union was criticised. We should also consider the situation in Syria, after today’s meeting of the Arab League and try to move forward the search for a resolution in the Security Council of the United Nations. Then there is the peace process in the Middle East, which the Commissioner referred to, and the Palestinian question, in which the European Union gave a pitiful performance at the vote in UNESCO. We should also ask for greater consistency between words and deeds after the speech of President Obama in the United States. It is clear, Madam President, that the European Union and the United States are two partners who have a shared vision of the world, and although this is not always identical, they have a duty to understand and respect each other. Therefore it must be accepted that in today’s globalised world, in the face of challenges and threats that affect us all equally – whether it is the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime, the economic and financial crisis or unemployment, protecting the environment and natural resources or emigration – we must search for responses to all of these equally. It must also be accepted that unilateralism, even for the most prosperous and the most powerful, is an impossible dream. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, a balanced approach to the problem should be based on three premises: the State of Israel’s legitimate desire for security, the frustration of the Palestinian people and the blockage in the peace process. All of this, Baroness Ashton, comes at a time when international attention is focused on the Arab Spring, at a time when the United States is hampered by its electoral commitments, at a time when the government of Israel is divided and has almost no room for manoeuvre and when Palestinian radicals are increasingly showing their pleasure with the lack of results. Given this situation, Baroness Ashton, the question is very simple: what can we do as the European Union? In this context, I would like to tell you that Parliament, which has criticised you so many times – and I have been the first to do so – must acknowledge your efforts to seek solutions in Cairo, Ramallah, Jerusalem, New York and Washington, and your calls for the European Union to speak with one voice. In politics, Madam President, whatever is impossible is wrong. In the face of the United States’ announced veto in the Security Council, the President of France, as in the Georgia crisis in 2008 and this year in Libya, has proposed a compromise solution, which is the Vatican solution. Baroness Ashton, what view should we take of this initiative? Do you think it can be supported by the Member States? What can the European Union do to make the Quartet’s solution acceptable to the Palestinians? Madam President, if the European Union wants to be relevant and not decline in significance on the international stage, it must take a step forwards. It must move in the right direction and rouse itself from its lethargy. I am not saying this because of you, Baroness Ashton. You have done a lot and you have done it well, but you must propose solutions that are concrete, tangible, with defined costs and a precise timetable. You need to do this – and this is the hard part – without impinging on or harming the dignity of either side, while also recognising the inalienable rights that will enable one side to live in peace and security and the others to form their own state.

 Madam President, Commissioner, if we consider that a 42-year dictatorship has been brought to an end within a period of six months, in theory that could sound like a relatively short time frame. However, if we take this into account and consider it in the context of the human lives lost, the suffering caused and the setback this will bring for generations to come, then I think our assessment will be significantly different. In any event, everything remains to be done now that Muammar Gaddafi’s regime has fallen: provide humanitarian aid; guarantee security; establish order and control along the borders; bring about economic reconstruction, as well as a process of transition under extremely difficult circumstances; and ensure that there is no impunity for crimes committed. The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Dowgielewicz, has just said – and I agree with his assessment – that, within the framework of both NATO and the European Union, this despicable regime has been done away with thanks, in particular, to the action taken by specific Member States – such as France and the United Kingdom – and thanks to the determination and courage shown by the Libyan people. We should also acknowledge that the European Union, after some early wavering and remaining within the scope of its powers, acted swiftly and properly. It is true, as well, that Parliament was the first authority to call for the recognition of the National Transitional Council (NTC), thanks – if truth be told – to an invitation by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. It should also be noted that France was the first country to recognise the NTC. We have EUR 154 million in humanitarian aid, and a newly opened EU Office in Benghazi and Tripoli, which should quickly be upgraded to delegation status and for which a head of delegation with auctoritas
 should be appointed as soon as possible in order to tackle the important task of coordinating EU action with the Member States, and also with the Office that the Secretary General of the United Nations requested from the United Nations Security Council. Madam President, Mr Dowgielewicz, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, just three days ago in this Parliament we, like many others around the globe, commemorated the tenth anniversary of the vicious terrorist attack on the Twin Towers. The EU must make the Arab Spring one of its absolute priorities for two reasons: firstly, in order to live up to that cry for freedom and dignity that is spreading through North Africa and the Arab nations; and secondly, to prevent radical Islamic fundamentalism from taking root in the societies around us and interrupting the process of transition that is under way in those countries and, above all, to prevent freedom from being threatened once again by barbarity and fanaticism. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Secretary-General, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the interest we have been taking in the Arab Spring, as shown by the debate we have just had on Libya and Syria, should not distract our attention away from the situation in the Middle East and, in particular, from the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. This issue can be approached from an outside perspective – any implications that the outcome of the General Assembly might have on the peace process, and any change to the status quo, count a great deal – and from the perspective of the internal dimension of the EU. With regard to the external perspective, the peace process is in deadlock, as Mr Dowgielewicz has just told us. We are seeing increased tension in the region – the most tangible evidence of that was the attack on the Israeli embassy in Egypt – and also very particular circumstances for the United States government. President Obama is going to have difficulty meeting the proposals he set out in his inaugural speech in Cairo, because of the situation within the United States and also as a result of the electoral process he will soon have to face. Mr President, in politics anything that is not possible is false; without wishing to prejudge the substance of the resolution that is going to be adopted, I believe that we should start getting ready to adopt a draft resolution that improves the status of Palestine within the United Nations. This leads me on to the internal dimension of this issue: it is vital that the EU can express itself in a united voice on this sensitive point. Our past experiences in the United Nations have not been glorious. To be sure, we have shifted position in light of the new mechanisms established by the Treaty of Lisbon, and I believe that we need to focus all our efforts on three objectives: the peace process must move forward, and the status quo of a lack of negotiations must end; the chances to move forward on this issue must not be compromised or endangered; and the dignity of both parties in this conflict must be respected. Mr President, on this point I feel that the EU’s greatest strength is its union, and its greatest weakness is its division. I would therefore ask Mr Dowgielewicz – I realise, of course, that the Commissioner and Baroness Ashton are doing all they can on the matter – to ensure that the European Union faces this sensitive issue without showing its customary division, and appears united by making a positive, active contribution to the progress that needs to be made in this conflict.

Mr President, they say that when the celebrated thinker, Ortega y Gasset, was asked what distance one needed to be from events in order to write history, he said, far enough not to be able to see the profile of Cleopatra’s nose. Lady Ashton, I bring this anecdote up not because Egypt is a country affected by the Arab Spring but rather because in the EU, we are experiencing an historic dilemma involving a lack of confidence in our project, debt crisis, the calling into question of the basic achievements that are most valued by our citizens, such as the Schengen area, and doubts over the ability of NATO. However, over the last two and a half years, we have experienced tangible progress in the form of your own duties as Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the birth of the European External Action Service and the Joint Communication on a renewed European Neighbourhood Policy. You said yesterday that our neighbours will always be there and I share that view. The question is about us, whether we will rise to the occasion, whether we will live up to the expectations of our citizens, who regard foreign policy as a barometer for the state of the EU, whether we will be able to accompany these transition processes effectively in the countries that are the subject of the resolution that we will adopt tomorrow. Lady Ashton, we are clearly backing that. We believe and hope that you will succeed in your work, but in order to do so, you must act with the highest profile. Not a physical profile, like in Ortega’s response, but rather a political profile, with particular emphasis on finding the greatest common denominator and not the lowest common multiple. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the central factor in this overly broad debate should be the situation in North Africa and the Near East. We must approach this debate without extolling virtues – Baroness Ashton has rightly highlighted some positive elements; I would emphasise the good or, rather, the better provision of information between Parliament and the European External Action Service – yet also without concealing defects, and a voice as sensible as that of Giorgio Napolitano, our former fellow Member and President of the Italian Republic, has reminded us of this recently. Among the negative aspects, and despite the efforts of Baroness Ashton, is the different yardsticks against which the cases of Libya and Syria are measured in the United Nations Security Council and also in the Council of Ministers of the European Union. Also among the negative aspects, Baroness Ashton, is the situation of Camp Ashraf: you are aware of the positive, constructive and moderating role that my group is playing in the development of foreign policy, and believe me when I say that the importance and sensitivity of the Iranian dossier has not escaped me. However, in spite of the warnings about the humanitarian aspect made to your services, to your collaborators, to your cabinet and to your Director-General, and despite the fact that I submitted a draft statement to you myself, you did not speak out until there had been 32 deaths and more than 300 wounded. You can draw your own conclusions. You yourself said this morning that we have to act and we have to be coherent, particularly in relation to the defence of human rights; especially by taking risks, Baroness Ashton, when there are lives in danger. My question to you is this: with regard to the Cuban dissident, Juan Wilfredo Soto García, who was arrested, beaten and finally killed, are you willing to call for an investigation to shed light on these tragic events? If this investigation shows that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the beating received and his death, are you willing to condemn them? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Mr President, I entirely agree with what you have just said. Mr Németh, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that we have been continuously following the flow of information provided by the High Representative, Mrs Ashton, on the developments in these countries and I think we should recognise the efforts she is making on behalf of the European Union in support of the democratic aspirations in Bahrain, Yemen and Syria. Tomorrow, Parliament will adopt a resolution supported by all the political groups in this regard. However I would like to put forward a couple of questions, Mr President, and would ask Mr Németh to pass them on to Mrs Ashton. First of all, in some bodies of the Union and, of course, in this Parliament, there is the feeling that we are taking a step back in the development of the Common Security and Defence Policy, and that we are being taken back to the times of political cooperation. Obviously, that is not why we established the Treaty of Lisbon. Secondly, a contradiction has arisen, related to the growing need for a European presence in those countries, with no knowledge of what will be the end result of these transitional processes. It is clear that we have to be present, and it is also clear that the slogan used in Mrs Ashton’s communication is very wise: ‘more for more’ However, the question I wish to ask – and I shall conclude now, Mr President – is whether the EU Member States are willing to increase resources to meet the growing needs that are emerging in those countries. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Madam President, the crisis in North Africa is putting the mechanisms established in the Treaty of Lisbon to the test. Yesterday, in the High Representative’s appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we stressed the positive aspects of European Union action: Baroness Ashton’s communication that distinguishes between the short, medium and long terms; rapid application of Resolution 1970 of the United Nations Security Council; the ability to negotiate with the Arab League; and the European Council meeting. However, it is only fair to say here today that there are still certain questions being asked by European public opinion and, therefore, by our citizens. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt is absolutely right. How is it possible that, in this day and age, the four Member States that form part of the United Nations Security Council do not vote in the same way but rather do so differently? How is it possible, in this day and age, that we should be discussing whether the United Nations resolution is applied by the European Union, by NATO or by the international coalition, when we are talking about the same resources coming from the same taxpayers; about the same ships and their use in the same theatre of operations? It is clear that we still have much to improve as regards our capacity for coordination, and much to improve too in the decision-making process. There is a famous line from a film, which says that ‘we will always have Paris’. Someone said during this debate that the European Union’s response has been hasty. If it had not been for France’s courage, determination and consistency – and that is how it must be put – in recognising the rebels, in sending the Minister of Foreign and European Affairs to the Security Council, in calling the Elysée summit and in applying the resolution, Lady Ashton, Colonel Gaddafi’s troops would already have entered Benghazi.

 Mr President, the European Union finds itself torn between two frustrations in the Libyan crisis, between what is desirable – the earliest possible disappearance of a criminal regime that is determined to die killing – and what is achievable. If we are honest, Mr President, we must acknowledge that the European Union, despite all its efforts, has not lived up to public expectations. This is not a criticism, Baroness Ashton, but rather a question of powers. We have acted promptly and we have acted well, within the scope of our powers, with the European Union fully endorsing Resolution 1970 of the United Nations Security Council. However, we are not a military union. We are aspiring to be a political union, and we are still only an embryonic player on the international stage. This is why, Mr President, whilst we are holding this debate, whilst the United Nations Human Rights Council is meeting today, and whilst the Council of Ministers for Defence, the Foreign Affairs Council and the European Council are meeting tomorrow, people are still dying in Libya. It is against this backdrop that we must think about what it is that we can do. Can we stand aside whilst innocent civilians are massacred? Can we remain impassive to the ‘Somalisation’ of Libya, whilst the United Nations Security Council reaches another slow motion decision? The European Union must send a message that is loud and clear, and has a single message: ‘the Gaddafi regime must end right now’. This message must be accompanied by a set of measures that ratchet up the pressure. First and foremost, Mr President, the no-fly zone, the neutralising of Mr Gaddafi’s communications – and I believe we should congratulate the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe for bringing representatives of the Libyan opposition to the European Parliament – and, of course, international coordination, most particularly with the African Union and also with the Arab League. This, Mr President, is what the public is expecting of us, and you will have the full support of our political group to achieve it, Baroness Ashton. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, in the context of our debate on the current human rights situation, and in view of the last report discussed, I would like to address the following question to Lady Ashton. In view of the current situation in some North African countries and within the region, do you feel that this is the right time to be opening a European Union delegation in Iran? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 – (ES)
 Mr President, I did not really understand Lady Ashton’s answer. I am not sure whether she gave me an answer, whether she said that she would respond at a later date to my question on whether it is the right time to be opening a European Union delegation in Iran given the current human rights concerns, or indeed whether there was no answer. As I did not understand the answer, I would like to repeat my question. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, you quite rightly said, Baroness Ashton, that the situation in the southern Mediterranean is diverting attention from the conflict in the Middle East and the peace process, which has already been drawn out over almost 30 years and appears to have come to a standstill. As your visit has demonstrated, current events and the general situation in the region have had an impact on the process. In the light of that visit, I would like to ask your views on a number of issues. This morning, we discussed the difficulties that the United Nations Security Council is having in obtaining a further resolution to impose a no-fly zone in Libya. To what extent do you feel that the peace process and the credibility of a key player have been affected by its recent veto of the proposed resolution condemning the settlements in the Palestinian territories? In your opinion, how does the lack of a Security Council decision affect perceptions of the Obama administration’s commitment to pursuing this process? Secondly, how do you view the decision taken by the Palestinian National Authority to hold presidential and legislative elections before September and Hamas’s decision not to take part in these elections? Lastly, Baroness Ashton, I would like to hear what you think of the resignation of the Palestinian chief negotiator following the publication of documents by WikiLeaks, the reshuffle within the Palestinian National Authority and the repercussions that the leaked documents have had on the Palestine side, on the Israeli Government, or on both parties as a whole.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mubarak has disappeared from the scene and everyone seems to have breathed a sigh of relief. Firstly, the Egyptian people, who have seen their legitimate expectations of greater dignity and democracy satisfied, and, secondly, the international community that, not without a certain cynicism, has gone from being the ally of yesterday to the nuisance of today and, perhaps, to the accused of the future. However, Madam President, I do not believe that we should deceive ourselves. The departure of Mr Mubarak and Mr Ben Alí are necessary conditions, but not sufficient, to guarantee the process of democratic transition, over which there still hang many uncertainties. The most important thing is: to consolidate democracy. Madam President, it is also evident that, although democratic freedoms and human rights can be initiated by sixteen days of protest and public spiritedness, and be proclaimed by law from morning to night, economic and social progress cannot, unfortunately, be marshalled in the same manner. We have seen this in the heavy economic losses that both Egypt and Tunisia have been suffering in recent days. Returning to the Commissioner’s speech, I would like to say that, after the initial hesitations and some problems with the EU’s image, it appears that things are back on track. Baroness Ashton is in the region and what Mr Füle proposes makes a lot of sense. Firstly, to firmly and wholeheartedly support the process of democratic transition and the political reforms in those countries.Secondly, to carry out a critical review of the European neighbourhood policy in a way that strengthens the democratic clause. We have heard today, in the Enlarged Bureau, from the Polish Foreign Minister, the next President-in-Office of the Council, and his initiative to establish a Polish foundation on the subject of democracy and human rights. This could also be extended to the entire EU. Madam President, the EU has mobilised large amounts of resources in its Euro-Mediterranean policy with poor results. The EU’s image has suffered in this conflict, even more than that of other international players. However, the EU’s appeal remains intact. I would like to say, Madam President, that this is a good opportunity to underline that the EU understands, once and for all, that today history is being made in the present and in these historic times we are living through we have to act as a global player and perform the necessary duties or we will have to resign ourselves, Madam President, to not playing on the international stage in the role we want to maintain and we will have to restrict ourselves, as was the case until now, to picking up the bill for major global problems. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, whatever the result or outcome of the situation in Egypt, I believe that we are safe in saying that there will be a before and after the events that have taken place in Tunisia. It is my opinion that we should not be looking for culprits in this House as this crisis has caught the European Union on the wrong foot, however I feel that we ought to draw some conclusions on the matter. Firstly, the European Union needs to be more visible, it needs to speak with a unified voice and to avoid any cacophony; it is for this reason that we have created the European External Action Service and the figure of the High Representative. Secondly, we need to draw on the lessons offered to us by complacent policies with the enemies of freedom, from Belarus to Cuba and with the Mediterranean countries in between. We need to ask ourselves if there really is more stability, more prosperity and more democracy as the Barcelona Process intended. Thirdly, Mr President, I feel that we need to distinguish between what the European Union needs to do in the medium term and what it needs to do in the short term. In the short term – I think that Baroness Ashton has drawn up a road map – the European Union needs to offer resolute support to these transition processes so as not to frustrate these friendly countries’ hopes for freedom. It is also our duty, Mr President, to warn them of the risks involved in these processes, so they are not hijacked by the enemies of free societies. In the medium term, Mr President, it is important that the European Union reflects deeply on a strategic approach to reforming our neighbourhood policy as we also requested of Mr Füle yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. All of this must be done, Mr President, whilst bearing in mind that often it is more difficult to maintain the balance of freedom than to shake off the yoke of tyranny. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

Mr President, as stated in the text of the oral question that we have tabled, in the last three years, we have seen an escalation of the situation detrimentally affecting European Union interests and citizens in the southern Sahara, which has become a haven for the Islamic branch of al-Qaeda, with a whole string of murders, kidnappings, extortion, blackmail, drug trafficking and people trafficking, the victims of which have been German, Italian, Spanish and, most recently, French citizens. We therefore want to express our solidarity with our French fellow Members, and say, Baroness Ashton, that this situation demands a firm, unflinching response from the European Union, as President Sarkozy has demanded. In this context, this response needs to be made in the political, economic and development spheres, and Mr Danjean reminded us of the huge resources in the European Development Fund. Baroness Ashton, I would like you to give your assessment of the G8 anti-terrorism summit in October – when you received the Council mandate – in Mali, which Algeria did not attend. You said that the response needs to be a regional one. I think it is a bad sign that two of the parties in this conflict – such as Morocco and Algeria – are not cooperating with each other, on top of the unstable situation in Tunisia. Finally, Baroness Ashton, I would like you to give your assessment of the anti-terrorist centre created by Algeria 2 000 km south of Algiers, in which Mali, Mauritania and Niger are participating, and to tell me if you share the interpretation that the aim of this anti-terrorist centre is to prevent the European Union and the United States from being present in order to guarantee security in the area. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

Mr President, the recent events in Tunisia should encourage us to reflect with a sense of responsibility on at least two issues. Firstly, on whether policies to support the status quo 
in countries that lack democratic freedoms really contribute to stability, in this case, in our immediate vicinity. Secondly, Mr President, we should reflect on whether the disappearance of Mr Ben Ali from the political scene is sufficient to guarantee that a real democratic transition will be brought about. In my view, Mr President, the answer to both these questions is no. Therefore, Mr Füle, there needs to be a thorough reflection around why the Neighbourhood Policy, in the spirit of the Barcelona Process, has not had the intended democratising effects, and how we could or should make adjustments to it. Secondly, experience has shown us in many cases that, when there is a power vacuum, the most radicalised and extremist parties replace the process, hijack it and want to ruin it. Mr President, if it is simply to defend freedom, extremism is not a vice; if it is only to defend justice, moderation is not a virtue. This ethical imperative means that the European Union must mobilise all its efforts to help ensure that this process is not derailed. I welcome what Mr Füle said about providing electoral assistance to Tunisia, but I think that it is even more important to go a step further and support Tunisia through a European Union electoral observation mission. It is not only because of this ethical imperative that is etched in the genetic code of the European Union that we should do this, Mr President, but also in our own interests: because there is no point travelling first class if there is a passenger in economy with a bomb in his suitcase.

Madam President, the new strategic concept of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), which emerged in Lisbon, was established in order to seek to respond and adapt, firstly to a new context, in other words the disappearance of the system of blockades and the end of the Cold War. Secondly, it was established in order to adapt to the new configuration of threats, and particularly to globalisation and the fact that our armies do not have apparent enemies and our enemies do not have armies. Based on this new strategic concept, while taking into consideration Article 5 of the Treaty of Washington regarding mutual assistance, there are three aspects that I am interested in. Firstly, how to shape this strategic alliance with Europe: Baroness Ashton, I would like to ask you whether you think that Turkey should participate as much as possible in the actions and the development of the common foreign and security policy. Secondly, regarding the ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by the United States Congress, do you think that this new strategic concept will be affected if it is not ratified? Finally, what are your thoughts on the subject of the anti-missile shield? Do you think that this notion in any way compromises the goal of reducing nuclear arsenals? It seems that there are opposing views on this among the Member States. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Madam President, they say that the philosopher Aristotle was walking around his famous Peripatetic School with his students when one of them made a comment that upset his master. By way of apology, he said, ‘that was not my comment, it was made by your master Plato’. Then Aristotle stopped and pronounced a sentence that has been repeated numerous times on the European stage from the fourth century BC to the present day. He said, ‘Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is the truth’. Madam President, Morocco is a positive and active partner of the European Union, and it is also a strategic and fundamental ally in containing radical Islamic fundamentalism. However, as President Sarkozy said when he spoke here, Parliament is the democratic heartbeat of the European Union, and has an irrevocable and undeniable commitment to the cause of human rights. Therefore, if these rights are not acknowledged, it cannot stand aside and look the other way. It must speak out loud and clear about the principles that drive us. Madam President, the European Union has been, is and will be a loyal partner of Morocco, but that partnership is based on principles and values, and we have to proclaim those principles and values. I will conclude now, Madam President, by saying that truly, moderation in character or temperament is always a virtue, but moderation in the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially freedom of expression, is always a vice, always a weakness and always cowardly, and as representatives of the people of the European Union we cannot allow ourselves to act in that way.

Relations between the European Union and the United States are, as has already been said, based on principles, ideas, a shared history and a shared passion for freedom. These values could, however, end up being diluted in rhetoric and languishing if we do not move from words to actions. One of the most reliable pieces of work that has been done in this House on the state of transatlantic relations since the presidential elections is the report by my colleague, Mr Millán Mon. The report is included in the current joint motion for a resolution that we will vote on tomorrow, and contains a series of specific initiatives that are still perfectly valid for establishing a genuine partnership, on which we need to get to work, Commissioner. Here, there has been talk of the importance of economic and trade relations, and 15 EU Member States alone invest more in Texas than the 50 US States invest in Japan. We need to give new impetus to the summit mechanisms, create a Euro-American Assembly and, most importantly, create a coordination and consultation mechanism for global issues and the most crucial areas of the world – the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan – and relations with the emerging powers. Mr President, during President Obama’s recent tour of the Middle East, we heard him say that they saw their most important partnership as being that between the United States and India. This reminded me of one of the fundamental aspects of Mr Millán Mon’s report, in which he recalled President Obama saying in Berlin that Europe was the most important strategic ally of the United States. The upcoming EU-US summit will be a wonderful opportunity to clarify this point and to clearly define what the strategic partnership really is. We could start by asking the United States to support the European Union in its demands to have an institutional presence, for example, in the United Nations General Assembly, based on the new approaches introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon.

Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks for the work done by the general rapporteur on the budget. Although, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we have exercised moderation and we are aware that the appropriations under heading 4 are increasing substantially above the average, we consider them to be insufficient for guaranteeing a consistent, visible and effective foreign policy that is in line with the ambitions introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. We are also surprised that the Council is expressing surprise at some of the tactical cuts being proposed by Parliament, given the significance of the cuts, both in terms of compromise appropriations and in terms of payment appropriations, which the Council itself has introduced. I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets, represented here by its Chair, for putting the appropriations for the new positions in the European External Action Service in reserve. Naturally, Mr President, this does not mean that we should not have a positive and constructive attitude, but obviously, in the conciliation process, Parliament has to be firm, very firm, in demanding its priorities, with the objective and aim of having the capacity to produce a budget for 2011, just as the President-in-Office of the Council has just said.

 Madam President, today’s debate does indeed raise the question of how to build a strategic partnership with China based on its economic potential and on our value system, particularly with respect to human rights, which have to be of a universal nature. Garton Ash, a brilliant British analyst, said that relations with China pose four problems, all of which begin with the letter ‘t’: trade, Taiwan, Tibet – and here, I would like to remind the House of the suspension of the EU-China summit in 2008 – and lastly, Tiananmen, in reference to the human rights issue. What is obvious, as Mr Kasoulides has said, is that none of the challenges facing the world at present, such as globalisation, the digital economy, reform of the financial system, the security issue, the fight against nuclear proliferation – just look at the case of Iran – environmental and natural resource conservation or energy supply security, can be resolved without the cooperation of China. The United States has managed to establish a structured relationship with China, though not without its problems. President Bush presented the Dalai Lama with the Congressional Gold Medal; nonetheless, relations between both countries are still functional. Commissioner, bearing in mind the importance of China on the world scene, in the United Nations Security Council, in the G20 and in the BRIC countries, will we, as the European Union, be capable of building and consolidating this relationship? More importantly, Madam President, will we, from the European Union, be able to smooth out the path to freedom given that rather unique system that is Chinese state capitalism? I believe, Madam President, that this is the most important question, and I would ask you, Commissioner, to defend our value system at the forthcoming summit, while also displaying a certain pragmatism.

Mr President, we are all pleased about the freeing of political prisoners in Cuba. However, on the subject of congratulations, I have not heard any offered to the Catholic Church and, in particular, to Parliament for the role it played, which has been key in the determined defence of all of those fighting for their freedom and dignity in Cuba. With regard to the subject of Mercosur, there are several clarifications that need to be made. As Commissioner De Gucht has explained, the Commission put forward some negotiation directives for the purposes of concluding an association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which were adopted by the Council and by Parliament. Negotiations have been deadlocked for six years, and it is clear that they have been reopened within the framework of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, with the support also of Parliament. The objective, at this point in time, is to reach a balanced agreement that shows overall consideration for the interests of all sectors within the European Union. I do not understand why certain sectors or interest groups should come out of this negotiation at a disadvantage. It has not been like this for 10 years, and there is no reason why it should be like this in the future. It will depend on the firmness of our negotiators. In any case, if this situation were to come about, it is clear that the Commission would need to come up with compensatory measures for the sectors affected. This is what has been done with third countries, with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and with the most recent agreements with the Andean Community. The main reason that this has been done with these countries is the need to defend European Union producers, of bananas in this case.

On behalf of the Spanish delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we would like to state that the reasoning behind our vote on the resolution on the process relating to the European integration of Kosovo is that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it were an independent state in an entirely normal situation, without taking into account the fact that the status of this territory continues to be very controversial within the international community – an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice is also pending – and Kosovo has not been recognised by five Member States of the European Union, including Spain.

 Mr President, the consultation procedure concludes with today’s declaration by the High Representative and tomorrow’s vote. It is therefore now time to thank all those whose work has made the European External Action Service (EEAS) possible, especially the European Parliament’s rapporteurs, to implement it faithfully and to ensure that it is able to come into operation as soon as possible, without losing sight of the fact that it is not an end in itself, but an instrument for providing the European Union with a foreign policy that is coherent, visible and effective. I am convinced that the guarantees that Baroness Ashton gave in her declaration are satisfactory from the point of view of political responsibility, and are in line with the prerogatives that the treaty assigns to Parliament as part of the information, consultation and partnership process. You may be assured, Baroness Ashton, that this House will be a loyal partner in the development of foreign and common security policy, as we have shown in the meetings that we have held with the new heads of delegation from Washington and Afghanistan., However, Baroness Ashton, we have a right to expect that the new service will be more effective and better than the existing one. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to wish you luck in putting the EEAS into practice, and say to you that, as the evangelical instruction has it, ‘by your works shall you be known’.

Mr President, irrespective of the contradictory versions of events – humanitarian flotilla or provocation strategy – Parliament must condemn the use of violence and must condemn the loss of human life, as it is irreparable. There are causes behind these events, and they have had consequences. Apart from the most distressing consequence which, as I said, is the loss of human life, the consequences include the derailment of the peace process; the distancing between Israel, the European Union and the United States; the separation in relations with moderate Arab countries; and increased tension in the region, with the Iranian nuclear spectre hovering over the whole area. I also think, Mr President, that the breakdown in relations with Turkey is an important factor. Baroness Ashton said something that I entirely agree with. Restoring dignity and hope to the Palestinian people will benefit the cause of peace in the region, security in Israel and, above all, the cause of the moderates and the unity of the Palestinian cause. It is certain – and we should not lose sight of this – that the lifting of the embargo is just one step. It is an important step, but it is just one step along the road towards peace. We are aware of the elements: the recognition of a viable Palestinian state; security for Israel’s borders; the resolution of the problem of East Jerusalem; the problem of the settlements, which needs to be brought to an end; and – I am concluding, Mr President – other issues. There are two issues involved in resolving this matter. One is international support and the other is political will. I am not sure, High Representative, that there is currently a sufficient mobilisation of political will. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

In view of the fact that some of the expressions included in paragraph 34, introduced by the opinion of the Committee on Development, are so ambiguous that they could be interpreted as being somewhat complacent regarding something as repulsive as abortion, the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has asked the group for a separate vote on that paragraph, in order to make it crystal clear that it is opposed to any initiative aimed at infringing the inalienable rights of the most vulnerable.

Madam President, High Representative, I would like to say that the report, as adopted by the committee, on the one hand, acknowledges the efforts made by the Spanish Presidency of the European Union – which I do not see in this Chamber, which surprises me given that we are talking about a Latin American matter – and, on the other hand, welcomes the Commission communication entitled ‘The European Union and Latin America: Global Players in Partnership’. I think it is difficult to find two regions that have more in common in terms of values and interests than Europe and Latin America. The figures, Madam President, are very well known: together, they have more than a billion citizens, account for more than 25% of global gross domestic product and, along with the Caribbean countries, include almost one third of the countries that make up the United Nations. It is also well known, although the figures show a slight decline, that the European Union is the main donor of development aid, the main investor in the region and the second largest trading partner in Latin America, and the largest in Mercosur and Chile. However, more importantly than the figures, we consider Latin America to be more than a market for Europe, and we therefore share a whole series of principles and values, which are pluralist and representative democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression, the constitutional state, the rule of law, respect for due process and the rejection of all forms of dictatorship and authoritarian rule. This summit, Mrs Ashton, comes at a very remarkable time in the calendar for the European Union and Latin America. It is a remarkable time for the European Union, because having gone through the reform process, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are a little engrossed in overcoming and contemplating our own problems, with the economic and monetary crisis. We have seen that, for the first time, the International Monetary Fund is not having to rescue a Latin American country, but a European Member State that is part of the Monetary Union. When we look at the European Union’s growth rates for last year, we see that, on average, we had a negative growth of 5%, while Latin America had a negative growth of 1.8%. When we look at the forecasts for growth for next year, we see that the European Union is expected to have an average growth of 0.7%, and Latin America of 5%. This means that the next summit is not going to be a North-South summit, like the previous summits, but a summit between equals. In that respect, I think that we should look back, if only briefly, and feel satisfied at what has been achieved in the last few years. It is clear, however, that a great deal still remains to be done. In that respect, Mrs Ashton, between 2000 and 2010, the European Union concluded association agreements with Mexico and Chile, but the United States concluded agreements with the whole of Central America, with Colombia and Peru, and also with various Mercosur countries. We therefore need to make up for lost time quickly, and in some way seek strategic partnerships with Mexico and Chile, apply the future developments clause in these agreements, and conclude the agreements with Central America, where we need to introduce greater measures of generosity. At the same time, Parliament welcomes the initiatives that you have put forward to establish the Europe-Latin America Foundation and also the financial investment facility. This summit is not, however, just another summit, Mrs Ashton. At this one, a very clear issue is going to be at stake. If we continue to lose our share of trade with the region, which has declined from 25% to just over 15% because of countries such as China, we are going to become irrelevant. Therefore, in line with the Spanish Presidency, I ask you, as High Representative and a Vice-President of the Commission, to send out a clear and very definite message regarding the commitment of this new Europe that we are building towards our old friends in Latin America. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their speeches. I would like to say to you, Mrs Ashton, that the fundamental element that will ensure that these relations move forward in the coming years will be the mobilisation of political will. Political reasons were behind the ministerial dialogue in San José in 1985; political reasons were behind the institutionalisation of the dialogue with the Rio Group in 1990; and political reasons were behind going over and above this in the summits mechanism. I would like to respond to Mr Kožušník by saying that we are indeed a community of values, and I would like to point out that in the last part-session, we adopted an important resolution on Cuba in which we called for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners. I would like to take this opportunity to ask Mrs Ashton to intercede on behalf of a dissident, Marta Beatriz Roque, who is on conditional release and is ill. She has just obtained Spanish nationality in a case promoted by a former MEP, Fernando Fernández Martín, so that she can come to Spain to be treated. However, we need to move from words to actions, and this is shown in the association agreements. I think, Mrs Ashton, that you have negotiated the agreements with Colombia and Peru very well. I think that although the human rights situation in Colombia still gives cause for concern, it has improved substantially. The Colombian people are clamouring for peace, and this agreement is definitely deserved. I also sincerely believe that a majority in Parliament is in favour of this agreement. Mrs Ashton, we need to give the Central Americans some room to breathe in the negotiations. We represent 25% of their exports, and they represent 2% of ours. We need to be generous and, as you said, we need to re-launch the agreement with Mercosur. To conclude, Mr President, I think that on the one hand, the European Union is in decline, in economic terms, and on the other, it is strengthened by the presence of the High Representative. Therefore, we need her to make a significant effort to demonstrate our political will at the Madrid Summit and to continue keeping relations with Latin America high on the European Union’s agenda.

Madam President, when my group asked for this matter to be included on the agenda, it did not do so in order to highlight errors, which are sometimes irreparable, in policies that indulge the enemies of freedom. It also did not do so in order to gain political return from this condemnation. It did so in order that Parliament, which is the institution at the democratic heart of the European Union, could speak out to condemn the death of an innocent person, and, above all, to express its solidarity with those in Cuba who are fighting, living and dying, like Orlando Zapata, for their freedom and their dignity. As the European Commission said, the Council’s common position is still valid, and it is an honourable position because it asks for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners. It is also a consistent position, because it asks for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be respected, in order for Cuba to be rooted in our system of values and not in foreign systems such as those of China or Vietnam. Madam President, the words of a brave man, Oswaldo Paya, who won the Sakharov Prize in 2002, still resound in this House. He said that the first victory to be proclaimed was that there was no hate in his heart. He said to those who oppressed him, who were his brothers, that he did not hate them, but that they were not going to impose their will through fear. He said that Andrei Sakharov left a legacy of dignity and of working towards peoples living together peacefully, and that often the voices that count the most are the voices that are not heard. In this House, we have not been able to hear the voices of the ‘Ladies in White’, 
who were also awarded the Sakharov Prize by Parliament. Now we will unfortunately not be able to hear the voice of Orlando Zapata, but soon we will be able to hear the voices of many more Cubans. In the meantime, Madam President, with the legitimacy that Parliament has in representing 500 million citizens from the 27 Member States of the Union, it needs to loudly and clearly echo the unstoppable shout of freedom that we are hearing from the beloved island of Cuba. (Applause) José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

Mr President, yesterday, during the debate on the motion for a resolution on which we are about to vote, we expressed our sorrow at the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a 42-year-old builder and Cuban political prisoner, who died after a hunger strike and many years of arbitrary, unjust, inhumane and cruel imprisonment. In this House yesterday, Commissioner Georgieva strongly and forcefully condemned this event. I am calling on you, Mr President, on behalf of Parliament, to send your condolences to Mr Zapata’s family, which is being harassed at his funeral. I would ask you to communicate to the Cuban authorities your strongest condemnation of this completely avoidable death, which the head of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, Elizardo Sánchez, described as a murder dressed up as justice. I hope, Mr President, that this death will lead to reflection among those who, out of good faith or naivety, want to change the Council’s common position, an honourable position that merely serves to link any improvement in relations with the island to human rights and fundamental freedoms, which, as we have seen, continue to be violated. (Applause) José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
).

Mr President, I think that this is an excellent opportunity to affirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights, which is what this motion for a joint resolution to be adopted tomorrow does. Parliament has expressed its opinion on several occasions, normally through the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World, and through various resolutions, as we did recently in the case of Iran. Some fellow Members have referred to the paradox – a word that they have used – of certain countries that have an extremely poor record on human rights being part of the body that is responsible for monitoring them, and I think that the case of Iran is one of the most obvious ones. This is not the only example, and I think that the United Nations will become ineffective if it is really resourced by these countries, and will lose all political legitimacy and moral authority to condemn these events. While I am talking about this, Mr President, this week, another of Parliament’s bodies has been considering the expulsion of a member of this House, the expulsion of Cuba. In addition, today we must mourn the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a 42-year old builder and political prisoner, who has died following a hunger strike and arbitrary, inhumane and cruel imprisonment. The Chair of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, Elizardo Sánchez, a person who is very close to the spirit of social democracy, has said that this death was entirely avoidable and that he considers it to be a murder dressed up as justice. Commissioner, I would like to ask you – as we already know the position of the President-in-Office – if you think, from an ethical and democratic point of view, in response to the deplorable events such as the death of Mr Zapata, and if the Commission thinks, that relations between the European Union and Cuba need to be raised to a higher level and given priority?

 Mr President, like my fellow Members, I also wish to congratulate Mr Füle on having taken office and I hope that the excellent impression he made in his Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing will be confirmed over the course of his mandate, particularly in the sensitive area of enlargement. I would like to say a few words about Turkey, firstly to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the excellent results obtained in the committee. Her report, which refers to 2008 and 2009, neither overstates nor underplays matters; it highlights the efforts Turkey is making to try to meet the Copenhagen conditions and criteria. In my view, however, these efforts need to be considered within Turkey’s current context and political situation: seven years of Mr Erdoğan’s moderate Islamic government, with elections expected in July 2011; a country that is seething from the Operation Sledgehammer cases; from the annulment of the Emasya Protocol, which handed major powers over to the military; and, in particular, from the ruling that has banned the activities of the Democratic Society Party in Turkey. This context, Commissioner, means that the Turkish case needs to be handled with great caution. Turkey has to meet the conditions and requirements of the Copenhagen criteria and, obviously, it has to comply with the Ankara Protocol. However, in this particular context and situation, it goes without saying, Commissioner, that if any wrong signal is sent out, it could have very serious consequences for the security of the European Union, especially when the governing party does not have the three-fifths majority it needs in parliament in order to modify the constitution; such a signal could seriously give rise to alarming turmoil in an already unstable country that is a strategic partner for the West, in the context of the Atlantic Alliance. We need to use the utmost caution in the negotiating process in order not to make any mistakes. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, before we vote on this draft resolution on Iran, I merely wish to inform the Chamber that there has been an attempt to storm the Italian Embassy in Tehran and that similar incidents have also taken place at the embassies of other Member States, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Mr President, in Paragraph 24, this draft resolution calls for a European Union delegation to be established in Iran; my group would not want the adoption of this paragraph, which has been used in other European Parliament resolutions, to be taken as a sign of complacency with regard to these events. I would therefore ask Mr Füle to tell Mrs Ashton that the circumstances I have just mentioned should be borne in mind during the application of this resolution's mandate. I believe Mr Gahler is going to request the addition of an oral amendment to the resolution text so that the diplomatic interests of Member States can be protected in Iran.

Madam President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, I would first of all like to point out that the European Parliament has expressed its opinion on the situation of the prisoners in Guantánamo on various occasions through various resolutions. In his inauguration speech, President Obama said that he was making a commitment to close the Guantánamo detention centre within a year. This deadline passed on 22 January and the fact that it has not been closed is proof that often in politics it is easier to make promises than to keep them. Also, as the representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council said, President Obama’s personal representative has visited the European Union, met with our President and with several Member States and asked for our cooperation, which has to be offered on the basis of a series of premises mentioned by the Commissioner. One of these is that this is a problem created by the previous government of the United States, and that the European Union has to cooperate, but on the basis of certain requirements, in particular, the security of our Member States. In this respect, I would like to recall the decision made by some Member States, including the one that currently holds the Presidency of the Council, my own country. I would like to ask the representative of the Spanish Presidency if he is thinking of taking any additional measures to try to harmonise the response of the Member States to the problems that have arisen in Yemen in particular, or whether he is intending to leave this decision to the individual and sovereign context of each Member State, as decided by the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs. One final question, Madam President: it is indeed true that 100 out of the 190 or so prisoners that remain have been sent to their countries of origin or to third countries, and that 40 are going to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts. There are, however, still 50 that are not going to be released because there is not sufficient proof to take them into custody but the risk that they actually pose has forced the United States Government to decide that they should not be released. I would like to ask the Commission and the Council what they think about the situation of these 50 people who are not going to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

 Mr President, I would firstly like to say that the intergovernmental treaty was the only possible solution in an emergency situation. However, this treaty means a redistribution of sovereignty, a new social compact, and requires greater involvement on the part of the Commission and Parliament in order to give it legitimacy. What was the aim of these agreements? Two things, as President Van Rompuy has said. Firstly, to convince the markets that we want to continue together, that this is not a pegged exchange rate system that can be reversed at any time, and secondly, to stabilise the markets. I agree that, over the medium term, fiscal union was absolutely essential, because this crisis has been caused in part by government excess. However, it is not just the excesses of governments that have caused the crisis. Ireland and Spain had sound public finances and yet they are also in difficulties, because they were not competitive enough, because there was too much private indebtedness. This is why I place enormous importance on correcting macro-economic imbalances, which has gone somewhat unnoticed, and enormous importance on the issue of growth, which has gone unnoticed too. The uncertainty is greater with regard to stabilising the markets. I agree that we have corrected the private participation mistake: it was an error and we have put it right now. We have made a little progress on rescue mechanisms, but I am not sure that the provision made will be sufficient and that we will have the financing resources to make them effective. There are questions about leveraging the temporary mechanism and doubts about the permanent mechanism. Mr Barroso, I ask you to continue with the basket of bonds that, in my opinion, would be a good way of financing this fund. It would overcome the fragmentation in the debt market and make sovereign debt a risk-free asset once again. The European Central Bank will only act if it believes the summit will bring security, and we will see in the coming days whether it does or not. However, if it does not, it will have to seek alternative options, because we cannot go into battle against the crisis with one arm tied behind our backs. If the Member States have to insure against possible losses, then let them do so, but let us find a way of stabilising the markets that, may I say, are not doing well at all right now. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I think that, in order for this exercise to be useful, we should start by telling the truth. The truth is that we are not capable of resolving any of the problems that we have on the table: neither the problem of Greece, nor the problem of Italy. This incapacity to resolve these problems is affecting every economy in the European Union, it is rendering the efforts of Ireland and Portugal useless, and it is spreading contagion everywhere, including to Belgium and France. The truth is that the penalty for sovereign debt does not arise for economic reasons, because the foundations of our current account deficit are better than those of the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. Therefore, if it does not arise for economic reasons, it is because it arises only for political reasons. We have not succeeded in finding the right model, and we do not have the institutional structures to resolve the issue. Up to now, all the solutions that have been adopted – and many have been discussed – all those that have been accepted are based on a restrictive fiscal policy and a restrictive monetary policy; this simply has not worked. Now is probably the time to consider whether we should look at other models, for example the Anglo-Saxon model, which is based on a lighter fiscal policy and an ultra–accommodating monetary policy. Obviously we cannot import the model to the European Union exactly as it is. No state, except probably Germany, is in a position to boost public spending, lower taxes or borrow. The room for manoeuvre is very limited, and it will be necessary to submit to fiscal discipline. We can, however, do this at EU level, and that is what you are responsible for. What needs to be done? I think that in the first place the European Central Bank has to do much more that it is doing now. Since 2007, the Federal Reserve has increased its budget by 226%. The European Central Bank has increased its budget by 103%. The Bank of England has a volume of debt equal to 16% of the gross domestic product of the United Kingdom. That of the European Central Bank is only 2%. Secondly, a bailout fund will have to be put in place using Eurobonds – with joint responsibility until the Treaty is amended – but before 9 December. It will then be necessary to cater for growth using the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the project bonds, which are like the Loch Ness monster: we all talk about it but nobody has seen it. If that is not done, what Minister Tremonti said in Italy will happen: the Titanic will sink and it will take everyone with it, including the first class passengers. That is your responsibility. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
).

 Mr President, the fact that there was fumata bianca
 this morning is good news, albeit good news which I would like to clarify. The restructuring of the Greek debt is also good news, but we would do well to admit that we were wrong, because, under the initial conditions, Greece would never have been able to pay. If we had acted sooner, the Greek people would have suffered less and the cost of the bailout would have been lower. Recapitalisation of the banks: I need to look at it in detail, but I do not really understand why they have changed the criteria for evaluating sovereign debt, but have made no alteration to the evaluation of toxic assets, and I do not understand why they have set a ‘one size fits all’ rule for the limit on capital, thus establishing similar recapitalisation limits for financial institutions which, in fact, are not similar. The Spanish Government will have to explain the transfers that it has carried out, but that will be done at home. On the other hand, the Commission does have to explain to us here why we are facing a banking crisis without it having submitted the proposal for a directive on crisis resolution mechanisms, as it promised to do when we spoke about financial supervision. A new storm, and still the lifeboats are not ready. Lastly, it is good news that they are boosting the firepower of the bailout fund. It is just a shame that we have to look externally because we are incapable of sorting out our own problems internally, and we will only do so if we have a comprehensive plan that simultaneously addresses macro-economic discipline, debt sustainability and, above all, growth. It is time that the Commission came up with a universal plan and for us to get moving. If we have to amend the Treaties, well, let us do it, but we need to do it in stages, starting now. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

 Mr President, we are clearly in a serious situation that calls for all of us to be responsible. All of us, including the Council. The difference that separates us today from the Council is the issue of reverse qualified majority voting. We all know that the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has not worked because the Member States have decided not to punish each other for any violation of budgetary discipline. Perhaps this is because they have read in the Gospel the quote that says, ‘Let he who is without sin cast the first stone’. What this Parliament wants – and this is what distinguishes it from the Council – is to put an end to this joyous camaraderie between governments, and replace a biased referee with an impartial one. The package is good and deserves to be voted through. When times are hardest, no one would ever consider saying that we have to spend more. What we are now doing is restoring budgetary discipline. However, when something is good it is not necessarily enough. The speeches we have heard today have shown several things. We all knew that the eurozone was not an optimum currency area. Everyone thought that the current institutional framework – a centralised monetary policy, a Stability and Growth Pact, and the coordination of the other economic policies – would enable the differences between Member States to be overcome, or at least reduced. That has not been the case. In the good times, their differences only increased; in the bad times, the pillars on which the monetary union was established were left in ruins. The ‘no-bailout’ principle, the ‘no-default’ principle, and now the ‘no-exit’ principle could also be out the window. We now find ourselves in Lenin’s ‘What is to be done?’ situation. The only solution is to move forward on the issue of political union. I welcome the issue of Eurobonds. It is a positive step in that direction, but more needs to be done. If establishing a political union requires reforming the Treaties by convening a convention, so be it. There is a Greek proverb that says, ‘rules are made for man, and not man for rules’. It is not a question of continuing trialogues until three o’clock in the morning or holding ministerial meetings at six o’clock in the morning. From now on let us think about what can be done to remedy this situation. The first step, however, is to vote in favour of this package, which is a good step in the right direction. Otherwise we will be making a futile effort and, as Mr Ortega y Gasset was just saying, futile effort leads to melancholy and – in politics – to opposition. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). - 
 (ES) 
Madam President, this issue raises a question, just one question: at European level what can we do to give work to those who do not  have it? To respond to that question I want to make clear the first agreed point. There can be no sustainable growth without a stable macroeconomy. Some of the quick solutions that have been proposed here, especially from the leftwing Members, would mean bread for today and hunger for tomorrow. The second agreed point is that Europe 2020 is a compendium of good intentions, it sounds good, but we have to move from contemplation to action. What are we going to do? How are we going to finance the proposed initiatives and actions? Is the ambition contained in the words of the 2020 Strategy compatible with the budgets cuts that have been announced? The third agreed point is that we need a complete picture if we are to set ourselves on the right path towards stable growth. To date this picture does not yet exist. What is currently happening in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council shows that among them there are a huge amount of scattered, incoherent and inconsistent ideas. There are three important actions to be taken. Firstly, stifling countries in difficulties cannot continue, and can be solved by a joint issuing of European bonds. Secondly, the bonds specified in the Monti Report have to be implemented, but they are not mentioned in the Europe 2020 Economic Strategy. Thirdly, we have to use the European Investment Bank’s resources, two thirds of which are the Commission’s, and which would only have to be increased fourfold in 10 years in order to equal the money that the Marshall Plan had for the reconstruction of the European economy. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, anyone who reads the newspapers today will find out two things: that we are at a crucial point in the sovereign debt crisis, and that the European response is a succession of isolated provisions with no internal consistency. Even now, we have on the table the European Semester, the economic governance package, the provisional and permanent rescue strategy, the so-called ‘Eurobonds’ to cover part of the sovereign debt that is considered to be secure, plus an action plan based on the European Investment Bank and bonds for specific projects, which is in the proposal that the Commission sent us on the internal market. The first thing that the rapporteurs are trying to do is to combine all of this and create a complete design, a final picture to be shown to the public. Secondly, this design needs to be a European design that does not divide Europe in two – let us not stumble into a two-speed Europe – and that pursues two objectives with equal intensity: budgetary discipline – as much as is necessary – and economic growth to bring us out of the crisis that we are in. I have one comment regarding the rescue mechanism to which the President-in-Office of the Council was referring. In his first statement, he said that private investors would participate in the rescue plans, which caused shock and led to a protest by the President of the European Central Bank. It was explained, as Mr Van Rompuy did just now, that firstly, it would be case-by-case – who decides and based on what criteria? – and secondly, that it would be done according to the criteria and policies of the International Monetary Fund. The only case in which the International Monetary Fund has used this type of rescue plan was in Argentina in 2003; it plunged the country into chaos, from which it has still not emerged, and the private bondholders have still not been paid. Regarding Eurobonds, many issues have been set out here today. I would just like to add two more. It would create a market as liquid as that in the United States, and would give a boost to the euro as a reserve currency, enabling the central banks and sovereign funds to invest their reserves here. My final comment is that this needs to be complemented by the European Investment Bank and the specific bonds to respond to growth. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, I am not going to emphasise what has already been said. The Belgian Presidency has been excellent. I would like to mention two highlights: financial supervision and the European Semester. Regarding these highlights, I would like to say what has been done and, most importantly, what needs to be done. In terms of financial supervision, in the space of 48 hours, the Minister, Mr Reynders, managed to get a dossier that was in deadlock moving, and we were able to give the Council and the Commission what the Commission had asked of us: European authorities that could begin operating on 1 January 2011: strong, authentically European authorities with clout. What happened next is not very reassuring. We still do not have presidents for the authorities; we have an extraordinarily small budget and I am told that the rewards for those who are going to hold positions in these authorities are not brilliant. They are, of course, much less brilliant than the bonuses received by bankers in London. There are two matters that still need to be dealt with: the regulation of the systemic bodies, and contributions and taxes on banking. In the regulation of systemic bodies, we want the European authority to be responsible for supervision, through the national authorities, which, in this case, would act as agents and would be subject to the instructions of the European authority. The alternative would not make sense. In terms of taxation, the most recent offering from Commissioner Šemeta sets out all the possible taxes for banks. Parliament has already adopted two contributions: the contribution to the coordinated guarantee funds and the contribution to the banking stability funds. This is a fact, and next we will be able to discuss the tax on banking or taxes on banking transactions, because, I stress, the rest is a fact. In terms of the European Semester, the only thing that we want is to coordinate with everything: with Eurobonds, with project bonds, with the mechanism, etc. … (The President cut off the speaker) José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, what we need right now are clear rules, and what we are doing is precisely the opposite. I am therefore going to make a few proposals in order to re-establish clarity. In the European semester, Parliament wants to focus on a series of discussions, which are currently unfocused and do not fit with public opinion. We want the political responses to the recommendations made to the Member States over the next six months to be taken into account when establishing the penalties provided for in the legislative package on governance. My group would like to make it clear that there are no magic solutions in the legislative package for getting us out of the crisis. There are the well-known methods of budgetary discipline and structural reforms in order to maintain competitiveness. With regard to the crisis mechanism, as you said yesterday, Commissioner, President Barroso promised us here that it was going to be a European mechanism. Today the Council is proposing an intergovernmental mechanism. Is this European – in Mr Barroso’s terms – because it appears that the fund will be based in Europe rather than in the Cayman Islands, or does the Commission intend to help us to create a mechanism following EU procedure in which Parliament has a contribution to make? With regard to eurobonds, the Commission, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the experts say that it is a good idea, but that it is a premature idea, therefore we are late. What I propose to the Commission is that we begin a debate to shape a system of eurobonds that gives reasonable financing to the countries that do the right thing and punishes those that do not by forcing them to go to the markets at rates that are genuine deterrents. That is the only workable way of combining fiscal discipline and economic growth. Do not come back to me with discussions about whether it is too early or too late, because what we know now is that we have always been too late. Let us see if, for once, by changing the rules, we can be early. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

Madam President, Commissioner, the two block exemption regulations, one of which refers to specialisation agreements and the other to research and development, will expire on 31 December of this year. The Commission has drawn up two legislative proposals: two proposals for regulations that are before this House to replace the regulations that are now coming to an end. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since the initial regulations were adopted. There have been significant changes in legislation, especially the 2003 modernisation package, crucial legal judgments have been passed in this area and the Commission has learnt quite a lot from practice, which is also an important aspect. The Commission opened two rounds of consultations with those concerned, which is good practice in the spirit of legislating well and having public support. The big question now is as follows: what use is it going to make of the responses from those concerned during the consultation? Is it going to take notice of them or are these opinions simply going to be thrown in the bin? In this context, what Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs want to know is essentially six things. What are the suggestions and specific ideas that the stakeholders have put forward that the Commission is going to take into account when it comes to designing and defining these regulations and taking them from ‘the muses to the theatre’? Secondly, what does the Commission think about the horizontal agreements that are not covered by the exemption regulations on specialisation or research and development. What did the stakeholders say in this round of consultations? What would be the advantages from the point of view of industry, the real economy and protecting competition, of proposing new regulations to take into account horizontal agreements that are not covered by the two block exemption regulations that we are currently considering? Does the Commission intend to draw up new regulations to cover them? Yes or no? The question is relatively clear. The third problem that was debated at length in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is the subject of what is known as ‘patent ambush’, which, as the Commissioner is aware, takes place when one of the stakeholder companies that is participating in establishing standards withholds information on the patents that it holds or the patents that it is planning to register in future. This causes serious damage and inconvenience to those companies that are unaware of that information and commit to acting according to the parameters established. The question here is relatively specific as this is a case of distortion of competition and barriers in the internal market, which is the cardinal sin in our institution: does the Commission intend to tackle the problem of ‘patent ambush’ in the framework of the new draft regulations, or otherwise, does it consider that complementary sector-specific legislation would be necessary to avoid abuse of patent rights? Is the Commission committed to ensuring that there is an integrated, consistent legislative framework without internal contradictions between competition rules and sector-specific legislation in the area of intellectual property rights? The fourth and fifth questions relate to economic governance or, if you prefer, governance of competition. We have learnt that we need to try to converge with other competition authorities and, in this respect, it is important to know to what extent the Commission, in drawing up these regulations, has made use of court decisions and the decisions of national and international authorities. The last question refers to a subject that is a particularly sensitive one for my committee, and I am sure that Mr Schwab will have something to say about it. It refers to the marketing chain for food products. It seems obvious that there is inequality in conditions among producers, between farmers, on the one hand, and large chains, on the other. Does the Commission intend to do something to guarantee equal, fair treatment for the weaker party in this contract? These are the questions, Commissioner, that I would like to you to answer as fully, clearly and precisely as possible. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

Madam President, today is a good day for Europe. In December, we had a poor agreement and now, thanks to the cooperation between Parliament, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, we have a good agreement. It is a good agreement that is going to establish genuinely European authorities that are strong and subject to the democratic control of Parliament: authorities that are going to be designed to ensure that all the banks are subject to the same rules across the European Union. They will be able to impose their decisions on the national supervisory bodies and, if they do not comply with them, on the private banks, in order to protect families and businesses. This will enable them to combat the banks that could cause systemic risks and prevent taxpayers from having to pay once again for the irrational exuberance of some financial institutions. The lesson that we can learn from this debate is that Parliament is not like a dog whose bark is worse than his bite that will back down at the slightest gesture from the Council: it holds firmly to its positions. Nor is it a dog in the manger: it is a good ally of the Council and the Commission for moving forward in the process of European integration. Thanks to my fellow Members, Commissioner Barnier and Mr Reynders, we now have an excellent agreement on which we should congratulate ourselves. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

 Madam President, on behalf of my group – and I believe on behalf of all the rapporteurs – I am going to request that, within the following reports that make up this package – the Giegold report, the Goulard report, my own report and the Skinner report – the amended Commission proposal be put to a roll-call vote. It is important to know that Parliament has the level of mandate that we have to negotiate with the Council. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, I would like quite simply to thank the other rapporteurs, as we have worked together in an exemplary manner on what was a difficult package: we had before us a Council agreement that had been approved unanimously. Parliament now has a mandate that was also approved practically unanimously, with the enormous advantage that the winds are blowing in Parliament’s direction and not that of the Council’s text, which now seems extraordinarily archaic. Thank you to my group, thank you to all of the groups, and thank you to Parliament, which has won an important victory today. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Cassandra had a gift: that of telling the future. She also bore a curse: that of not being listened to. For this reason, Troy fell. Parliament anticipated more than 10 years ago that liberalising the markets, without putting in place European supervision mechanisms at the same time, would lead to a crisis in the system, for one very simple reason: cross-border institutions cannot be supervised by national authorities whose jurisdiction ends at their borders. They can only be supervised by European authorities. We did not take heed of this, and the crisis erupted. Exotic products, unknown even to their creators, flooded the markets. Nobody trusted anybody else, nobody lent to anybody else, and credit dried up. The result: 23 million unemployed and EUR 3.5 billion – one third of our production – committed to aid the financial sector. Now what? We in Parliament have been at odds with the Council for some days now. Parliament has given a great deal of ground in order to reach an agreement; the Commission too. The Belgian Presidency has shown great willing. It has asked us for time. We are going to give it time, but let us show today that Parliament is united, that it has very clear ideas. For this reason, let us vote massively in favour tomorrow of the amendments that the most influential groups within this House have put forward jointly. There are several ideas that Parliament would like to highlight. The first is that the crisis will only be overcome when confidence recovers and transparency is re-established within markets, institutions and products. This will only be possible when there are European supervision authorities that are credible, strong, independent and subject to democratic control: authorities that are not limited to meekly repeating the slogans emanating from national governments. What does it mean to say that they are European? It means that they must have real power to ban the sale of toxic products; it means that they have real power to put an end to the regulatory distortions that prevent the market from working; it means that they must have real power to require national supervisors to always operate in defence of European interests. National supervisors cannot be feudal lords invested with absolute power. The European authority must ensure that the law is obeyed, that national authorities do what they need to do when there is a threat of pandemic, and that they are able to resolve conflicts when colleges of supervisors do not want to do so, or cannot. They need to be able to require private institutions that are offside to do what they need to do when national colleges of supervisors notice any omissions within the European guidelines. The second lesson is that, among cross-border institutions, there is a special, singular type: those known as systemic institutions. An elementary truth about capitalism is that when it is done well, money is made, and when it is done badly, money is lost. This governs everything except systemic institutions. When things are going well, they make a fortune, and when things are going badly, it is the taxpayer who has to run to their aid. To resolve the problem of systemic institutions, there are only two solutions, only two: either supervisors within the countries where they operate are given greater powers to control their solvency and liquidity, which would lead to the removal of the European Parliament from the equation, or truly European institutions are put in place, which is what this House is proposing. This means that European authorities need to watch over these institutions with particular zeal, as their ruin will be the ruin of all. It means that the European institution needs to be provided with resolution and control mechanisms for stabilising endangered institutions, if this is possible, or to wind them up, if this is not possible. Lifeboats should be made ready before the voyage, not in the middle of a storm. Also, these systemic institutions need to be required to pre-finance, to provide funds for guaranteeing the interests of depositors, which is our main concern, and for paying the costs of a crisis when it occurs. What cannot happen is for the taxpayer to have to carry the can again. What cannot happen, as the Americans say so often, is for ‘Main Street’ to have to pay for the excesses of ‘Wall Street’ again. I would ask the ladies and gentlemen of the Council who are absent today – they have been very active this morning, talking on the telephone, and it seems that the storm has passed and things are calm, and they are still not here – to convey the same message through the Commissioner. The Council has asked for time. Parliament has given it time. Let nobody be confused, however: this is not a sign of weakness. This is a sign of the strength of this House. The strength of a body that believes in what it says, and feels that it has the support of the public, who back it. The Council and the Commission, which is doing a magnificent job, needs to make use of this time to forge a parliamentary consensus on the European direction, in the direction of Europe. It must not make use of this time to try and put together blocking minorities in opposition to Parliament. I ask the Council to listen to Cassandra for once. Today, Cassandra is the rapporteurs who have spoken. Cassandra is also Commissioner Barnier. Those who are not Cassandra know only too well to whom I refer. Listen to Parliament, seek an agreement, say here what was said in Toronto. Do not say one thing here and another there. As old Castilians say, if the Council does this, God will reward it, and if not, God will demand it. God and this House. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, please inform the Council that there is a convergence of opinions in this House that is rarely seen. The Council must take note: for six months, it has been telling us that it had a fixed mandate from the Swedish Presidency, and now we also have a mandate. While we are talking about Cassandra, the important thing is not to prophesise the past, which is what the Spanish Presidency did, but to prophesise the future, which is what the Belgian Presidency seems to want to do. We have a consensus that is just as strong as the one within the Council, with an added advantage, which is that the winds favour Parliament’s stance and do not favour the old and anachronistic stance that the Council maintained up until the start of the Belgian Presidency. We have the advantage that we incorporated proposals that had been rejected; proposals that were in the de Larosière report, such as the resolution mechanisms to which Mrs Ferreira has referred. It makes no sense to put in place a supervisor that can forecast the weather but cannot do anything in the case of shipwreck. We have the advantage that we anticipated things that other institutions said later. When we talked about systemic institutions, we were told that there was no such species; the European Council acknowledged its existence in March. When we talked about how the taxpayer should not have to bear the cost of the crisis and that pre-financed funds should be established by the sector for facing up to its responsibilities, we were told that this was premature, utopian or simply idiotic. Then, the Europe 2020 strategy adopted by the Commission said it, Ecofin said it, the European Council said it and took it to Toronto, and I would not understand why they are not advocating it now.

Mr President, I would like to talk about financial supervision, which is the only real tangible manifestation of this ethereal idea that we call economic governance, and I must say that we are in a real ceremony of confusion. Just this morning, the rotating President of the Union declared that we are close to an agreement. He urged us to get moving, and both these statements are economical with the truth. We are not close to an agreement, and it is also not the job of the Presidency of the Council to tell the rest of us to get moving. What it needs to do is to get itself moving, and I will tell you in which direction it needs to go. The Council agreement is, as has been said here, an agreement of minimums; it is an agreement that is wanted by some European authorities whose only competences are to propose technical harmonisation rules for a standard interpretation of European law. There was no need to go to so much trouble. This could have been done by the Commission with Article 290, based on the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, which is in force. What Parliament has said is as follows: firstly, that pan-European banks must be supervised by a genuinely European authority that is strong and subject to control by Parliament; secondly, that the banks whose collapse could drag us all down should be subject to special vigilance; thirdly, that when one of these banks gets into difficulties, the banking authority should have a toolbox to prevent infection, restructure the bank and liquidate it in an orderly fashion without the debris landing on the taxpayers’ heads; and fourthly, that there should be two funds pre-financed by the sector itself, in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, so that we do not end up all paying once again for what Crispin charitably called the irrational exuberance of a few. Mr Barroso, the first time that I saw a high representative of the Spanish Government was on Monday. Before the start of the Spanish Presidency, they were given ...

Madam President, I am going to keep to my time limit and be very specific. I am going to tell the Council and the Commission exactly what they need to do in a week’s time if they want an agreement on the financial package. The major premise is that the future is looking brighter than it was a while ago, but there are still some clouds on the horizon. According to the International Monetary Fund, USD 800 billion are owed in losses not disclosed by the banks, and the international bank has lent USD 2.2 billion to southern economies that are at risk. The reform of the financial markets needs to happen now, because what is important is not that there might be a crisis – which there might be – but that we have put the measures in place to navigate it. The second premise is that there are significant disagreements between the Council and Parliament with regard to the European supervision package. Parliament wants the entities that could cause the system to collapse and endanger the real economy to be supervised more strictly by a genuinely European authority. That is economic governance. We also want mechanisms to be established now to remodel the entities that could cause the whole system to collapse. This is not about rescuing them, but about remodelling them and, if necessary, liquidating them without spreading the infection or rescuing them as a result, as it is always the same people who pay for this. Thirdly, the ‘polluter pays’ principle requires the sector to establish a fund to pay the costs of the crisis. The Council has a week to do what the Larosière report said and to reach an agreement in Parliament; if not, the rotating Presidency of the Council will be entirely responsible. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, Commissioner, we know a number of things. We know that this crisis has been like a mutating virus: it began as a property crisis, later becoming a banking crisis, then an economic crisis, and ended up as a sovereign debt crisis that could bring other crises in the sector in its wake. We also know that this crisis has been very expensive. According to your services, aid commitments to the financial sector total EUR 3.5 billion: in other words, one third of the EU’s gross domestic product. We also know that one of the root causes of the crisis was the lack of transparency in products, institutions and markets. That is why the report that we are discussing at the moment is so important. However, if you want a statistic, I would remind you that in the United States alone, in the years 2000-2006, asset-backed securities increased by a factor of four and mortgage-backed securities by a factor of seven; moreover, in a very recent court appearance, the advisors of a reputable bank said that they did not have a very good idea of what they were selling. We also know – and this is the third statement – that many of the commitments that we made at the G20 have not gone, to quote a Spanish poet, ‘from the Muses to the theatre’ – they have not gone from imagination to the written word. We also know that throughout this remodelling of the financial sector, there are three principles which I see as key: Pan-European entities must be supervised by pan-European authorities; we must have the necessary measures at our disposal to detect the virus and avoid infection; and, finally, we must prevent the public from having to pay by itself for those infections that it has not caused. Commissioner, you have a major job to do if we do not want the next crisis to catch us with our pants down. I will end by saying in French that I recommend ‘de l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace
’ in your mission – boldness, more boldness and forever boldness. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I am going to try to say two new things on the subjects with which the European Council has been dealing: the 2020 strategy and the regulation of the financial markets. As regards the 2020 strategy, all of us here have been saying for quite some time that one of the reasons for the relative failure of the Lisbon Strategy was that there were not enough tools to oblige Member States to honour their commitments. Now the Commission and the European Council are coming to us with a proposal that is more of the same: a weak agreement that makes reference to Articles 121 and 136 of the Treaty. The President-in-Office of the Council began the Spanish Presidency by saying that he was aware of this weakness and that he wanted more: that he wanted to strengthen economic governance. I ask you now, Mr President of the European Council: ‘Where are the courtly gallantries? The deeds of love and high emprise, In battle done?’ What has happened to these intentions? As regards financial regulation, I have one piece of bad news and two of good news. The bad news is that the Council has decided to delay the regulation of alternative investment funds – known as casino capitalism – at precisely the time when these funds have been partly responsible for the speculation on the Greek economy. The first piece of good news is that the 2020 strategy talks about obliging financial institutions to put money aside to pay for some of the plates they smash; or, as President Obama would put it, to avoid Main Street having to pay for the damage caused by Wall Street. The second is that for the first time the Council is singling out the systemic institutions to which it wishes to pay particular attention. These two things feature in the reports that Parliament is currently debating. They do not feature in the agreement that the Council reached in December. I would like to see the Council taking these two ideas up again, because then we will be much closer to playing ball. Believe me, Mr President, I am really keen to play ball with the Council that you are chairing. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
).  
– (ES)
 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are more aware than anyone of how my party wanted to help make the Spanish Presidency a success. We want to continue doing so, but for that you need to make some adjustments and you need to get on with leading the Union right away. Leading the Union means seeking a solution for Greece. Everyone has said so and I am not going to repeat it. Leading the Union means approving the Directive on alternative investment fund managers as soon as possible and not delaying it, which is what the Spanish Presidency has done. Leading the Union means approving the financial surveillance package as soon as possible, not upholding at all costs a Council agreement that is much more conservative than the Commission’s proposal and even more so than the de Larosière report from which it derives. Parliament will provide the Spanish Presidency with a supervision agreement that can be summarised in two words: more supervision and more Europe. I am sure that the Spanish Government, which has always preached these ideas, will support Parliament and not the other positions that originate from the other side of the Channel. Leading the Union means strengthening budgetary discipline, and strengthening budgetary discipline means coming up with new ideas to strengthen the preventive aspect. The Spanish Prime Minister knows that the review of the fourteen stability plans that have just been referred to was a purely bureaucratic procedure in the absence of a better idea. The preventive arm would have to take into account the competitiveness of the economies – because without wealth, there is no way of balancing the public accounts – and it would have to take the foreign account situation into consideration. Tougher sanctions would also have to be implemented so that the agreement really appears binding. Leading the Union means bringing in a new idea on the issue of governance, on which you have just written in a newspaper. The Spanish Prime Minister told us here how he wanted more governance when Articles 121 and 136 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which are the ones to which the Spanish Presidency now refers, are already in force. What else does it involve? Tell us what it involves and we will help you. In order to help you, however, we need to know what it is you expect and want, because in this House, vague, vacuous and empty ideas get very short shrift. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, we are here for the first time in the history of the euro to talk about the financial situation of a handful of countries. I am emphasising the word ‘countries’, because the Spanish Presidency sounded like it was talking about outer space, and Commissioner Almunia only mentioned Greece. I would like to know whether the Commissioner continues to maintain in his closing speech that the problems of Spain and Portugal are similar to those of Greece and if so, what he would do about it. However, we are here to talk about these financial situations because the finances of a few could ruin the credibility of the currency of all and open the door to a two-speed Europe. The gap could increase when the exit strategy referred to by the Spanish Presidency is implemented, because we could find that the less developed countries have to deal with monetary difficulties and harsher monetary policies and, more importantly, have to use much more money to pay off debts and much less money to create employment. Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, without a sustainable economy, it will be impossible to balance finances. Without employment, tax revenue will continue to fall and unemployment benefit payouts will continue to rise. We are facing a crisis of confidence, and when there is a crisis of confidence, the first thing we have to do is tell the truth. We have to say how we have ended up here. What are the affected countries doing to get themselves out of debt? Are the stability pacts credible or not? Above all, we need to know what they are doing to straighten out their economies, because as I said before, without sustained growth, there will not be a sustainable economy or sustainable finances. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with many of the points that have been made, but must qualify some others. I agree that it is too soon to take away the patient’s crutches, but that it is time to get him ready to walk without them. We still have to absorb excess liquidity in the markets, correct the imbalance in public finances and re-establish respect for competition rules. In Pittsburgh we must do several things that we cannot do alone: we have to set up early warning mechanisms that work, because those that we had did not work; we have to revise the regulatory framework, because the existing framework has not worked. I agree that it is important to regulate bonuses and tax havens. These are all necessary, but inadequate, measures. In my opinion, it is more important to re-build the muscle of financial institutions, limit debt and set up reserves in good times so that we can weather the bad times. It is more important to make an effort in terms of supervision. The Commissioner knows that I supported the de Larosière report, although I felt it was inadequate, because I would support more centralised supervision. However, it is clear that European supervision cannot function without close coordination with the supervisory authorities of the other major economic areas of the world. We also need to do something about trade. It is all well and good helping the emerging countries, but it is more important to lift the barriers that are still preventing trade in goods. Commissioner, the most important point is that we need to establish the foundations for stable and sustained growth over a generation. For this we need free markets, markets open to innovation, markets open to entrepreneurs, but also markets subject to a certain level of regulation. I will end with a quotation, which will be familiar to my compatriot Mr Almunia: ‘Publish not many edicts; when you do enact pragmatics and decrees, see that they be good ones and, above all, that they are well observed’, so said Don Quixote to his friend Sancho. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again the defence of the general interest by the Commission and Parliament is clashing with entrenched national self-interest in the Council. Given the prior acceptance of the legitimacy of both positions, it is essential to find a balance. There is absolutely no doubt as to the relevance of the next multiannual financial framework. The Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and I, on its behalf, must reiterate that the Presidency’s proposal is, in our opinion, unacceptable. A cut of EUR 75 billion in relation to what was already an inevitably meagre proposal from the European Commission is futile and of no use to anyone. That is not the only problem: these new direct cuts in the agricultural and cohesion policies go beyond the ‘red line’ that Spain drew at the start of this work. Ladies and gentlemen, now is not the time to debate a supposed dichotomy between austerity and growth. Some of us are making clear efforts and sacrifices to correct our deficit. Spain, however, like so many other countries, needs to grow, increase its economic activity and create jobs. With this budget, none of this will be possible; it is pushing us past breaking point. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot achieve more Europe with far fewer resources, especially if what we have is distributed unfairly. If that is the case, Spain will oppose a multiannual financial framework for the European Union that means, plain and simple, the end to any opportunities for growth and, above all, any remnant of solidarity, and that is precisely the direction that the European Council is taking. Luckily, that is not the path that the Commission has chosen, and I must thank it for its efforts to adapt a different approach. In relation to this point – the need for the Union, the need for combined efforts – I want to thank Mr Barroso who, the other day in Cadiz, made a convincing declaration regarding the interpretation of the Treaties in the case of any potential secession within the Union.  He stated clearly and unequivocally, as guardian of the Treaties, that if part of a Member State secedes and becomes an independent state it will be dealt with as a third country and, therefore, it will be in no way affected by the statements and the effects of the Treaty. I hope, Mr President, that this can be recognised and that the Commission’s sure and steady approach can remain alive as a guarantee for us all. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Eppink that he has just used the little time he had to dish out words of insult and condemnation from a position of absolute ignorance.  Is he familiar with the Spanish Constitution? Because all Vice-President Vidal Quadras said – nothing more and nothing less – was that the provisions of the Spanish Constitution should be enforced; anything else was merely the personal comments of an individual, which had no bearing on anything and which I respect as such, but with which I do not agree. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

– (ES) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is an old principle that has passed from the legal to the political world and it is ‘pacta sunt servanda
’, which means ‘agreements must be kept’.  By that, I am referring to the important measures adopted by the European Council in June to put an end to the crisis in which we find ourselves. Since these agreements were adopted, market pressure has eased, with markets welcoming decisions capable of breaking the vicious circle between banks and sovereign debt, as well as plans to move towards a genuine economic and monetary union and the commitment to defend the euro at all costs.  Ladies and gentlemen, the European Council held last week undeniably achieved some positive results: satisfactory progress was made towards a banking union, while the agreement between the 27 Member States on the creation of a single supervisory mechanism is also to be welcomed; and it is right that this task should be entrusted to the euro area finance ministers. However, I must criticise the biased interpretations that have, unilaterally, been made in this respect. It is not acceptable to make personal interpretations that could misrepresent the mandate granted to the finance ministers, nor do we approve of describing as settled matters that were not even discussed.  We urgently need to move towards a real single supervisory mechanism that covers all financial institutions. A joint deposit guarantee scheme and a crisis resolution mechanism must also be implemented. The euro’s survival depends on the rapid creation of an effective banking union. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, it has been said that, in order for things to get better, sometimes the chaos needs to get worse. The feeling of powerlessness was such that Europe was forced to react, and it did so for the good of everyone, because the big winner of this summit was the euro. This triumph has revived the hope that Europe is emerging from its paralysis, moving from thought towards action. Ladies and gentlemen, it was essential to adopt short-term measures at this summit, in order to guarantee financial stability, along with long-term measures, in order to solve the Union’s shortcomings. In this case, immediate action was essential in order to continue working towards what is important. The imperative result was to send a message that the euro is a joint, irrevocable and irreversible project. Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome such important decisions as giving the European Stability Mechanism the facility to recapitalise banks directly, which will break the vicious circle between banking debt and sovereign debt; incidentally, the current Spanish Government has always advocated this theory. It will also help in terms of intervening in markets to support the public debt of the countries that are fulfilling their public deficit and reform commitments. These decisions were necessary in order to guarantee financial stability, which must be the European Union’s highest priority in the short term. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the time for some countries to resort to nationalist maxims and throw up obstacles. As I have already said, it is the time to support Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, Spain is providing and implementing, in record time, the most ambitious reform agenda in the history of Spanish democracy, which includes major employment reforms. It is also carrying out a financial reform, based on complete transparency, all of which demonstrates its commitment to fiscal consolidation and hitting its deficit targets. We also welcome the decision to launch a process for greater economic integration, using four building blocks: banking union, fiscal union, a common economic policy framework and enhanced democratic legitimacy. Mr President, the history of first the Community and then of the European Union has always shown that, not only do we overcome crises, but also we emerge from them stronger. I am delighted that, once again, we have achieved this. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, the first thing I should say is that the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) approves of and supports the two packages that have been presented today, both the employment package and the solidarity aid for Greece, which is consistent with your overall proposal. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no denying that we are experiencing difficult times, and daily events remind us that the crisis is still far from over. Unavoidably, the focus has shifted back to Spain. Alarm bells have been ringing in the markets, without justification, partly fuelled by statements that I consider to be inappropriate, Mr President. Some of those have been made in the context of important elections, in which opponents on both sides are making my country a dialectical element of their confrontation. Naturally, we do not welcome any of these references. Furthermore, as a way of turning the attention away from their own problems, others are showing little political sensitivity in their dealings with us. Today in Parliament, some have failed to show any finezza
, as the Italians would say, and there has been a lack of political tact. Ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the markets does not reflect Spain’s strength. We are a solvent country and we are entirely capable of tackling our debts. The Spanish debt remains below the European average, and the Spanish Government is fully committed to fulfilling the deficit targets agreed with the EU. Mr Swoboda, Mr Rajoy has never said that he cannot meet the targets set by the European Union. On the contrary, he said that he is ready to meet each and every one of those targets, and he repeats that on a daily basis. The Spanish Government, in the few months it has been in office, has adopted, and will continue to adopt, very ambitious measures in order to guarantee fiscal consolidation and lay the foundations for greater competitiveness, job creation and growth. In the outlook it made public yesterday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) itself admitted that the forecast was made prior to any analysis of the decisions and measures currently being taken by the Spanish Government. We have adopted other measures: the general State budget for 2012, which we believe will guarantee that we will meet the deficit target this year; the organic law on budgetary stability; a reform of the education and health care systems, which will be presented this month and allow for an adjustment of EUR 10 billion; and the reform of the financial sector, which is going to help the financial institutions to bring in more than EUR 50 billion. In short, Spain is meeting the targets set by the Commission, and we are calling on everyone to be responsible. We all need to find a way out of this together, Spain with everyone else, without a doubt; the criticisms being made are not at all helpful. Either all the countries find a way to act together to bring about growth and a new direction, or else it will be difficult for us to move forwards under the conditions proposed by the Commission.

 Mr President, Mr Romeva, would you like Mr Rajoy to speak in Parliament? I think that is a good idea, and I would have no objections. Mr Rajoy, however, is not the protagonist of this crisis. The protagonist of the crisis is the legacy left behind by the socialist, communist and green left-wing parties in Spain, who handed over the worst legacy in political history, and this was after they had been handed the best legacy ever left by any previous government.

Madam President, Commissioner Kallas, I would like to begin by saying that if this issue has seemed easy, if it is reaching a successful conclusion, it is due in great part to the dedicated, rigorous and flexible position of the rapporteur, Mr Fleckenstein. I would like to thank him, on behalf of my group, for being flexible enough to accept our points of view and getting us to the point where we almost have a consensus. Ladies and gentlemen, the history of the European Maritime Safety Agency is a success story. Day after day, it justifies its existence and the reason for its existence. The amendment to the regulation establishing EMSA does not seek to rectify errors; on the contrary, it aims to extend the agency’s competences in the light of new challenges and the emergence of new problems, and we believe that EMSA is the appropriate instrument for tackling and resolving those problems. Parliament wants to make sure that EMSA does not turn into a body with a life of its own, but continues to be guided by the Commission and continues to intervene at the request of the Commission itself or the Member States. The serious accident in the Gulf of Mexico has shown us that EMSA should be entrusted with helping the states to investigate accidents involving maritime, coastal or offshore installations. On a separate note, it is important to emphasise EMSA’s role in supporting the monitoring of the organisations recognised as classification societies, particularly as regards ensuring mutual recognition. It should be noted that the agency plays a key role in Port State Control and the fight against piracy. For the first time, the report makes explicit reference to the agency’s work involving the satellite-based monitoring of fishing vessels and ships fishing in dangerous waters, for example, through its close collaboration with Operation Atalanta. It is vital to comply with the environmental strategy and support EMSA assistance when necessary. As regards the composition of the Administrative Board, I believe that there should be a gender balance and that this should be stated in a recital. I think that it would be excessive to introduce it in an article. I also believe that it would be feasible to promote maritime training and exchanges of good practices among institutions and schools. We will not support the European network of training academies as each Member State has its own special characteristics and needs. Finally, Madam President, regretfully we have to vote against Amendments 18 and 41 because the aim is to exclude the word ‘national’. That is something that is neither ingenuous nor innocent. No one and no state, especially in these times when we are giving up sovereignty in return for economic efficiency, is prepared to accept that the word ‘national’, the existence of the states, should not be compatible, as indeed it should, with the existence of the Union of 27, soon to be 28.

Madam President, Commissioner, as you know, in 2008, Parliament roundly rejected the motion for a resolution that was presented to it. Later, in the same terms, the report that I myself presented to the Chamber was approved by a comfortable majority, with a great consensus and with the effort of the Commission and the political groups. What were the reasons behind Parliament’s change of mind? Undoubtedly, seeing that all the requirements involved in accepting the use of these scanners were fulfilled, including the preservation of fundamental rights and, among these, in particular, the passenger’s dignity and privacy, non-discrimination, protection of personal data and protection of health. In this way, we established what type of scanners were suitable for guaranteeing passengers’ security, on the one hand, and preserving their rights in full, on the other. The scanners will not use ionising radiation, they will not be mandatory for Member States, nor for citizens, and they will all protect the rights described above. True, the Commission has captured all of these concerns in its proposed legislation but, in addition to scanners that use stick figures, it includes the possibility of another type which, whilst guaranteeing the same catalogue of rights, permits the inspection of an image of the passenger, albeit blurred. We accept the reasons why it has proven necessary to include this alternative as an authorised method of control. Parliament also defends the need to guarantee fair competition and thus avoid any monopolistic temptation. However, today we call on the Commission to retain all the precepts that we defended in my report, all the guarantees of preservation of fundamental rights. Moreover, we encourage it to work with industry and the Member States in order to ensure that in the near future, only automatic protection scanners are used and that no inspector is needed to view any image.

 I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Fidanza, for an excellent report and for his good work in bringing on board the many ideas that have been put forward in this House to make European tourism a key asset of our economy. Tourism constitutes one of the Union’s largest sources of revenue, and in my country, Spain, it is essential to have a sound tourism policy that continues to attract tourists from across the world and helps to foster economic growth at a time of crisis. The European Parliament has, for the first time, expressed itself politically on this subject, and it has done so by supporting the work of the Commission, but also by setting forth new ideas that enrich future tourism policy following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon. It is not a question of harmonising, as this is precluded by Article 195 of the Treaty, but of supplementing national policies to improve service quality, to couple the ‘Europe brand’ with national brands, and to create budget lines that reinforce national policies. With a view to countering seasonality in the sector, I have helped boost the role of social tourism, paying particular attention to tourism for the elderly on the basis of the Spanish experience. I considered it fundamental to support small and medium-sized enterprises and to develop entrepreneurship in the industry, as a driving force for employment. The goal is to consolidate Europe’s image and visibility as a collection of sustainable, quality destinations, and to foster the competitiveness of the European tourist industry. In a global world where new markets are emerging, Parliament has an undeniable opportunity to maintain Europe’s status as the primary tourist destination in the world and to contribute to economic growth by bringing different cultures closer together.

 Mr President, we are all part of a whole, and nobody can survive alone. This emergency requires a joint effort and sacrifice. It is now being demanded that the Union show leadership, and that the mechanisms for governing and decision-making function in real time. The monetary union cannot survive without unambiguous political leadership. It needs economic governance, a common budget, a certain level of fiscal harmonisation and an emergency plan. Therefore, we first need to regulate public accounts, correct macroeconomic imbalances and stimulate competitiveness. No country should spend more than its economic growth allows. On the other hand, the intergovernmental nature of the financial stability mechanism is regrettable. The European Union needs a permanent crisis resolution mechanism under the Community method: a European Monetary Fund. If Europe wants to see leadership, ladies and gentlemen, then those decisions must be driven by Parliament and the Commission, rather than by the Council, which is hindered and slowed down by the national governments. It is the responsibility of Member States to do their homework in order to help with the decisions of the Union as a whole, and to do all they can to succeed in this vital task: achieve economic growth and create employment. More than one year ago in Spain, the leader of the Popular Party, Mr Rajoy, expressed his support in the Spanish Parliament for a specific amendment to our constitution. Moreover just last week, the Spanish Parliament and Senate reached an agreement on the matter, after Prime Minister Zapatero gave his formal support. The commitment to cleaning up public accounts cannot be an interim measure, ladies and gentlemen; it has to be permanent. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
),

 This report on audit policy, as its title states, aims to analyse lessons from the crisis. Given that one of the causes of that crisis was a loss of trust, which is the most important value for developed economies, with this resolution the European Parliament is proposing to strengthen that trust by means of auditing companies. This report is the result of a convergence of opinions; these may have been divided at the outset, but they have succeeded in establishing clear rules to strengthen the role of auditors. Nevertheless, instead of changing the market structure by penalising some of the major companies, the decision was taken to guarantee free competition and give greater support to small and medium-sized enterprises so that they can establish themselves in the market. On that point, may I congratulate Mr Masip Hidalgo for the work he has carried out in the Committee on Legal Affairs. This is an ambitious report that is going to require considerable development in order to accommodate everything that has been suggested. There were many lessons to be learned from the crisis, and this is a clear example of Europe’s will to draw the necessary impetus from the crisis in order to implement the mechanisms able to restore faith in the global economy. Audit policy is one of those. Luis de Grandes Pascual,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is an honour to defend this own-initiative report. While it was initially intended that it would be limited to security scanners, the recent increase in terrorist activity demanded that the report go further. As a result, the Committee on Transport and Tourism unanimously agreed to make me the rapporteur so as to ensure that the report would take an integral view of civil aviation security. In keeping with that mandate, the report assesses security scanners, the decisions adopted regarding liquids, aerosols and gels, and security measures on cargo and mail. Transport security, ladies and gentlemen, is one of the main concerns in the fight against terrorism. Currently, Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 describes the different aspects which are included in the points of this report. In the area of security scanners: as is set out in the explanatory statement, this report derives from the Commission’s 2008 draft regulation. This proposal, if you recall, was rejected by Parliament for not demonstrating that it fulfilled a series of requirements such as respect for fundamental rights, safeguarding health and protecting passenger data. Therefore, the Commission has resolved, and I hope it will continue to do so, all the doubts that Parliament raised and which I have identified and dealt with in this report. With regard to the protection of fundamental rights, the new-generation security scanners comply with all the necessary requirements: human dignity, respect for privacy, non-discrimination and the guarantee of a high level of protection of human health in the definition and exercise of all European Union policies and actions, all of which are included in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. The systems in place are not usually those presented in the news or newspapers by critics of security scanners. The proposed systems do not show the human body, but rather a stick figure, a mannequin, a photograph of the fully-clothed passenger or simply an ‘OK’ in green when the passenger passes through without activating the alarm. In the area of data protection: data protection is an issue that is also under constant review, and is guaranteed by new scanner technology. This makes it possible for data to be automatically destroyed once the purpose for which it is collected has been achieved. With regard to body images, ladies and gentlemen: no body images will be produced. This is one of the basic points on which the vast majority agreed, without doubt because it affects privacy as a fundamental right that cannot be eroded. In the area of public health protection: the maximum guarantee has been given by Parliament. Ionising radiation, because of its harmful effects, whether through cumulative or long-term effects, has been made obsolete by another type of technology that does not affect passenger health. Therefore, Parliament is sending a clear message and saying ‘no’ to the use of X-rays. To summarise, ladies and gentlemen, security scanners are not perfect but they are, without doubt, more effective than simple metal detectors. They bring added value and can detect dangerous objects and items that conventional scanners cannot detect. They are a tool providing measures that are proportional to the risk they are trying to prevent. They will be optional and not compulsory for Member States, but those States that do introduce them should implement harmonised, minimum standards for everyone. They will not be compulsory for travellers, but those who refuse to use them will be obliged to submit to alternative procedures which are at least as effective as the security scanners. With regard to liquids: I am not going to refer to them as there will be a debate with the Commissioner, and two objectives have already been set: there is the unfulfilled objective of 29 April 2011, on which we are awaiting reports, and the guarantee that this will be met in 2013. The European Civil Aviation Conference guarantees that technology exists which is capable of detecting liquid explosives. Therefore, this report reaffirms that Parliament’s mandate must be implemented if everything is ready. It is clear that the first objective has not been met and, therefore, as I have already said and I repeat, we are awaiting the Commissioner’s comments. In the area of cargo and mail: the recent attacks carried out on passenger planes have led the European Union to develop a more ambitious plan and to act quickly to identify additional necessary measures. I support the idea that security and screening systems have to be proportional and equivalent. Goods transported on planes must be screened, particularly if 70% of cargo is transported on passenger planes. In this regard, I welcome the support of all the groups for raising the level of cargo security, as I proposed. To conclude, Mr President, all of the issues which are included in this report on aviation security are a response to previous terrorist acts, which is why, over the coming years, the European Union will endeavour to establish a security system that prevents and avoids future attacks. I particularly wish to thank all those who worked together to enable a very difficult and complex issue, which was initially rejected by Parliament, to reach this plenary session today – thanks to the Commission’s new attitude and the flexibility shown by the political groups – with widespread support and broad consensus. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his cooperation and dialogue. The Commission called on Parliament, and the Commission will take up the relay. The next steps are the Commission’s responsibility. We await the Commissioner’s comments. Luis de Grandes Pascual,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, this time I will try to be brief and comply with your instructions. Commissioner, thank you very much for your attitude and for being receptive to Parliament’s report. We may presume from what you have said that you value and take on board many of our assessments. I say ‘our’ because this report is not only mine; rather it brings together a broad consensus, and that is positive. I would add that I am going to try to maintain that consensus up to the very last minute. Mrs Lichtenberger, we are going to accept your second amendment, because I believe it is beneficial to the area of training. With regard to your first amendment, I will try to ensure you do not have the same reservations over the issue of the name given to the scanners, because nobody gets them confused. I know that you mean well, but I would be grateful if you could withdraw the amendment. If not, then you are within your rights and I shall respect that, of course. With regard to the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I believe it will be necessary to look at them in greater detail; I very much regret that I do not agree with the principles of your amendments. These amendments are not fundamental, and I sincerely believe that there is an underlying intention to vote against them, which I regret. In any case, I would say earnestly to Mr Hénin, and I am sorry he is not here, that in a democratic society there are no grounds that legitimise any terrorist action. No political cause nor apolitical cause: terrorism must be flatly rejected in a democratic society. With regard to the amendments tabled by the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, and I am sorry that Mrs Foster is not here, for she is always very kind, I believe these are unnecessary because what they are seeking to achieve in the area of profiling could cause confusion. In paragraph 4, which we are also going to improve with an amendment put forward by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament so as to elaborate on the strengthening of data protection, it is not necessary to talk about profiling as that could cause confusion and give an impression of discrimination, and I am sure that no attempt will be made to do so. We are going to accept, not just accept for consideration, the S&amp;D Group’s oral amendment, because I believe it is good and, if Parliament accepts it, we will vote in favour of it. As far as the rest is concerned, I believe that we are going to truly fulfil the mandate given to us. Commissioner, I believe we have done well so far; we have passed the baton on to you and I hope you will rise to the occasion. I am sure you will, as you have shown talent and courage, and I am grateful that you are sorry about what happened on 29 April 2011. I know you are being sincere, and I hope that in 2013 we will fulfil all the objectives in the area of liquids, as we are all trying to do. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 Mr President, it is no coincidence that Spain, Italy, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and other countries are all reluctant to accept the so-called Eurovignette. This common critical stance stems from our position as peripheral countries since, at the end of the day, it will be us who will pay this quite singular levy and the Member States enjoying a geographical location in the centre of the European Union who will collect it. The reasoning that underlies the Eurovignette is beset by major contradictions and the discourse that supports it becomes weaker every day. Even accepting the rationality of internalising external costs as a valid starting point, it is ultimately untenable to penalise heavy goods vehicles only and not ordinary cars with the aim of mitigating traffic congestion, just as the old ‘polluter pays’ principle is applied in a clearly discriminatory way. In addition to this, ladies and gentlemen, only 15% of the funds collected through the Eurovignette – which was conceived as a funding source for infrastructures – will finally be used to fund trans-European networks, and not as a requirement but merely as a recommendation. Thus, finance ministries will allocate the funds as they see fit according to the interests of their countries, within the wide sphere of infrastructures. The ultimate result will be yet another setback for road freight transport, which, the way things stand today, is the only means enabling the operation of the Internal Market. This is reality, ladies and gentlemen, a reality that is a lot starker in the context of an economic crisis. If European products are to be competitive in global markets, we cannot afford experiments that may result in even further damage to an already weak European economy by imposing yet more additional costs. Lastly, the food crisis, which has recklessly been blamed on Spanish products, has led to unfair penalties and huge losses for those penalised by the Eurovignette: freight carriers and prime crop farmers. It is for all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, that the Spanish delegation of the European People’s Party shall vote against this draft directive. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Madam President, recently, the Church of Our Lady of Salvation in Baghdad was attacked and 58 people were killed, mainly women and children, purely because they were Christians. Al-Qaeda has proudly claimed responsibility for this deed. This is not an isolated incident, but rather the culmination of persecutions of and attacks on Christians in majority Muslim countries. There have been expulsions from Morocco, threats in Turkey and attacks in India and Nigeria. In January, six Christians were massacred at the door of a church in Cairo. For how long will Western democracies collude with this by remaining silent? Fortunately, President Buzek has made a statement on behalf of Parliament. The statement by the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, condemning the attack, limited itself to condemning a terrorist act. Why is the motive not mentioned, in other words, the fact that they were Christians, which was the unequivocal reason behind the attack? I have not heard anything from Mr Zapatero, nor have I heard anything from Prime Minister Erdogan. What is the point of the Alliance of Civilisations? I am ashamed of our simple-mindedness and cowardice. I cannot help recalling the late, misunderstood Oriana Fallaci, who announced the arrival of Eurabia
 and was practically stoned for having the courage to condemn what was happening in this neurotic Europe. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, must be congratulated. We have had dissimilar, even conflictive positions, but she has found compromise solutions that allow us to stand together today on this important issue. Ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided that all the seas should be protected in a similar way, arguing that any other solution would bring about a situation of unfair competition. We accept the position of the majority in favour of a legal situation with uniform rules for the entire Union, although I will not spare Members the fact that such a solution also clearly implies a certain degree of unfairness. It is obvious that the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel are more polluted and, in my view, sulphur monitoring will have to be stricter. The measures to reduce transport time and handling costs in ports are certainly positive initiatives. Nonetheless, I will repeat this again and again: we still have work to do on this matter. Unless we liberalise our ports resolutely, they will not be able to expand the key role they will be required to play in the context of co-modality. The promotion of a CO2
 reduction strategy aimed at altering the specific consequences of climate change is also to be welcomed. I think this is a good report that must be adopted. But we must not forget that this report is in the context of a serious disaster, namely that affecting the Gulf of Mexico. In this respect, the Commission is urged to judge whether it is necessary, within the framework of revision of the Regulation of the European Maritime Safety Agency, to strengthen the role of the Agency in carrying out preventive inspections and post-hydrocarbon-spill clean-up tasks. Commissioner, this, I believe, is a necessary reform and the necessary mandate must be used to support these tasks. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mrs De Veyrac on her report, which has enabled an agreement to be reached at first reading. I must, however, make three critical observations that imply the need to make concessions whenever there are negotiations of this type. Firstly, the individual identification of victims has been dropped: when DNA allows such identification to take place, it is natural for families to demand that they be given not just any bodies but the bodies of the victims to whom they are related. Secondly, the term ‘causes’ has not been replaced by ‘concurrent factors’. This is going to be a source of litigation, and I believe it is a serious error – and if not, time will tell – as the technical investigation needs to be separated from the legal investigation. Finally, we find it deeply regrettable that the Spanish delegation may ultimately have to abstain, regardless of its favourable opinion on the subject. This is, quite simply, because the relationship with Gibraltar Airport, which is now governed by the Ministerial Statement agreed in Cordoba in 2006, has been mentioned since 1987. Previously, the legislation was suspended and reference was made to the differences between the United Kingdom and Spain, and now three references are made to those legal differences, and nothing more. This, of course, means that we will have to abstain, regardless– I repeat – of our favourable opinion of the report and of the work done by Mrs De Veyrac. Once again, I would like to praise her for a good report that will be fundamentally positive. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, I would have liked to have made a different speech today, believe me. You set out six months full of ambition, and set the bar so high with your claims that, when these are compared with what was actually achieved, disappointment was inevitable. What is certain is that you have not been able to overcome a complex situation for which you lacked leadership and credibility. You yourself pointed out once that the European Union is a club with rules and I agree. However, it was up to you to demand obedience to these rules. The reality is that it was the government of Spain that urgently needed to fulfil its obligations. Within this context, positive achievements, whilst not lacking, have been undistinguished. Unlike me, you have had time to talk about them. Democracy is a public opinion-based system. This is how it seems: President Obama’s disdain, as well as the cancellation of the Mediterranean Summit and the one announced between the European Union and the United States, constitute very significant failures. The rush to reach improvised agreements at any cost has not helped the image of Spanish management: as a way of achieving a respectable objective, it could be described as amateurish. Spain is a great nation, and will continue to be one, despite the poor management of this period. Our diplomats and officials have kept a stiff upper lip and, thanks to this, Spain’s prestige will survive. The truth is that the situation in Spain will count for more within the value judgment that will be made of this Presidency than what was done or not done here. Someone who has taken his country into a phase of uncertainty and unrest would have difficulty in providing leadership for an enterprise this difficult. At best, this Presidency has been sadly irrelevant. Luis de Grandes Pascual,

Mr President, Mr Kallas, this is a directive that affects all customs formalities that apply to ships arriving in or departing from ports. Thus, it will favour short-distance maritime transport and will contribute to modal balance. The aim, ladies and gentlemen, is to reduce and simplify the amount of information and number of documentation and physical controls carried out by ships with respect to goods. At present, this information must be provided and these controls carried out repeatedly. The attitude of the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, who I would like to congratulate for his work, has been intelligent and open to dialogue. Particularly, as a shadow rapporteur, I feel represented in the final document and satisfied that my contributions have been taken on board. This is a process that has grown with time, during the course of which agreements were gradually reached, ranging from its adoption by the Committee on Transport and Tourism to the trialogue held on 7 June. The end result has been the consensus reached between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The agreements have covered some very important issues, to which the rapporteur and Commissioner Kallas have already referred. In my opinion, the compromise solutions reached with respect to the issue of the languages used, the time limit for its entry into force, and the one-stop shop, are balanced and worthy of support. I think a good job has been done. I would like to congratulate Mr Sterckx and believe the goals set for us by the Commission have been fully met. Moreover, I feel that we should be pleased about having reached this agreement between the three parties, the three institutions. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 Mr President, in my opinion, this excellent report sets out the guidelines that must inspire the new White Paper on Transport that will shape European transport policy for the next 10 years. This report includes several issues that are worth outlining: the need for a financial fund as an essential instrument; the challenge of the growing demands of freight transport; the search for comodal solutions that make users and freight safe; the vital need for sufficient and secure rest areas for road transport; the – in my opinion, correct – diagnosis that the various modes of transport must complement each other, with efficiency criteria being sought rather than merely being in competition with each other; and the rapporteur’s – brave, in my opinion, and fair – assertion that transport by rail or sea is not always more environmentally friendly than road transport. In short, the concept of ‘efficient comodality’ is a concept for the future and it must certainly, in my opinion, be given full support. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Kallas for being here and for the work that he has done during this difficult time. This is a debate that had to take place, ladies and gentlemen, and unfortunately, I think it will not be the last of its kind. I will spare you any repeats of the statistics of this serious event and the negative impact that it has had on the economy. I simply wish to remember those who were affected. Firstly, there were the passengers. Ten million people were left without flights and with no guidance as to what to do. The impact on passengers was so great that the provisions of directives and regulations could not protect them. The exclusion of liability in contracts due to catastrophe or force majeure
 brings to mind the need for a joint fund to tackle the consequences of a global disaster such as that caused by the volcano. I now come to the airlines. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that they lost EUR 1 700 million worldwide. The Association of European Airlines (AEA) assesses the loss at EUR 850 million at European level. This blow was all that they needed to accentuate a spiralling crisis that is threatening many airlines with closure. The other victim has been tourism. The consequences for tourism have been devastating. Firstly, due to the cancellation of contracts that had been made in advance, as is usual in this sector, and secondly, due to insecurity, which has caused a change in normal booking trends. This is my diagnosis, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. There can only be one conclusion: the European institutions do not have the tools to effectively tackle a crisis of this magnitude. Now I come to the criticism, because criticism is necessary and inevitable; self-criticism, if necessary. No one can be exonerated, because everyone involved acted badly, late and inefficiently, sometimes through no fault of their own. The Member States cannot be exonerated because, although the decisions were within their competence, they were still unable to act. The European institutions cannot be exonerated because they took four long days to react, and because their reaction, which invoked safety as their priority, did not unfortunately produce calm, but paralysis. I will now discuss the Commission’s response. Today, the Commission is reiterating the measures that it had announced to us. In my view, they are reasonable measures, but there is a lack of clarity about the timescale for implementing them. We are not talking about something in the past. Even today, there is a latent threat of flights being grounded, and it is concerning that we are dependent on air currents. I know that we cannot fight the elements. This was said by a famous Spanish sailor regarding a big naval battle that we lost. The crisis will not help us to take measures. The Member States will be reluctant to provide resources. If we are mean, however, this volcano could do more damage to the European economy than is being forecast. I ask the Commission to be determined, and I ask the Council to urgently tackle the need to take decisions. I ask everyone to be generous in implementing alternatives to make up for the incapacities of the institutions. I do not hold the Commission or the Council responsible, but we need to acknowledge the diagnosis that the institutions have not been capable, as they currently stand, of solving a crisis of this magnitude and proportions.

 Mr Zapatero, for a Spaniard, such as I am, it is an honour to greet you here, as you take your turn as the President of the European Union. This is a period of many expectations and challenges and, of course, we must not fail to live up to those expectations. It is important that our citizens see that our updated institutions are capable of providing solutions to real problems. You know that we agree with the programme you have put forward. You know that, for the Spanish Partido Popular
, this is a question of state and that we will be behind you in everything that we regard as being in the common interests of Europe and that is important to Spain. It is an ambitious programme and, hopefully, a programme full of content. I hope that in this album of the Spanish Presidency – since it will surely be colourful and varied – people can see every event as a milestone in the very real problems that affect them. The crisis is hitting economies and unemployment seems like the fifth horse of the Apocalypse. You have had the honesty to recognise that there is 20% unemployment in Spain, but that does not curtail you. I believe that it obliges us all to come up with a solution to a problem that we must solve together. It is a real problem. The time available does not allow me to say too much, Prime Minister. However, I do want to tell you that Spain faces many challenges ahead, that I am certain of Spain’s capability as a nation and that I want to believe and am sure that you will rise to the challenge. At this time in Europe, we must not fail to live up to these expectations On the other hand, the globalised world – and you have referred to it with intelligence – means that new centres of power are emerging and it is necessary for the European Union to take a more active and coherent role in defence of its values and interests. Otherwise, we run the risk of becoming irrelevant. Finally, Prime Minister, we Spanish will not accept being denied the ability to make proposals. We have that right. We must also have the humility to accept the advice that Don Quixote gave to Sancho Panza when he recommended humility in his fantasy about governing the Isle of Barataria.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain has just endured a painful situation in which a vessel, the Alakrana,
 and all its crew were subjected to blackmail, humiliation and countless risks. The Spanish Government is being called to account in Spain, as is appropriate in the case. In this House, we are going to talk of Europe and more Europe. Accordingly, it has to be stated that after a year in which we have demanded diplomacy and determination, the outcome has been positive. Operation Atalanta is inadequate, however. It needs to be broadened and made more flexible. It has to become possible to protect not only the routes along which humanitarian aid moves, but also Community fishing and merchant vessels. The latter must be protected, and that is why, in the resolution to be adopted tomorrow, we shall call on the European Parliament and on its institutions to make certain commitments. What we are seeking to do is to say ‘yes’ to the strong stance taken by states that protect their vessels with their armed forces to deter and, if necessary, legally repel pirate action. We must say ‘no’ to recourse to private security contractors, a move which, according to the IMO, carries with it the risk of unnecessary violence. We must say ‘no’ to the passive and dilettante attitude of governments that are making life easy for the pirates. We must say ‘yes’, however, to diplomacy, ‘yes’ to aid to Somalia, and ‘no’ to unsubstantiated charges of alleged illegal fishing. Community vessels are fishing in compliance with our international agreements. They are doing so legally and must be protected. The Community's institutions are duty bound to do so.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank you for being here this morning and also congratulate you on the good job you have done with the publication of the Single Market Act II. I would also like to applaud the work of Ms Bastos, which is correct and certainly necessary. I believe that the 12 proposals included in the act will surely constitute a major boost to the single market, and I especially welcome the inclusion of the creation of a genuine digital single market among those priorities. This year we are celebrating 20 years of the single market: 20 years of prosperity during which as Europeans we have expanded the opportunities available to our businesses and to the public. However, if we want to continue making progress and to be able to meet the forthcoming challenges of technological changes and developments, and ensure that our economy continues to be competitive in the global market, I firmly believe that, just as in the 1980s and 1990s we developed and established the four fundamental freedoms, now the main goal we must achieve is to create a true, genuine digital single market. I know, Commissioner, due to our close cooperation over the last two years, that the digital market is a priority for you. I would like to take this opportunity to once again offer my support so that we may continue the same cooperation between the Commission and Parliament that we have had so far in order to make the digital single market a reality. Exactly two weeks ago the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the report on completing the Digital Single Market by a very large majority. I believe it is vital that both Parliament and the Commission convey to the Council the need to move forward with the recommendations in both documents and that we continue to work very closely in order to put them into effect.

Madam President, I would like to thank the three Commissioners for being here today. We are experiencing a crisis that can only be overcome by reviving trade. There is no doubt that SMEs are the pillar underpinning the European economy and there is no doubt that we need more Europe and less market fragmentation. The digital revolution offers us many possibilities, and one of these is, without any doubt, electronic commerce. An increasing number of consumers buy online, but they only do so at a national level – things are more complicated at a European level. Market barriers do not help, and electronic commerce is almost non-existent at this pan-European level. In my opinion, and I have said this several times, the way out of the crisis is digital, and the time has come to go from poetry to prose. It is time for action. Our SMEs need concrete measures to increase their pan-European options and to develop their full potential in a market of more than 500 million consumers. Consumers, meanwhile, need a pan-European market that offers sufficient guarantees to allow them to trust in a true digital single market, in which they can buy products in the knowledge that their rights are assured, with freedom of choice and at a good price. The Consumer Rights Directive is a good first step. I would like to know what next steps the Commission has in mind with regard to copyright, data protection, VAT, accounting rules, a single domain for online transactions, conflict resolution, product shipping, etc. Pablo Arias Echeverría  (PPE

 Madam President, I would just like to say a word about the Working Group on e-Commerce. Thank you very much for your answer, Commissioner. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) has a Working Group on e-Commerce, and we would like you to take part in this so that we can discuss these proposals in greater depth and find out about the specific measures, enabling the IMCO Committee to gain a proper understanding of them.

Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the communication that you have presented to us. I think it is a good initiative in order to continue working to improve the single European market. I consider it vital that the 50 proposals that you referred to in your speech be debated. I hope that in Parliament, I will be able to play an active role in helping to overcome barriers to e-commerce in Europe. Many of the current barriers to e-commerce have already been detected, and there are even specific proposals for overcoming them. We could say that we are reliant on political will to resolve those barriers. I think that this communication is a good start, and I therefore think we should support it by playing an active role. Pablo Arias Echeverría,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, as you all know, the Internet and new technologies represent an unprecedented revolution that means that we need to modernise the mechanisms that regulate e-commerce in our economy in order to be able to tackle the challenges that we are facing. Just a few years ago, the new systems for trade over the Internet, and the new technologies and opportunities we have available to us now, did not exist. They are now a fact, however, and soon they will be an essential tool. As legislators, we need to be broad-minded enough to create tools for the public that solve the problems of today, but which foresee and can be adapted to the problems of tomorrow. This is a commitment that we must make and a responsibility that we are obliged to take on. We must prepare the way for what is to come and for those who are to come, and this means we need to overcome the obstacles to achieving that goal. E-commerce is a tool available to us with enormous potential for relaunching and improving the competitiveness of our economy and also for strengthening the internal market. It is a tool that can create a great deal of added value and offer great opportunities to the European people and businesses in this time of crisis. It is vital that the leaders of the European Union implement the necessary measures to overcome the existing barriers to cross-border e-commerce in Europe and that we generate confidence in this medium, simplify it and make the rules governing it transparent. That is the only way to ensure that the public and businesses will be able to reap the rewards of its enormous potential. That is the only way that we can be competitive in a global market that waits for no one. Either we take the necessary measures energetically, decisively and with leadership, or our competitors will leave us behind. The report that I am presenting today proposes measures for overcoming the barriers to cross-border trade. We have the opportunity not only to prepare the internal market for e-commerce, but also to help to complement the internal market through e-commerce. The measures that I propose in the report are aimed at improving the quality of access to the Internet in Europe, improving consumer confidence by creating a European quality mark, increasing monitoring and supervision of the network and conducting information campaigns so that users are aware of their rights and know how and where to complain if they have problems. They are also aimed at protecting the private property and personal data of users, promoting the development of initiatives that incentivise businesses to sell their products online, improving payment systems and simplifying the rules regarding the payment of taxes, among other measures. Finally, in this plan, I felt I needed to highlight the need to improve protection for minors using the Internet. I believe that all these measures are essential for promoting e-commerce and for adapting the rules that currently govern it to a future in which we are already living. We have an obligation to offer mechanisms to the market that make our businesses more competitive and strengthen our economies. This plan is undoubtedly a platform on which we can continue to build without any obstacles or hindrances. For these reasons, I would like to ask this House for its support to move forward with this initiative. Pablo Arias Echeverría  (PPE

Mr President, we have just voted on paragraph 44, and although my vote was in favour, I put down ‘against’ because there was some slight confusion: we were told that we were voting on 45, when in reality we were voting on 44. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, we all recognise the importance of this report and the efforts made by the rapporteur to achieve a consensus, and I would therefore firstly like to congratulate Ms Thyssen. This House has called on previous occasions for the establishment of an integrated financial framework, budgetary framework and economic policy framework. At the Council in June the guidelines and roadmap were agreed, which we must now begin to follow. It is now the time to do what was agreed. The first step is banking union based on three pillars. Firstly, a single supervisor, which is the key to breaking the circle between banking debt and sovereign debt; a second pillar based on the common deposit guarantee mechanism; and a third pillar based on a common bank crisis resolution system. These are three basic pillars in order finally to begin to generate stability and confidence. In this sense, I support the European Central Bank taking on as soon as possible the powers to act as single independent supervisor over all banks, obviously with the cooperation of the national authorities. With regard to direct recapitalisation of banks, I support what was adopted at the Council in June, in which the possibility was confirmed of a direct injection of cash into the banks once the single supervisor begins operation. In addition, fiscal union is the other goal that must be achieved in the medium term, in order to achieve an authentic and genuine economic and monetary union. In the same way, as a culmination of this whole process, we should move towards some sort of mutualisation of debt, in order to put an end once and for all to the differences in interest rates due to the doubts generated regarding the euro area. What is most important in all of this is what I said at the start: to do what we have agreed, therefore I reiterate my full support for the rapporteur. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am addressing the House with the simple aim of highlighting the importance of the European Semester as a tool for detecting the weaknesses in our system and for exercising the democratic legitimacy that Parliament represents. Following the beginning of the crisis, and thanks to the implementation of these mechanisms, we are succeeding in analysing its causes in order to lay the foundations for greater EU integration, which is the only response and the only option for bringing an end to the crisis and ensuring that this type of crisis cannot happen again. The semester represents the desire for coordination that we have been so much lacking so far in order to jointly manage our needs as Europeans. The tools related to the European Semester, the Annual Growth Survey and the Country-Specific Recommendations create greater stability for all Member States and deepen their knowledge. The report, presented by Mr Gauzès, which is the result of very hard work, reflects their value. Nevertheless, we must continue to promote greater coordination between our policies until we create not only true economic union, but true political union. This does not mean that agreements do not have to be fulfilled, but must be a further incentive for the EU to speak with once voice. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by underlining my support for free trade agreements as a fundamental means of stimulating the much-longed-for and much-needed economic growth and the creation of jobs. These agreements also boost relations with our allies, in this instance Japan.  The former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama recently stated in an article in the Wall Street Journal
 that both Brussels and Tokyo had strong ties with Washington, but that the ties between Brussels and Tokyo were not so strong. I agree with him that this agreement could be an opportunity to redress this imbalance.  Nevertheless, at a time when we are considering launching negotiations to conclude a free trade agreement with Japan, I believe that the European Union’s trade strategy should be in keeping with its industrial strategy and I would like to know the Commissioner’s opinion on this point.  In addition, if we want industry’s share of GDP to rise from the current 16 % to 20 %, as proposed in the Europe 2020 agenda, it would make sense, in my opinion, to listen to the concerns of industry itself when it comes to trade policy. The automotive industry is undoubtedly of key importance in this respect. We should therefore listen to its concerns and work with it to ensure that this agreement becomes a reality as soon as possible. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE
).

Mr President, firstly, I believe it is appropriate to congratulate Commissioner Barnier on his hard work and the great passion he is putting into this project. We are again faced with a decisive moment for the euro. There can be no more delays. We have to progress towards true economic and monetary union, and ultimately, true political union. There is no going back. We will all agree that banking union is the first basic and essential step towards political union. There are three main pillars of this banking union. The first is a single supervisory authority, which supervises all banks in the euro area, and it is even more important that it comes into force as soon as possible. The second is a common deposit guarantee fund. The third is a banking crisis management mechanism. We also need the option to be able to directly recapitalise banks when required, to break, as mentioned by Commissioner Barnier, the vicious circle between banking debt and sovereign debt, and to finally overcome the debt crisis. This is the real deal. There is no going back on the euro. The Spanish Government has made a proposal, an ambitious proposal, in this respect. This was born out of the Spanish Government’s commitment to Europe and the euro. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the expected adoption of the amendments to the safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas is a key step towards Parliament adopting the two agreements with Central America, Colombia and Peru. Those agreements are essential for the future of the European Union. These clauses, along with the progress made by Colombia, acknowledged by the political resolution adopted by this House on 13 June, as well as the support of the Central American countries and Peru for this regulation, should provide the final approval for the ratification of those agreements. These clauses will allow our producers to progressively adapt to a free-trade framework that will benefit us all. At a time when the United States and Asian countries are signing free-trade agreements with American countries, such as the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) or the agreements between the United States and Colombia and Peru, respectively, we cannot allow the leading trading power in the world, the European Union, to continue to miss opportunities. In this sense, I share the concern of the European business sector at the delay in these agreements coming into force. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, almost all of us agree that the way to exit the crisis is through austerity and reforms to instigate growth. We should not fall into the false debate of austerity versus growth: austerity is a key tool and required in order to achieve the goal of economic growth. In this respect, Spain is an example, an example of a country committed to fiscal consolidation and reforms. To achieve this, Europe must focus on the formation of fiscal policy measures that will ensure austerity as well as growth and job creation, but the European Central Bank needs, more than ever, to instigate a monetary policy that allows for the acceleration of the effects of the implemented structural reforms. The ‘policy mix’ is of key importance, today more than ever. There is a need to underpin the adopted fiscal measures with a more relaxed monetary policy that means that the aforementioned measures and reforms have the quickest possible effect: over 20 million unemployed people in Europe are waiting.

 Mr Romeva, the Spanish Government has not rejected any investment in the manner you mentioned, neither is the Spanish Government against the eurobonds.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank both the European Commission and the governments of Colombia and Peru for the great efforts made to successfully reach this agreement. I give my full support to an agreement that will undoubtedly benefit both regions, both Colombia and Peru, and will help to improve human rights conditions in Colombia. This agreement is an example for a key region for the European Union, as is South America. I am concerned about another agreement, however, one that the Commission is about to start negotiating. The Commission should show that it roundly defends the legal security of the investments that are made, which are so important in improving trade flow between both parties. I would like to take this opportunity, therefore, to ask Commissioner De Gucht about the measures being considered when it comes to the Repsol YPF issue. As has been the case with the agreement with Colombia and Peru which we are debating here, the best guarantee to reach a possible successful agreement with Mercosur would be a strong and decisive response from the European Union when it comes to the Repsol case. We should not allow our allies on the other side of the Atlantic to be more robust than we are when it comes to an issue that affects Europe. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,

 Mr President, Mr Šemeta, the last European Council meeting focused on the need to improve the taxation system in order to improve tax collection efficiency and put a stop to tax evasion and tax fraud. Spain will introduce a law on this matter. The ideas that have been put forward by the Council and given expression in this resolution are priorities of Spain’s economic policy and, I am certain, that of the rest of Europe as well. They will enable us to bring about legal certainty, reduce the informal economy and lower the number of people who are not fulfilling their tax obligations; this will be sure to create a fairer Europe. Furthermore, we should bear in mind the recommendations made by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the principle of trying to eliminate or reduce to a minimum the comparative disadvantage between those who have fulfilled their taxation obligations and those who do not fulfil them. The resolution we shall vote on in plenary and the Spanish plan to prevent and combat tax fraud therefore seek to fight against the informal economy, promote transparency and European coordination, boost tax collection – enabling the deficit to be reduced, which is so badly needed at the moment – and not damage opportunities for growth but, on the contrary, create a fairer and more efficient system that reflects those opportunities. Those decisions will have a very positive impact on the public accounts and, I insist, will make a significant contribution to reducing the deficit and, therefore, to restoring growth. Finally, while we are talking about growth, I want to take this opportunity to stress that, in order to achieve the growth we so badly want, we should continue to pledge our commitment to internationalising our economy and our businesses, as the Council has stated many times. To achieve that, however, we need to guarantee the legal certainty of our investments, but I do not want to speak ahead of the debate we shall have later.

 Mr President, firstly, Ms Muñiz, the Spanish Government has not passed any tax amnesty laws because, as you are aware, that concept is not included in the Spanish constitution. It is true that the Spanish Government has proposed regularisation, as other countries such as Belgium and Germany have done, as well as other Spanish governments of your own political affiliation – that is, the Socialist Party, a few years ago.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my third speech in the House so far this year on this issue and I am sorry to stick to the same refrain but, as my fellow countryman, Miguel de Unamuno, used to say: ‘to strike the nail once, you must strike the horseshoe a hundred times’. Furthermore, I want to repeat the call to actively implement the measures that have been agreed in the last few Councils. As the President of the Commission has said, we need to finish the job. We need growth, ladies and gentlemen. With austerity, we will manage to create stability and confidence, but we also have to emerge from the crisis and create work and well-being once more. We need to commit to urgent implementation of the measures that were agreed upon in the last few Councils to incentivise growth. These measures must be accompanied by reforms. Spain is clearly committed to this spirit of reform. In less than 100 days, we have passed three key reforms: budgetary stability, financial reform and labour reform and this spirit of reform does not end here. As Mariano Rajoy says, the Spanish Government not only announces reforms, it carries them out, which is a different thing altogether. Let us follow its example. Let us not announce plans for growth, let us implement them. Furthermore, we need a degree of adaptability to circumstances given that we live in a world of constant change and evolution. As the President of the government of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, said recently before the House and as the Economy Minister, Luis de Guindos confirmed today, Spain is fulfilling its duties and will continue to do so. Spain is more committed than ever to Europe. It has demonstrated this right from the start, putting its cards on the table and standing by its desire to comply with what has been agreed.

 Mr President, Commissioner, after the Council meetings held recently, Adenauer’s statement that ‘we all live under the same sky, but we do not all have the same horizon’, appears to be losing clout in favour of the construction of this common area, the European Union. The most important issue remains, however, in that we should actively implement all the measures agreed during recent Council meetings. Up to now, the austerity measures appear to have been applied most speedily. I will insist as many times as is necessary in this plenary, however, that we are not getting anywhere by only applying austerity; we need growth. These tough but essential adjustment programmes have to go hand in hand with the necessary reforms to generate growth and employment. Up to now, Spain has been at the forefront of this comprehensive austerity and reform plan. The three major reforms that were approved – ‘budgetary stability’, ‘reform of the financial system’ and ‘labour reform’ – testify to that. These reforms have merited the acknowledgement of different governments and media, despite the obstacles being placed in their way by launching unfounded rumours. The latter began with sport and yesterday threatened to spread into our economy and our politics. Let us continue to work for the same horizon. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, congratulations on your appointment. Prime Minister, we are celebrating the decisions adopted during the last Council, but it is my hope and wish that they do not remain mere words, but that they also become actions and come to fruition as soon as possible. We must send a solid message to the markets. Up to now, they have been very welcoming of the measures. Furthermore, there is a sense of eagerness for cooperation and a spirit of willingness, both of which we will continue to have great need of over the coming months. We must maintain and continue to consolidate our efforts in favour of stability and continue to put our trust in austerity measures, but these must be accompanied by other measures to generate growth and, therefore, employment. We cannot recover from this crisis through austerity measures alone. We need to bring reforms to fruition, not just debate them. Spain is showing that it is fully committed to this idea. That is why we are supporting the structural reforms that must be implemented by the Member States. The European Central Bank, for its part, has demonstrated courage when taking decisions, but it must show greater commitment through more active participation in the secondary debt markets. Furthermore, the common financial mechanisms that have been debated at such length in this House must be implemented. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Madam President, this question is for Vice-President Tajani. We all realise how important professional mobility is in building a versatile, competitive workforce. In fact, two of the pillars of the Europe 2020 strategy are innovation and entrepreneurship. Mr Vice-President, as you know, we currently have Erasmus for undergraduates, the Marie Curie programme for researchers and Erasmus for entrepreneurs. I think it would also be necessary to design a programme to provide cross-cutting opportunities to young innovators so that they can carry out their projects not only in universities but also in companies, start-ups, laboratories or government agencies. The members of the European Parliament Youth Intergroup have put forward a proposal to undertake a project entitled ‘Young Innovators Mobility’, which sets out to achieve just that. Mr Vice-President, I would like to know whether this initiative has the Commission’s support. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Madam President, in paragraph 2 of Article 9a, after the words ‘at the request of a Member State’, we would like to add the phrase ‘any legal person or any association not having legal personality acting on behalf of the Union industry’.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner De Gucht, early in this parliamentary term, which is my first, one of the matters I first heard discussed was precisely the Free Trade Agreement with Korea. Certain sectors of European industry, especially the automotive industry, were unanimous in opposing this agreement. As a citizen of Navarre and Spain, where the automotive industry represents a substantial part of our economy, I felt the duty to become involved in order to improve, if not the agreement as this was no longer possible, the safeguard clause, which was where Parliament could introduce improvements. Thus, we set out to achieve two objectives. Firstly, to protect the industry and its jobs, and secondly, to make the agreement more attractive for the industries concerned, particularly the automotive industry. Our aim was not just to avoid outright rejection, but to gain their support for the agreement. I believe that here today, we can say ‘mission accomplished’. This is all thanks to Parliament’s hard work and expertise. I should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteurs of both reports for their outstanding work. Thank you Robert. And thank you also for your words. Recognition is also due to the members of the Committee on International Trade, led by its Chair, Mr Moreira. ¡Muito obrigado!
, Vital. I would also like to thank the Belgian Presidency of the European Union for their excellent work. Their effort has had its reward in the form of the agreement we finally reached in December. Lastly, I would like to highlight the work of the European Commission, and particularly Ignacio Bercero’s contribution, for which I am most grateful. Tomorrow we will vote in favour of a clause which will be more effective, easier to apply and will genuinely protect European industry. Today, concerns on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea have hugely diminished. Indeed, we might say that they have all but vanished. Today, the opportunities this agreement brings clearly outweigh the uncertainties. The European Parliament should be proud of a job well done. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, I would first like to clarify that I am in favour of strengthening trade links between the European Union and Papua New Guinea that promote the development of the region, but it must be sustainable development. I sincerely believe that this agreement, as it currently stands, is not a good one. I am entirely against one clause of the agreement, which I consider to be unfair: the exemption from the rules of origin, because not only does it endanger the sustainable development of Papua New Guinea, but, as we have heard here today, it endangers a whole European industry: the canning industry. This concession should have been absolutely exceptional, and it should not have been applied in the case of Papua New Guinea. Moreover, let us not forget the serious precedent that this measure is setting, and will set, for future European Union negotiations. In my opinion, there needed to be a much clearer and firmer resolution in this respect, stating categorically that, at the next review of the Interim Partnership Agreement, the exemption from the rules of origin will be permanently suspended. I therefore want to ask the Commission to take into account the dramatic consequences that this concession is going to have, firstly, for the European canning industry, and secondly, for the sustainability of the environment and natural resources of Papua New Guinea, and the very negative precedent being set for future negotiations. However much the Commission has said that it will not be a precedent, the pressure will be there. I therefore ask the Commission to decide to put an end to the exemption from the rules of origin as soon as possible. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,

Mr President, the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea will open up opportunities for both European and Korean industry, but in order to prevent any negative effects on European industry, it is essential to have an effective safeguard clause. All the political groups unanimously decided last week that the time had come for Parliament to take a position in plenary on the amendments adopted by 27 votes in favour and just one abstention in the Committee on International Trade in June, which are vital in order for the safeguard clause to be applicable and effective. As you are aware, we are going to vote solely on the amendments and, in accordance with Rule 57, we will defer the vote on the legislative report to the second part-session in October. At the same time, we unanimously decided not to close the door on a possible agreement at first reading, which we firmly believe will be possible. However, in order to do so, it is vitally important that we send a clear signal of unity and strength from all the political groups. That is why it is important for Parliament as a whole to strongly support the whole package of amendments. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea will open up opportunities for both European and Korean industry. However, in order to prevent any negative effects on European industry, it is essential to have an effective safeguard clause. That is what my colleagues and I have been working on over the past few months in the Committee on International Trade, which is why it is important for Parliament as a whole to strongly support the whole package of amendments. The report was adopted by 27 votes in favour and one abstention in June. Under this clause, it will be possible to apply safeguard measures if the reductions to the customs duties on products imported from South Korea threaten to cause serious damage to European industry. As you know, under the new powers given to Parliament following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the adoption of this regulation is following the ordinary legislative procedure. Unfortunately, it was not possible to hold a trialogue with a mandate from the Council before the summer recess. The first official trialogue was held on 30 August, and both the shadow rapporteurs and I were able to hear the Council’s reaction to our amendments. That meeting enabled us to move forward on many points and define the final text of some paragraphs, and our feeling following the meeting is that we believe the Council genuinely wants to reach an agreement on the most controversial points and is working hard to do so. This is, of course, something that we view very positively. However, at the same time, we do not think there has been time to sufficiently clarify the Council’s position on the points on which it has a different view to that adopted in the Committee on International Trade. All the political groups therefore unanimously decided that the time had come for Parliament to take a position in plenary on the amendments adopted in the Committee on International Trade in July, which are vital in order for the safeguard clause to be applicable and effective. At the same time, a unanimous decision was taken not to close the door on a possible agreement at first reading, which we firmly believe will be possible when the Council clarifies its position. We will therefore vote tomorrow only on the amendments tabled by the Committee on International Trade and, in accordance with Rule 55, we will defer the vote on the legislative report to the second part-session in October, when we hope to reach a positive conclusion to the legislative procedure. We believe that the report incorporates a whole series of improvements such as creating an on-line platform to speed up the processes; the possibility of the industry being able to initiate an investigation process; the Commission being obliged to produce reports; and improvements in the monitoring and surveillance of Korean imports. These are points on which we have already reached an agreement in principle with the Council. I think this is a good result, but we still do not think it is enough. There are other, even more fundamental points that deserve the full attention of the negotiators and which all the political groups must defend here, as we did in the Committee on International Trade. I am essentially talking about four points. Firstly, we need to mitigate the possible risk to the more vulnerable Member States by establishing a regional clause, region by region, to prevent some sensitive industries from being affected. We should not forget that the safeguard clause is essentially temporary and its objective is precisely to safeguard the most sensitive sectors of the economy so that they have sufficient time to adapt to the new situation. Secondly, we need to clearly establish surveillance for the products affected by the duty drawback clause. Thirdly, we need to defend Parliament’s role in the process of initiating investigations, and the final point is the decision-making process or comitology. As well as mentioning the good will shown by the Belgian Presidency during the negotiations, finally, I want to mention the vital role that the Commission is playing and will continue to play in bringing the negotiations to a sound conclusion.

Madam President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their kind words. Commissioner De Gucht, as we have heard here today, the European Parliament is making its position very clear. As one fellow Member said, this is an historic moment that will set a precedent and this is an historic report that will set a precedent for future agreements. Parliament wants to reach an agreement at first reading and will do everything it can to achieve that. As one of my fellow Members said, this is a key moment for European industry, which needs the new incentives and new markets that this agreement is bound to bring. This is also, however, a delicate time for employment, and we need to guarantee employment in Europe. We also need to guarantee that this agreement does not damage European industry, and in order to do so, we need a strong safeguard clause such as the one adopted by the Committee on International Trade, which will probably be endorsed and strengthened by Parliament’s votes tomorrow. It is therefore now time for the Council and also the Commission to act. The Commission must continue to support us, and we appeal to both institutions to take responsibility. I want to stress that we will seek to reach an agreement at first reading, but we need to get moving. I believe that it is possible, and we await the proposals. Pable Zalba Bidegain,

Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that we must see Latin America as a hugely important trade partner. We believe that negotiations should be reopened for the agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which affects 700 million people and will be the most ambitious bi-regional agreement in the world. We also believe that negotiations concerning the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit, which is to be held in May. We also need to develop the association agreements with Mexico and Chile, which have been a real success. We must therefore express our satisfaction at the conclusion of the free trade agreement with Colombia, which is going to be very beneficial both to Europe and to the Latin American country. We believe that Parliament’s job now is to ratify these agreements in due time and to ensure that no country in the Andean Community that wishes to conclude an agreement is excluded. We, of course, also believe that free trade agreements can and should also be a useful tool for promoting the development of citizens’ rights and freedoms. Lastly, we believe that the path to follow in the future is, on the one hand, to develop the European Union’s agreements with the various countries and regional groups and, on the other, to promote inter-regional integration agreements within Latin America itself.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is very clear as far as the European Union’s trade policy is concerned. We are firm defenders of free trade and it is certainly vital that Europe continues negotiating trade agreements with other countries because they generate new opportunities for European companies, that is to say, new jobs, which are very much required in light of the serious current economic crisis. I did very much like your words Commissioner, because I also believe that it is very important that these agreements contain sufficient guarantees to avoid signing clauses which are unbalanced and unfair for European industry. The agreement with South Korea has been put forward by the Commission as the first in a new generation of more ambitious trade agreements for Europe, hence the importance of this agreement. It is not a question of whether it is a small country or not; it is a question of not weakening our capacity for negotiation in future agreements with much larger countries. Therefore, we are not against the South Korea free trade agreement; however, we do want certain paragraphs to be studied more rigorously, which we believe create unfair competitive disadvantages for certain European industrial sectors and give Korean producers an unfair advantage. Commissioner, I want you to clearly explain to me why the safeguard clause for the duty drawback enters into force in five years. On the last opportunity I had to speak to you, you stated that the reason was that tariffs on vehicles were also dismantled after five years. The agreement stipulates that they will dismantle the tariffs for vehicles which weigh more than five tonnes after five years. However, for vehicles which weigh less than five tonnes, which are all standard vehicles, the 10% tariff will be dismantled in three years. What is the reason for this two-year time lapse Commissioner? I would also like to receive more details regarding any updates on this aspect you mentioned. What is the point of correcting these problems ex post 
when the whole reason for having a safeguard clause is to anticipate possible negative consequences? Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

Mr President, the agreement reached by Parliament and the Council reflects what was unanimously approved by the Member States concerned in the International Maritime Organisation. These seas have disconcerting levels of acidification. Moreover, their capacity for regeneration is very limited. The fuels required are going to be more expensive, and therefore there are plans for financial aid for businesses, which is very reasonable. Some Members, however, have sought to have the requirements for new fuels applied to all the Union’s seas. We would find ourselves with a paradox in that we would be trying to solve an environmental problem of some Member States by creating a major economic problem in the Mediterranean, which does not have that environmental problem, but does have other environmental problems, the costs of which we are not seeking to impose on the other Member States. The Treaty is very clear. Sensitive areas must be protected. However, not all areas are equally sensitive. Pilar Ayuso,

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Ms Auconie for her hard work and efforts to reach a consensus. With regard to the two issues at hand, I must say that I entirely agree with the Commission’s proposal on the electronic identification of beef. However, I cannot say the same for the voluntary beef labelling system. The Commission’s proposal to delete this provision is neither appropriate nor correct. Specifically, this labelling system has played a very important role in restoring European consumers’ confidence in beef and products derived from beef. In my view, the argument being put forward by the Commission regarding a heavy administrative burden is not valid at present, as the operational mechanism is perfectly familiar to the authorities and the sector. Proof that the mechanism is working very well can be found in the fact that in my country, for example, 180 requests for beef labelling have been approved, as opposed to just 32 for goat meat and 55 for poultry and eggs. Voluntary labelling is a highly effective tool for making a distinction between varieties of a product, and consumers want to be informed about what they are buying and consuming. However, consumers do not distinguish between voluntary and mandatory labelling, and they often consider voluntary labelling to be more important and more relevant than mandatory labelling. All of this information combined is what enables them to make informed choices. Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 is by no means perfect, but it is nevertheless much better than the legal vacuum that could be created if Articles 16, 17 and 18 are deleted, because we would be faced with a new system with no prior warning and no mandatory external control. One possible solution to improve the system would be to establish specific sectoral standards for beef, as already exist for other products, such as those in the chicken and poultry sector. I believe the Commission is in the process of doing so. Lastly, I would like to point out that labelling plays a vital role in consumer decision making, and this is precisely what we have defended in Parliament. It is therefore very hard to understand why we should now want to abolish it. Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to draw attention to the excellent work done by Ms McAvan, the rapporteur, and also the other shadow rapporteurs, in order to reach this agreement at first reading. This was very important because the regulation we adopted in 2010 was coming into force and it needed to be amended. It was not amended because it was a flawed piece of legislation – quite the contrary. Rather, it was amended because, as has been said, recent events took place, of which we are all aware, showing that there was a loophole that needed to be closed in order for it not to occur again. It was also necessary to strengthen certain specific points concerning pharmacovigilance and the safety of medicines once placed on the market. As we have already heard, from now on, marketing authorisation holders who do not renew a marketing authorisation or who withdraw or request the withdrawal or suspension of an authorisation will be obliged to inform the competent authorities of the real reasons and motives for withdrawing or suspending it. This is a major success for transparency and it will prevent the market authorisation holder from trying to conceal the real reasons behind its decision. Moreover, in the event that any of these actions is carried out in a third country, all the Member States in which that medicine is marketed must be informed. All this will improve transparency and safety, without the European Medicines Agency and national agencies being overly burdened as a result. The second important amendment we have achieved is that all authorised products that are subject to some kind of post-authorisation safety study (PASS) will be systematically included on the list of products subject to such monitoring. Lastly, we cannot forget that pharmacovigilance plays a fundamental role, and Parliament should therefore adopt this proposal. Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Perello on the enormous amount of work he has done, on his readiness to collaborate with all the shadow rapporteurs, and also to congratulate the shadow rapporteurs on the way they have all worked with each other. I also praise the Polish Presidency and the Commission for their efforts to reach an agreement on first reading. Parliament, the Council and the Commission have had divergent positions, sometimes very different, on several issues, and this made the agreement far from easy and not fully satisfactory to everyone, but we can say that it is reasonably satisfactory. The point that must be highlighted in the amendment of this directive, as already stated, is that, from now on, sugar may not be added to either pressed or concentrated juices. However, fruit nectars will be products sweetened with sugar, honey or sweeteners. It is clear that the average consumer is unaware of this legislation and, therefore, of the difference between juices and nectars. For this reason, I feel that the agreement between the three institutions to put a statement on packaging for a limited period to say that fruit juices do not contain sugar will not only help consumers to tell the difference between two products, but also make them much better informed. The objective of this initiative was to amend Directive 2001/112/EC for the second time, bringing it into line with technical progress and the developments in international regulations relating to the Codex Alimentarius. However, despite the support of all the farming organisations in the Union, as already mentioned, the Council and the Commission, surprisingly, have rejected the possibility of mandarin juice being added to orange juice in amounts less than 10% and mandarin appearing on the list of ingredients, as permitted by the Codex Alimentarius (STAN 45-1981), given that this is common practice in Brazil and the United States, from which we import a large amount of concentrates. In this regard, another area of conflict during the negotiations was the restoration of flavour, pulp and cells lost during the juice and nectar extraction process. All sides agreed, during the negotiations, to maintain the Commission’s original proposal on restoring flavours, pulp and cells from the same fruit species. However, some members of my political group are going to vote against this report for precisely this reason. Lastly, I would like to mention two things that worry me. Firstly, imported products marketed within the European Union are not generally required to meet the same quality and food safety standards as our own products, and in a case such as this one, in which such standards are required by the legislation, they are not sufficiently controlled. The second thing, which also concerns me, is the way the Commission uses delegated acts to substantially amend legislation, as it has recently attempted to do with the regulation on nutrition and health claims with regard to the ‘no added sugar’ claim. This is similar to what it is trying to do at the moment, although it is not the same case, with the Timber Regulation. This is the reason for Parliament’s position on delegated acts. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner. Mrs Sommer, the shadow rapporteurs, the Hungarian Presidency and the Commission have come to a good agreement with regard to this Regulation which is so important for consumers and the food industry. Many congratulations to all of them. As consumers, of course, we want comprehensive information about everything we eat. However, to put this information on the packaging is no mean feat and we must find a balance in everything. We must also find a cost-benefit balance as we cannot overlook the fact that the information on the labelling, depending on the nature of that information, makes the product more expensive. Someone has to pay that cost. If the consumer does not pay it then many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will have to quit the market as they cannot compete with large companies that can pay this additional cost. I believe that this balance has been achieved and we have to be satisfied. We have to be satisfied with regard to country of origin labelling, for example. It was already foreseen that, where confusion may arise, the origin of products should be labelled. Furthermore, it is permitted that this labelling may be done voluntarily. With regard to processed products containing several ingredients, it is not easy to determine what the main ingredient is. Therefore, another solution other than that adopted would raise implementation problems because of the economic cost and administrative complexity for the companies, without bringing the consumer any clear additional benefit. Also in this context, I agree that this legislation should not be applied to alcohol products as all these products already have comprehensive legislation concerning labelling, and everyone knows that when you drink an alcohol product you are consuming alcohol and that it has calories. In short, all of this is important but, above all, it is very important to educate consumers so that they are able to absorb all this information. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

Mr President, first of all, I wish to express my condolences to the relatives of those who have died as the result of this crisis. Commissioner, informing the public of health risks is a difficult and delicate task and has to be perfectly documented and verified. It is not a question of finding who is to blame, but on this occasion, major errors have occurred, starting with the foolhardy and reckless assumptions of a regional policy manager, recently recruited to the job, who unleashed social alarm and a very serious, irreparable economic crisis. Nor would it appear that the Commission has coordinated this crisis very well. I wonder when the first case occurred, and whether Article 3 of the regulation relating to the rapid alert system – which requires Member States to notify the risk immediately and within 48 hours – was met, and also whether Article 8 of said regulation – which obliges the Commission to check whether the information is complete, true and legible and has sufficient legal basis – was met. What is certain is that the serious shortcomings of this regulation have been exposed and that it is necessary to review the current legal framework in order to define precisely, among other things, the crisis management procedures used by the competent authorities, to attribute errors or omissions to the perpetrator in the food chain (and traceability is used to this end), to prevent health protection from concealing commercial barriers and to arbitrate compensation procedures for damage to trade and loss of profit. Commissioner, neither cucumbers or soya are the cause. As Mr Liese has said, the cause is the pathogen. The cause is serotype O104:H4 of the bacterium Escherichia coli
, which is already described throughout scientific literature and is associated with meat products. However, in any case, Commissioner, we have to allow the scientists to do their work: they need to investigate the entire traceability system, throughout the food chain, including the handling and distribution of food. Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Liotard, the Hungarian Presidency and Commissioner Dalli and his team for their efforts. Unfortunately, however, this regulation, which is so important and so necessary, has not reached a satisfactory conclusion because of a labelling requirement that went beyond what was possible in practice. This is a subject that inspires passion and attracts media attention, factors that run counter to logic and pragmatism. I have to say that we have missed the chance to take a step forward, have condemned the agri-food industry to living with obsolete legislation and have put the brakes on European technological advancement, of which we are so supportive in theory. We cannot demand something that involves a level of cost and bureaucracy that cannot be assumed by the food-producing sector, nor can we demand something that we are not capable of imposing upon third parties. We cannot legislate on something that later we will not be able to implement because we would be deceiving consumers. I repeat, it is a pity that we have not reached agreement because this regulation dealt not only with cloning and with how many generations and which products must be labelled, but also with many other points on which agreement has
 been reached, such as nanotechnology and foodstuffs coming from third countries, which were very important for consumers and for the agri-food industry, not only from the point of view of the internal market, but also from a health perspective and in terms of innovation. Since cloning is too complex a matter to relegate to a few paragraphs in another proposal, I urge the Commission once again to prepare a report and present a separate legislative proposal that regulates every aspect of cloning, based on food security and all scientific data. Given that Commissioner Dalli has committed himself on numerous occasions before this House to presenting this proposal, I trust that the Commission will send it to us as soon as possible. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, who has worked very hard and, most importantly, achieved an optimum result. It was not at all easy to reach an agreement at first reading on a regulation as complex as this one. The motor industry is of vital importance in the European Union. It is, moreover, an industry that is committed to the European Union’s objective of reducing emissions and to technological innovation. This agreement is a stable framework that gives legal certainty to our vehicle manufacturers. I believe that the targets for reducing emissions are both ambitious and realistic. Manufacturers will have to achieve 147 grams of CO2
 per kilometre by 2020. I am sure that they are going to succeed, and they will therefore have contributed to the European Union’s objective of reducing emissions by 20% by that year. However, there are also other elements of interest in this new regulation, such as super-credits and promoting alternative fuels. Biofuels are clearly promoted, in line with the EU’s objectives regarding renewable fuels for 2020. I am highlighting this obvious fact because if the Commission continues with its hesitant proposals on biofuels, we will not achieve our objective for 2020. Finally, I would like to end my speech by congratulating the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), who has just become a mother and has worked very hard and also helped to make this agreement a success. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

 Madam President, our goals must be ambitious, but it must also be acknowledged that the rapporteur’s proposal is not easy to apply with the situation that exists in each Member State. However, we in the Spanish delegation will support his proposal at first reading. Nevertheless, we are in favour the cost of recycling and treatment being invoiced separately. We are going to vote against Amendment 52, which aims to delete Article 14(1), and in favour of Amendments 91 and 103. We believe that consumers have a right to know what this treatment costs and, moreover, that they should know: that motivates them to collaborate with the legislation itself and it is also positive in order for there to be a suitable amount of transparency in the commercial chain. Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to highlight the work that has been done by the rapporteur, Mrs McAvan, not only on the content of the report, but also in terms of her methods, because she has worked alongside all the shadow rapporteurs. I would also like to thank the experts from the Spanish Government for their contribution to this agreement. The purpose of this system of pharmacovigilance in the European Union is to strengthen vigilance, transparency and communication in relation to the safety of drugs once they have been put on the market, especially with regard to their risk profiles and the adverse reactions that they can cause. It is important to highlight the creation of the European Pharmacovigilance Committee, which will evaluate and issue recommendations to the European Medicines Agency on the safety issues that can arise in connection with medicines sold in the European Union. The solution that has been reached for both Member States and those responsible for marketing medicines to notify the EudraVigilance database of suspected adverse reactions is very important. EudraVigilance will be the only source of information, but the competent authority in the Member State where it is suspected that an adverse reaction has occurred will be informed at the same time, which is very important. It is also important to highlight the possibility that is being opened up of consumers being able to communicate any adverse reactions, and in this respect, the creation and management by the agency of a European medicines safety web-portal which, in turn, is linked to the portals in each of the Member States, is going to help to improve the public’s knowledge regarding the safety of the medicines that they take. Finally, we cannot forget that given that pharmacovigilance plays a fundamental role in protecting public health, the adoption of this directive and this regulation is going to make a significant contribution to that protection by improving not only the current procedures but also the coordination of actions between the different Member States. Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his explanation about the cloning of animals for use as food. Both Parliament and Commission agree that the Novel Food Regulation was indeed not the appropriate framework to deal with this issue. We agree on this, which explains why the issue has been withdrawn from the scope of application of the regulation. We are also all aware, at least according to all the scientific committees, that cloned animal meat, and that of its offspring, satisfy all food safety requirements. It is only here that I see a problem. Namely, that it is impossible to distinguish whether or not meat comes from a cloned animal, or the offspring of a cloned animal, or from an animal that has not been cloned. Therefore, there is a need – an essential need – to use labelling and traceability in order for the consumer to be informed. Consumers want, and have the right, to know if the meat they are eating comes from a cloned animal or not, regardless of knowing whether or not it is healthy, because they may refuse to eat it owing to the issues you have explained, such as animal welfare, or for ethical reasons. It seems, therefore, given this situation, that the production and consumption of cloned animals in Europe is probably going to be banned, particularly its production. Thus, we are going to ban our producers from using a new technique, one that is good for animal reproduction and which, moreover, can make a profit, because obviously, an animal is cloned as a result of having very special characteristics, something which has been done in Spain with fighting bulls, where, as you know, two fighting bulls have been cloned. And we are going to ban it! Are we going to deny them the possibility of using this technique? Because, if that is the case, then our farmers, our livestock breeders, are going to lose competitiveness. This would be fine if, in Europe, we could ban the entry of meat from cloned animals, and their offspring, from other countries. However, are we going ban it? We cannot do so. The World Trade Organisation is not going to accept our ban. Therefore, we are going to have an absurd situation whereby our livestock breeders are not going to be able to use a new technique that will enable them to become more competitive, yet, we are going to be eating such food in the European Union, with or without a label. This is what worries me, and I feel a solution needs to be found. Why are we going to ban it? Why are we going to prevent our livestock breeders from using this technique, only to later bring this food in from outside because we cannot ban its importation? Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, as you have said, this regulation is very important, not only for consumers, but also for the food industry. It deals with novel foods and new processes for manufacturing foodstuffs. As has been said here, the most controversial issue has been that of meat originating from cloned animals and their offspring, as what generally enters the food chain is the offspring, not the cloned animal. I believe that it was a sensible move on the part of Parliament to remove the issue of meat from cloned animals from this proposal, as it is not really possible to dedicate just a few paragraphs to such a novel and new technique as the cloning of animals, even though it is normal in some countries. There is an amendment relating to this within which the Commission, as you have promised, is asked to present a report and a legislative proposal. We are having a bit of a debate here, including within my own group, as to whether we should ask the Commission to present a proposal banning meat from cloned animals, or simply ask the Commission to present a proposal. My opinion is that the Commission should present the proposal, and we should not tell it how to present it. The Commission should present the proposal, and then we will debate it in Parliament, say whether we like it or do not like it, and amend it. This is my position, although we are divided within my group, and tomorrow we will vote on a divided basis. There is another issue, which interests me a great deal, and which you have mentioned, which is the issue of nanomaterials. I agree that a new definition is needed, but we should not limit ourselves to definition and labelling. Any authorisation of nanomaterials must be preceded by exhaustive scientific tests, as these are new materials that are to be incorporated into food, and the question of food safety needs to be a priority. I hope and trust that this will be the case. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE
) 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this regulation is of crucial importance for consumers and the agri-food industry, because it is not at all easy to achieve balanced labelling that includes all the essential information but not so much as to complicate it. This is an excellent report and the rapporteur must be congratulated on it. I agree with her on the main subjects regarding nutritional information and the controversial issue of profiles, especially if we bear in mind that the Commission failed to meet its commitment to establish these profiles – as well as the conditions for their use – before 19 January, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. An issue that concerns me is the possibility that national labelling standards will be in existence at the same time: this runs counter to the purpose of the legislation, which is harmonisation and the removal of as many obstacles as possible to the working of a true single market. As regards the indication of country of origin, under the current legislation, this information must be given when failure to do so could mislead the consumer. There is also provision for there always being voluntary labelling. Going further may involve a financial cost and administrative cost for companies, without bringing the consumer any significant and clear benefit. On the use of different languages, I have to say that the Commission’s proposal matches up with the existing directive, which has worked well and not caused problems. Reopening this debate could be dangerous and unnecessary, and could cause problems with the movement of products. Pilar Ayuso,

 Mr President, thrombin is an additive that can be used to stick meat because the fact is that there are no technological or food safety problems related to its use. Indeed, it is already used in some countries. The proposed amendment to the annex states that meat processed with thrombin can be sold pre-packed and labelled; thus, the consumer will not be deceived, which is the basic principle of the resolution. Whatever the case, I would like to ask the Commissioner if the European Commission can commit to products that contain thrombin not being able to be considered as imitations as a result of a suitable label, especially within the framework of the present study of the proposed Regulation on the food information provided to the consumer.

Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Jiménez García-Herrera, I would first of all like to highlight the work done by the rapporteurs – Mr Mikolášik and Mr Perello – and all the work that they have done to reach the best possible compromise for a transplant policy in the European Union. I would also like to highlight the contribution made by the Spanish Presidency and by Dr Matesanz, the Director of the Spanish National Transplant Organisation, because Spain is currently the world leader in terms of donations, with 34.4 for every million inhabitants. This is solely due to the constant improvement in organisation and to the measures that have been taken to raise awareness among the population about organ donation. We need to achieve this for the whole of the European Union: increase the number of donations, ensure that all transplants are done to the same quality standards, and also promote cooperation between all the Member States. We also need to ensure that every donation is voluntary and not rewarded, with the exceptions listed by Commissioner Dalli, in order to combat organ trafficking, which is entirely linked to a scarcity of organs. The action plan can contribute to this by helping to solve the shortage of organs and improving public access to transplants. The solution that has been reached for living donors is very important, as we cannot forget that living donations are complementary and have been shown to be effective even if there is no genetic relationship between the donor and the recipient. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, I want to begin by congratulating the Commissioner, because she works tirelessly in this area – I can vouch for that – especially given that this topic that we are discussing is really very complicated. I would also add the following. There is one area, Commissioner, in which we have demonstrated that we definitely can reduce emissions –indeed, we are seeing its positive impact on growth, competitiveness and, therefore, job creation – and in which Europe is a leader in the technological sphere and is carrying out many actions with specific objectives: that area is energy efficiency. I have said it before and I will say it again now. I believe that Doha, like the last COP in Durban, is a great opportunity for Europe, and the European Union, to head up the development of a road map for energy efficiency, with different types of goals, with common actions, with deadlines, etc. This really needs a precise structure and framework, and the European Union, more than anyone, has an undeniable opportunity to pioneer a road map for energy efficiency.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, what we are debating today are two reports: one by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and another by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The aim of these reports is, among other things, to convey to the Commission Parliament’s views on shale gas so that at a later date, as the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Potočnik, has said, the Commission can present a report on a series of measures relating to this energy source to enable harmonised action within the European Union. I believe that both rapporteurs have put forward the points of view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in a very reasonable manner. Logically their perspectives are not exactly the same. In the case of the two Commissioners, they have set out their vision with a great deal of balance and in a measured way, which is essential for any debate such as this to take place. Someone said before I took the floor that one cannot debate using emotions and when emotions are running high. I ask you who can name or talk about a single energy source that does not carry risks and opportunities for developing the benefits that it brings. The same applies to this one. If humanity had rejected every advance, every encounter, every discovery of the possibility of developing an energy source solely due to the risks that it carried, we would have made no progress at all. We have to insist much more that the technology is as good as possible, that there is investment into research and that this new source of energy can be developed, with all the guarantees in place, in a measured way and without emotion. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, Commissioner, please allow me to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Kariņš, and all the shadow rapporteurs, who took the decision to continue moving forward during the negotiation in the trialogues, which was fraught with difficulties, and described so well by Mr Kariņš. I would say that thanks to that effort and determination, we now have a mechanism that, for the first time, allows information and communication to be exchanged between Member States and the Commission regarding intergovernmental agreements in the field of energy that are reached in those Member States. I believe the idea is to have constant knowledge of the supply map or the energy supply networks and it is very positive, therefore, for the improved management of energy supply in the European Union. When it comes to this regulation, if I had to use a simile, I would say we are paving the way to progressing more quickly in developing the internal energy market. If we throw this opportunity away and do not start paving the way, as is the desire of a certain political group in the House, we would simply be missing a golden opportunity. After a time, we would find ourselves in the same situation as today, but much further down the line. I trust, therefore, there will be a lot of parliamentary support for this proposal tomorrow. I thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs once again for their contribution. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, this is undoubtedly one of the most important legislative contributions in the field of energy in this parliamentary term. Ultimately, there will be few other things that will have the same significance as this Energy Efficiency Directive, and this is as a result of tenacity and hard work. It is as a result of the work done by the rapporteur, but also by shadow rapporteurs who have done truly admirable work, and I therefore congratulate them all. This directive basically has three objectives: it will help to make the European Union less of an energy island, it will help to make climate change targets a reality, and it will also help to develop an energy efficiency market that will make it possible to have greater economic growth through the right technologies. I would, however, like to highlight one thing which I think is the major contribution that Parliament is making to this directive, which is flexibility: flexibility in the 1.5% savings target for energy distributors and sellers, or the target of renovating 3% of buildings; and the flexibility that Member States have to apply alternative measures. This is the key, because there is a great deal of diversity within the European Union. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

 Mr President, allow me to also begin by personally congratulating Ms Niebler for having led so professionally and so successfully, on Parliament’s behalf, the third regulation on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union, now known as ‘Roaming III’. Not only has it been a success – as far as I can see – by substantially lowering the upper limits of what operators can charge consumers for mobile services when they are in another EU Member State, but the proposal for a regulation that we will vote on in this plenary session also includes other measures such as, for example, extending transparency clauses to European consumers travelling to non-Member States. However, above all, the greatest merit of the Roaming III Regulation is – in my view – its desire to become obsolete and create a competitive market for roaming services themselves, where it will no longer be necessary to regulate the situation in each of the different 27 markets every two years, but rather the situation in the single market, which should represent the European Union. This regulation, which we will vote on tomorrow, will not only be limited on this occasion to establishing new maximum tariffs that mobile phone operators must respect when European consumers travel outside the European Union, but, for the first time, we are tackling the situation – in my view, in a much more intelligent way – by establishing a competitive market. If the structural measures proposed in the regulation are successful, we European consumers will have the option of taking out a roaming contract with a different operator to the one providing us with mobile services in our own country, and we will be able to do this simply and keep our phone number. It is an essential contribution to the development of the digital single market. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, I am just going to go over two points very quickly. The first is possibly the most discussed issue in this report and that which has led to the most disagreement: whether or not to deal with the emissions trading mechanism. It is clear that it is suffering like any other ‘market’, and it is suffering due to the downturn, but I think it would be wrong to intervene in this market. To intervene to try to improve prices, as is done in other sectors, would be a serious error. More growth is needed. What we have to do is give it a boost, so that we can emerge from the crisis and then the emissions market will return to how it was. Secondly, when it comes to the Roadmap, as has been said here, there are a lot of uncertainties. If I had to draw up a map with different roads to take us to the final objective, which would be a low-carbon economy, there is one road, one route that is the main route: that of energy efficiency. In this area, we can indeed say and plan many things. We have reached agreement on the Energy Efficiency Directive, with a huge effort made by all the parliamentary groups. This is the same agreement that my group and I would like to see reflected in today’s vote on the report we are debating. I honestly believe it is worth it. We managed it for energy efficiency, why can we not do the same with this report? Pilar del Castillo Vera,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (ES) 
Madam President, Commissioner, I think that your explanation was a very logical one, full of common sense. The thing is that sometimes such explanations, which are really very sound, compete with reflections that are equally sound. I think that what we do in Parliament at this point serves as a wake-up call to ensure that an instrument that has had a history of success does not disappear because of theoretical solutions which could in principle, theoretically, turn out to be more efficient but which would, in any event, put an end to the development of a tool that has made a very real contribution so that many programmes derive from it and have very important consequences for energy saving. I am not going to mention them all but there is no doubt that actions such as European Local ENergy Assistance (ELENA), Solar Keymark or GreenLight are success stories. All this has always been based upon a fundamental pillar, namely, innovation, even in these especially severe times of crisis in Europe. It is impossible for societies that do not make innovation the driving force of their development to survive in such a competitive, global society and here we have before us a tool that has proved useful precisely for the purpose of developing innovation in the energy sector. Therefore, Commissioner, our modest contribution is to insist that a tool such as this must not be wasted because it has been tried and tested and, accordingly, we have to give extremely careful consideration to the fact that this intelligent energy tool for Europe could disappear.

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we are faced with one of the issues that forms the basis for the success of the Internet, namely the competitive nature and neutral character of the network. In this sense, everything that is related to that aspect is extremely important. I would say that the resolution we are proposing and debating this afternoon is, without a doubt, particularly balanced. It is in accordance with the Commission, in the sense that, when information exists that gives us an indication that a change is occurring to the neutral character of the network, then that would be the moment to propose some kind of legislative action, but that, in the meantime, it is necessary to wait to see what is contained in the report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications. I would like to add something else: there are three conditions sine qua non
, which, in my view, are essential for guaranteeing neutrality on the network. Firstly, there needs to be a truly competitive market for service and telecommunications operators. Secondly, the user needs to be able to change supplier quickly and easily. Otherwise, without a doubt, the market will be very weak from a competitive point of view. Third is transparency. Transparency means, however, that users must be properly informed of all the criteria used by network operators, so that they can really know whether or not they are of interest to them or, on the contrary, whether or not it is of interest to them to switch supplier, as was previously commented.

 Mr President, I would also like to address Mr Barroso, even though he is not here right now, via the Commissioner. I believe that a reasonable work programme has been set, as in previous years. However, what I feel is missing is the sense of urgency, and this worries me. In many countries, of course including Spain, my own Member State, people get up every morning driven by the urgency of the reforms that must be carried out: in the job market, in budgetary stability, public debt, and so on. What we have here is a programme that, to my way of thinking, lacks that sense of urgency. The main thing it lacks is, essentially, the power of the European Union project to help develop growth and employment, which is the internal market, and the digital internal market as a variant of this. We urgently need to address everything that continues to hinder the development of the internal market today – and there is still a lot – in terms of the transposition and development of directives (such as the Services Directive), and many other aspects that prevent us from unifying and integrating the extraordinary legislative fragmentation currently hampering the development of that market. My main message is that you need to regain the sense of urgency, because if you do not, there is not much that the European Union can do. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I believe the climate change conference in Durban has an advantage over its immediate predecessors: there is no doubt whatsoever that achieving a binding international agreement is impossible. This should enable energy to be channelled into proposals and joint lines of action that will indeed allow us to progress in practice towards the goal of emissions cuts. So this is good news, because we were not in this position in Cancún, much less when the Copenhagen climate summit was held. I believe this is the time for the European Union to become the regional leader in energy efficiency proposals, which really can unite the work of a great number of other countries, from the most developed and the richest, to the least developed and the poorest. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fighting against climate change by boosting energy efficiency brings incredible opportunities in all areas, and I sincerely believe that it is time for the European Union to become the leader in combating climate change through energy efficiency.

 Mr President, Commissioner, whenever there has previously been any discussion about SMEs, the focus has been on intervention in financial matters, the lack of liquidity and problems in accessing credit, because that is really the main problem. It is the main problem for governments, SMEs, all companies, banks and, to a large extent, I would say it is the main problem, above all, for each and every member of society. However, allow me to focus on one dimension that I feel is strategically fundamental, and that has only been partially touched upon. It is to do with the internal market. Over recent weeks, the European institutions have been insisting on the importance of taking a decisive step forward in developing the internal market as a strategic element or strategic factor in overcoming the crisis. If we look at the relationship between the internal market and SMEs today, we can see that only 23% of these companies engage in cross-border trade, and that only 13% export outside the European Union, and this gives us a clear idea of how far we still have to go in this area. The problem is that it is very difficult to tackle the current legislative fragmentation on basic issues in the internal market. When SMEs compare the costs and profits, it is really very hard for them to finance the fragmentation in the internal market today, and this is something that must be resolved.

 Mr President, we are discussing a report that the Commission presented when the occasion arose on the strategy for tackling a matter of special importance, namely, the volatility of prices of raw materials and the increase in demand for raw materials on the part of developing countries, especially China. For my group’s part, we wish to express our thanks for the Bütikofer report and to say that to a very large degree we share the views expressed in it because we consider that it develops, brings into focus and adopts a truly satisfactory approach to raw materials and the strategy for their use, access and development. In that sense, we think that the report we are debating adopts a balanced approach to access to raw materials both within and outside the EU, raw materials which are fundamental and critical. We think that adequate emphasis is placed on the importance of using sources of raw materials efficiently, and that a number of very interesting proposals are put forward for improving recycling practices in the EU. In addition, I would like to point out on behalf of my group that in our opinion, bearing in mind that maintaining growth is fundamental, the issue should not be tackled from the point of view of reducing consumption. Economic growth must be maintained and promoted and, accordingly, what we need to consider are policies for efficient use of these raw materials and policies that truly incentivise rational use of the same. Likewise, we believe that the impact on speculation will be positive because, as a result of the transparency measures proposed by the Commission, we will face a more transparent market than the one in which we find ourselves today and, accordingly, one with reduced scope for speculation.

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have to be careful how debates develop. When the Commissioner is constantly being interrupted, there is then an avalanche of questions from other Members of the House, and it is very difficult for the debate to remain on the subject that is being examined and in relation to the points the Commissioner has raised, rather than other Members’ wishes. The first thing I want to say is that some Members of this House need to show a little humility and a little common sense, because they make it appear that they are the only ones that have ever thought about nuclear safety and the only ones who are worried about the future of their children and humanity. The 58 reactors in France or those in the United Kingdom or those in many other countries do not mean that the French or others may be more stupid or less intelligent, or that the future of their children does not worry them, or that they have never thought about nuclear safety. Ladies and gentlemen, nuclear safety is something that is being continually worked on in all nuclear plants in relation to every nuclear reactor. There are many top-quality professionals, not people sitting here spouting hot air, but rather people that have been working on these issues day in day out since the beginning. Is a joint review of stress tests now required? I am completely in agreement, and I have to say that some of the people that are now talking about these issues refused to endorse this Parliament’s joint resolution on this subject, which was supported by the majority of the groups in the House. On that basis, a distinction must be made: we are talking about stress tests and not the abolition of nuclear energy. Those will be national debates and they will have to be carried out there. This is why, speaking of stress tests, because some people do not want to talk about it, they only speak or discuss this in one debate or another with an undertone of eliminating nuclear energy, I have to say that Commissioner Oettinger has done an extraordinary job in a very short time. He has already agreed and carried out, in practice, a series of measures and tests that will show us the extent of the situation we are now in. Therefore, Commissioner, congratulations, we cannot have anything other than appreciation for you in how you have acted. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, today, we find ourselves discussing in this House a joint proposal for a resolution on the revision of the Small Business Act, which the Commission submitted in February. The relationship between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the economy can be defined in many ways, but in a sense, they are the axis around which any economic system revolves, in this case, the European economies. If they are strong, the economy will do well; if they are weak, the economy will do badly. SMEs generate jobs, growth and, accordingly, prosperity for society. I shall refer to three factors that seem to me to be fundamental to achieving a strong network of enterprises. First, the adoption of information and communication technology and the development of technologies such as online administration or cloud computing, which save money, reduce costs and effort and, therefore, improve the competitiveness of SMEs. Second, innovation, which is equally fundamental in this sector. Accordingly, up-and-coming enterprises in the small and medium-sized business sector must be strongly incentivised. Third, SMEs must be able to participate fully in the internal market, both in terms of cross-border public tendering and as regards all other features of the internal market, which are capable of providing extraordinary benefits to SMEs in terms of their competitiveness but are currently failing to do so. Finally, after all this comes the value of entrepreneurship, a social value which must be strong since, if it is not, the whole network will be weak. In this area, both governments and the European Union have much to do, principally through education. Pilar del Castillo Vera,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, our colleague, Mr Hökmark, because his work is excellent and, in addition to being excellent, it has great vision for the future, which I think makes it particularly valuable. However, please also allow me to thank, as he did, all the shadow rapporteurs. The result of all this work was the unanimous backing that this report received in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Of course, the report before us is guided by an objective, which is none other than a way of making the European economy more competitive in a global world. That is the key objective of this report and I therefore believe that it is extraordinarily appropriate. I am not going to go into the details, but I would like to focus on two or three aspects that I consider key. First of all, we are in a situation – and this report points this out – in which wireless broadband through the 800 MHz allocation for mobile communications across Europe will be a reality. However the report goes much further: it is thinking more about the future. We are talking about the 700 MHz frequency band, which also has an extraordinary capacity for mobile telephony and its development. I believe that is why we also have to view and evaluate the proposals made in the report very positively. It is not a trivial issue: the spectrum relating to economic activities currently represents 3% of European gross domestic product (GDP) and that is just the start. I should like to mention the importance of video’s exponential growth as an element of communication between different people, and between different institutions and companies. Right now, video represents 40% of world traffic and that is only the start: by 2014, it will represent 91% of end-user traffic. As such, the report positions itself realistically in a vision of an extraordinary future, so I believe that we should give it our full support the day after tomorrow. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need energy to eat, travel, study, cure diseases, and for many other things. That energy has always come from a variety of sources. In some cases, from the oldest sources, such as hydropower, fossil energy, and even nuclear energy; in other cases, from the most modern, for example, renewables. In addition to this, technologies are being developed to bring about increased safety, in some cases, or to offer greater efficiency, as in the case of renewable energies. There is also research that has not yet been applied, such as carbon storage, or that which is expected to – and will – lead us to fusion power. All of this is necessary, ladies and gentlemen, because human life has operated and developed on the basis of constant improvements to the resources used and the research that made this possible. Communication, energy, medicine and study are based on that: the continual improvement of all our resources. Recently, the tsunami and the earthquake that caused it resulted in serious damage for the people of Japan, including victims, missing people and material losses, as well as significant damage to the Fukushima plant. With all that in mind, what we have to do is improve safety. Tomorrow, this House will vote on a joint resolution, on which the vast majority of the parliamentary groups have agreed. It expresses what unites us, not what divides us. I would ask the groups to remain loyal to the content of the proposal and not to allow their own interests to get in the way of the common interest or of the shared view that we have achieved on this proposal. That is our responsibility for tomorrow. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would also like to start by thanking Mr Lange for his efforts in bringing together so many differing opinions and visions, a situation that is quite common in Parliament. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various political groups. In fact, this report tries to answer a question that has already been under consideration for a long time: do European industries have any future in a global world? I think the answer is yes. Yes, because European Union countries are proving that they do. Yes, because there are also specific European industrial sectors that are proving that they do. All of this has to do with a number of aspects: some are related to the job market, because we need a flexible job market, not a rigid one; others are related to productivity, financial policies and tax incentives. However, allow me to highlight three that are now closely linked to the European Union itself. Firstly, the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. These are two key issues. Enterprise and innovation are key elements of the future of any industry in Europe. Particular attention should be paid to young entrepreneurs. Secondly, strengthening the internal market and making sure it is competitive and, internally, based on free competition. Therefore, the subsidies still being given to transport, energy, and publicly owned businesses should be reduced so as to ensure free competition within the European internal market. Thirdly, respecting the conditions of competition within the international framework: when it comes to environmental policies and product sourcing, it is vital to compete on equal terms. We do not want protectionism within the European Union, nor do we want protectionism when our industry competes with third countries and third regions. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission and the parliamentary delegation, led by our fellow Member Mr Leinen, on the work that they did in Cancún, a meeting that I was unfortunately unable to attend in the end. I believe that Cancún and its results can be viewed, along the lines of what my colleague, Mr Seeber, was saying, from the perspective of Copenhagen: Cancún viewed from the Copenhagen perspective. The first conclusion from this perspective is that there was a fundamental differentiating factor. In Copenhagen, the expectations were very high, and in Cancún the expectations were much more realistic, as a result of which the assessment of Copenhagen was very negative, while the assessment of Cancún, both by those who took part and by the media in general, was very positive. Cancún learned lessons from Copenhagen, and I think that is the first, very interesting, conclusion. I believe that measures have been taken and agreements reached which are not, of course, ground-breaking, but which could be very interesting from the point of view of efficiency. Among other things, I think that the creation of a committee and a technology network to promote technological cooperation is extremely important. Here, we are going to adopt a report during this sitting on energy efficiency, which is one of the fundamental keys to effectively combating climate change. Also, I think that matters such as the World Bank being more involved or official recognition of the actions of countries to reduce emissions returning to the procedure and framework of the United Nations are very positive. Finally, I would like to say that there is one year to go before we get to South Africa. It would be a very good idea if, in the same way that Cancún learnt from Copenhagen, we now learnt from Kyoto, and achieved an international frame of reference for an agreement against climate change that is more flexible, more transparent, more efficient and more integrative.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job. Her report is, of course, as ambitious as it is extensive, and I must say that it is the result of the tough and successful negotiations that resulted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopting it practically unanimously. Continuing with this subject, I would like to point out something of which we are all aware, but which there is no harm in saying: the energy situation in Europe is not exactly an optimum one. Not only are we increasingly dependent on energy imports obtained from outside Europe, but we are also having to deal with the huge investments needed in our energy infrastructures at a time when Europe is still suffering the consequences of the crisis. This is all in the context of not yet having managed to apply our own energy legislation. Now in this parliamentary term we have an instrument that was not available in the previous one. The Treaty of Lisbon not only provides a series of clear objectives such as the internal energy market, security of supply, energy efficiency and promoting energy networks, but it also gives the European Union a legal framework and a sound legal basis – Article 194 – for acting in the field of energy policy. In this new context in which we are having this debate, I ask all my fellow Members to support this report, which proposes a series of measures aimed at guaranteeing energy supply and full implementation of the existing legislation and programmes. It also stresses the need to invest in research, promotes the development of pan-European energy grids and gives the creation of the internal energy market the priority it deserves. Thank you very much, and I ask you all to support this report tomorrow. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 – (ES) 
Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, I would like to start by saying that I felt that both speeches by the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner gave a very different perspective on the Cancún conference to their perspective on the Copenhagen conference. It is a more realistic, much more viable perspective, and there is therefore much more potential for it to be effective. If Copenhagen was the all-or-nothing summit – as the President-in-Office of the Council said – Cancún must be the summit that provides a variety of viable and efficient options. The battle against climate change has two fundamental features: firstly it has to be global, involving all the major polluters, from the United States to Brazil, China and India. Secondly, it has to be a series of measures that are effective in their impact on climate change, we need to be able to measure that impact, and they must not be detrimental to economic growth. In this respect we also need to have the humility to recognise that the global challenge of tackling climate change offers a variety of technological and political options. There are and may be binding agreements, there are sectoral agreements, there is technology transfer and there is support for research. All the options need to be brought into play, along with a radical increase in energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy and of society. This is the only way that we will be able to effectively tackle the problems of climate change. In this respect, if Cancún is the summit that produces a variety of viable and efficient agreements, it will have been a great success. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, in this time of crisis, in which we find ourselves, there are two main types of policies and actions: preventive policies and actions and stimulative policies and actions. Preventive policies are those that currently concern the supervision of financial services, governance and strengthening governance. In other words, anything that is going to alert us to the fact that there are problems before the problems overwhelm the European economies. However, the second type of policies – stimulative policies – are essential. There are three fundamental aspects of these policies, Mr Barroso, Mr Wathelet. Naturally, there are more, but I am going to highlight three: research and innovation, the development of a digital society – in other words, the digital agenda – and the internal market. The first, research and innovation, is where I find the work programme presented by the Commission to be lacking. President Barroso said earlier that the specific programmes will come in mid-2011, but I do not think that is enough. I can assure you that I and my group would very much have liked to see a reference to the Eighth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, which does not feature in your proposal. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioners, Mr Magnette, there can be no doubt that the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico has raised awareness of these types of situations, while exposing the need to analyse them in depth and to take measures to prevent or counteract them. These things also occur in Europe. They have occurred. I am a national of a country, Spain, where not many years ago, we had a problem – in the north of the country – with spillages of this type due to problems with transportation, in this case, a problem with tankers. When we find ourselves faced with a situation of this type, the risk is to act emotively and without thinking all that much, and therefore without any balance in decision making, which may have undesirable consequences. I believe that what the Commissioners explained to us, the ten points that Commissioner Oettinger set out, is a very important and interesting approximation of the problem, and that it is along the right lines. There is a need to act forcefully with regard to civil responsibility and partnership, arrive at joint positions with the International Maritime Organisation, harmonise the legislation of Member States better, etc., but this needs to be done in such a way that the actions we take do not have any undesirable consequences. What needs to be done therefore needs to be assessed very well, including economically, together with its impact. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, many fellow Members have wondered why the Lisbon Agenda failed and whether we should start by analysing that failure in order to take the next steps. In my view, the problem with the Lisbon Agenda was that it was ultimately nothing more than a symbol enclosed in a bubble, which was not implemented at all in practice. In the end we found that on the one hand there was a theory, the Lisbon Agenda, about which we were all talking, and on the other hand there was the practice, which had nothing to do with it. Therefore, in my view, based on this experience the Europe 2020 strategy must be a new agenda that can only be taken forward if there is a resounding commitment – I would stress, a resounding commitment – from all the institutions: the European political institutions and the national political institutions. This commitment also needs to be one that can be verified and evaluated; it needs to be one that we have information about and an immediate capacity to correct if the commitments are not being fulfilled when there are failures. This is so that we do not find ourselves in any situation of extreme circumstances. Either we all understand that this joint project needs these instruments in order to move forward, or we will soon be in a similar situation. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, this is a debate on an issue on which there is generally a great deal of agreement, so it is not one of those debates in which there are radically different positions, but rather the positions are different in simple terms. We heard this in the speech by Mr López Garrido, and in the speech by the Commissioner, and it is reflected in the resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow in Parliament with the support of all the political groups. Having said this, there are a series of problems to resolve before electric cars can be fully efficient, and the task that we now have in front of us is to focus on seeing how we can resolve these problems as soon as possible so that electric cars can also become part of the whole project of having more sustainable and efficient energy consumption. In this respect I would like to highlight one of the issues that has been mentioned, which is also in the resolution, which is the issue of research. There are still a series of fundamental problems linked to the efficiency of the batteries and recharging, as well as the problems of standardisation, interoperability, and so on, which have a long way to go. In order for this ground to be covered as soon as possible, I think that it is essential, as in so many other aspects linked to energy and other issues, that efforts are focused on research. This does require an enormous effort from a financial point of view, both from the European institutions and from the national institutions. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Madam President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso – who is not here, but whom I am also addressing – the truth is that it has been very good to see you together and, in my opinion, this is because we have seen that there is a move towards and a focus on what should be the foundations of the common strategy in the next ten years and, in my view, this is extremely important. What most interested me about the proposal that we have seen in writing and what you have said is that there only need to be a few objectives: only the top-priority objectives; that they need to be tangible, that we need to be able to measure them and they need to be constantly evaluated in order to see whether or not we are making progress in that direction. I think this is fundamental, and it is a substantial change from the Lisbon Strategy. I am going to highlight one objective: the internal market. The European internal market was conceived more than 20 years ago. Twenty years later, there is a long way to go before we have a truly internal European market in the majority of sectors. In some cases, this is because they are very new sectors, such as the digital market, but in other cases, there is such a degree of fragmentation and such barriers that we are depriving the European economy of the large-scale framework that it needs in order to be able to really develop all the competitiveness that it needs, which will bring about growth, which, in turn, will bring about employment. Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, we need a great deal of political impetus: ‘business as usual’ can no longer be a tool. We need a great deal of leadership, and you have a big responsibility. You do, of course, have my full support for making this possible. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, I would firstly like to recognise the effort made, and also the enthusiasm shown by both the Commission and the Council and, of course, Parliament over such a long period throughout this programme to combat climate change. I would like to say that there are a series of certainties that should map out our route for us. The first one is this: we need everyone to take part, especially all the countries that are major polluters. The second near-certainty is this: based on all the information we have, it appears that it will be very difficult for a legally binding agreement to be reached in Copenhagen, in the same way as the agreements on the percentage of emissions are, of course, binding. This reality should not, however, cause us to give up, because pessimism results from failing to acknowledge reality. On the contrary, optimism is based on acknowledging reality. What should we do in Copenhagen, essentially? Of course, we should not forget the possibility of reaching that general agreement. As we are aware of the situation and the possibilities that exist, however, I think we should concentrate on sectoral agreements that are really valid, with viable objectives. I have in mind an agreement on deforestation, an agreement on aid for emerging countries and developing countries, but most importantly, an agreement on technology transfer. I also think it would be an extremely good idea to have agreements to promote programmes so that the industrial sectors that consume the most energy worldwide can reach agreements on emissions, whichever country they are in. This would also make our economies more competitive. To conclude, I would like to stress that optimism is based on realism and effectiveness is based on setting viable objectives. This should be our guide at all times. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks to my fellow Members, and in this case, mainly to the rapporteur, Mrs Trautmann, because she has really done an extraordinary job. You had to be there to know how much was achieved in this final stage, which resulted in success in the conciliation process. I would say that at the moment, we are in an excellent position to begin to tackle a future that is, in a sense, revolutionary, or should be revolutionary. We finally have – or we are soon going to have – a regulatory framework that lays some very good foundations for putting the development of the internet, the digital society and the digital economy at the forefront of our objectives. This framework provides good protection for consumers, promotes their rights and also provides security for investors. I think, however, that it is very important for us to now look decisively towards the future. We must look decisively beyond 2010 so that we can devote all our efforts to setting a digital agenda beyond 2010. The key objectives of this digital agenda should include: enabling everyone, as consumers and citizens, to have all the resources needed to access and participate through the internet and, of course, developing an internal digital market that is open and competitive. This is an absolutely essential objective if we want to put the European economy where it should be in the global world of today. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

– (ES) 
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission. With regard to the subject that we are debating, there are some certainties and a set of uncertainties. The first certainty, or the first common element, is that there is now a major convergence of opinion that emissions need to be reduced and that clean energy sources need to be developed. The second certainty is that there needs to be a global approach to or way of dealing with the problem. Therefore, the countries that emit the most CO2
 into the atmosphere need to take part in all international agreements. The major producers of CO2
 include the United States, China, India and Brazil. The third certainty is that the European Union is putting a proposal on the table that is an obligatory system of targets: 20% or 30%. The fourth certainty is that there are no reasonable signs, for various reasons, that the major CO2
 emitting countries are going to accept an agreement of this nature, and that is the reality. There is not such a lack of optimism if we acknowledge the reality; pessimism wins the day if we do not know the reality. It is only by acknowledging the reality that we can create an effective policy, and it will be a more optimistic policy. I think that the European Union, as it takes the lead on this issue, has a duty to put additional measures and additional proposals on the table. Japan has been mentioned here, and we have to talk about the success of projects such as the Sector Focus project, which affect the most polluting industries. On the basis of a process of benchmarking, such projects have achieved extraordinary objectives in Japan. These are the realistic ways of tackling climate change. Copenhagen is an opportunity, but it will only be an opportunity for efficiency rather than rhetoric if we base it on reality. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being very clear in your explanation of the current situation in relation to Nabucco and its potential and viability – seemingly in the short term, according to what you said – and also for the information on the Desertec project. There can be no doubt that the Sun is an extraordinary source of energy. Converting this energy into energy that can be used by people is an area which has seen major developments in the last 20 years. However, there is also no doubt that we still have a way to go before the full potential and viability of this source can be technologically assured, particularly in projects such as the Desertec project which we are now discussing. This project is very welcome and we must therefore support it and keep moving forward in order to solve the technological problems. However, I must really draw your attention to the fact that, when talking about energy efficiency, and particularly about security of supply and therefore diversification of energy sources, one particular energy source is ignored to a certain extent. I am of course talking about nuclear energy. This energy source is systematically being discriminated against, because it does not fit with what is happening in many EU countries or with global trends or with mankind’s current energy needs. This situation must be turned on its head. We must adopt an attitude of considering all possible energy sources in terms of the role that they can play. Here in this Parliament we cannot so obviously turn our backs on this reality. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to use this minute to mention the tragic consequences of the heavy rains which have fallen in southern and south-eastern Spain, particularly in the region of Valencia, Murcia and part of Andalusia. There was torrential rainfall on 28 September 2012 which caused very considerable damage across the whole agricultural sector. Thousands of hectares of crops were flattened, and many farms were completely ruined. The livestock sector also suffered losses, and damage was caused to the municipal road network, to street lighting, homes, buildings, and to industrial and commercial premises. I would also like to stress the difficulties which were already being experienced in Lorca, a town which, as you know, suffered a powerful earthquake a year ago, along with Puerto Lumbreras. Those two towns, those two Spanish municipalities in the region of Murcia, and all those in these and other regions, are seeking the solidarity of the European Union in order to be able to carry on.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.

 Madam President, the coastal regions, seas and oceans are undoubtedly of fundamental importance for the economic growth of the European Union and all its Member States. Following the Commission’s communication, an ‘Action Plan for an integrated maritime policy for the European Union’, known as the ‘Blue Book’, we are now in the current situation where the idea of an integrated maritime policy is welcome, and what it does and aims to do is certainly to make better use of the opportunities the sea provides. They know that this idea will form the basis for specific environmental and maritime transport policies which are so important for all these areas and for energy, research, fishing and regional policies. All of these aspects are, of course, vital for all these regions. I myself, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, fully support the proposal for a regulation and, furthermore, we believe that the EUR 40 million allocated for the current 2011-2013 period is sufficient. I should also like to say that it would be necessary for this funding to continue into the future, after 2014, since we need to consolidate the process that has been initiated and thereby ensure the continuation of such a promising course of action. I should also like to say that there should be a consistent approach to all the seas within the European Union so that we can see the range of projects and gain real first-hand knowledge of what the issues are in each sea basin. Clearly, the problems of the North Sea are not the same as those of the Mediterranean; hence, it would be valuable to adopt a consistent approach in order to discover more about this diversity. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the various opinions that have been drafted to finalise a programme which we see as of great importance for the future of the European Union.

Madam President, 80 million people, 16% of the population of the European Union, suffer from some kind of disability. This is why Mr Kósa’s report is so timely. It is an important report that discusses the European Disability Strategy and analyses it in detail. I would like to highlight three ideas in this report. The first of these is inclusive education, which is necessary so that each student’s individual characteristics can be taken into account, as required by Article 24 of the United Nations Convention. The second idea is the need for the employment market to open up to people with disabilities, so that we can meet the Europe 2020 strategy target of 75% employment. The third idea is that the economic crisis must never be an excuse to discriminate against disabled people. Lastly, other significant ideas in the report include a single European mobility card that would allow all benefits and rights to be mutually recognised in the Member States, and a similarly unified travel card to consolidate our efforts to help this group.

 Mr President, on 29 June this year the Majorcan pilot Antonio Planas, who was 49 years old, lost his life, the victim of a Taliban terrorist attack, along with 20 other people in Kabul. Antonio was married and he was the father of an eight-year-old girl. He worked for a Turkish airline and his death took place outside the EU. I am using this minute to point out that all those Europeans who are the victims of a terrorist attack outside the EU do not qualify for the forms of compensation that they would qualify for if the attack had taken place within a Member State. Imagine the position of Antonio’s daughter and his widow: they are victims of terrorism but they cannot enjoy the same rights as if the attack had taken place in Spain. Therefore, I would like to seek protection for all those Europeans who are the victims of terrorism when the death takes place outside the territory of the EU. In Spain a law is being formulated, the law for the recognition and comprehensive protection of victims of terrorism, which appears to be capable of correcting that grave error and of rehabilitating and protecting all victims of terrorism equally, in favour of memory, dignity, justice and truth, which are doubtless the ideas that underlie the law itself.

 Mr President, cohesion policy has undoubtedly contributed to increased productivity in all regions of the EU and to eliminating regional disparities and there is no doubt that it has proved fundamental for all citizens and that it is helping – and will continue to help – to combat the economic and financial crisis Europe is suffering. This is why the fifth cohesion report is so timely. There are three key ideas. The first is that gross domestic product should be supplemented by other indicators on the part of national and regional authorities. The second idea is that there should be an intermediate category so that all regions that do not come under convergence and do not manage to achieve competitiveness can be treated in a similar way when similar situations arise and so that these regions do not ever suffer a sudden change. The third idea is to reinforce Objective 3. I wish to make two requests. The maximum distance of 150 kilometres should be removed to enable many regions such as, for example, the Balearic Islands to access cross-border cooperation. My second point is that the report says that the working languages of the EU are French, English and German. That is not so. The 23 languages of the EU are what make us rich and diverse.

 Madam President, in January, the European Commission approved the strategy to tackle early school dropout as a key contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy to fight the school dropout problem across the entire European Union and reduce rates by at least 10%. Strangely, this strategy does not make any reference to disabled people, and this is why I would like to use this minute to make an appeal, since the education ministers of all the Member States will be meeting in Brussels on 2 and 4 May to discuss the global strategies around this issue. I would like to ask that the issue of disabled people be included within this strategy, because it is of fundamental importance for this group of people all over Europe to receive continuous education and therefore to be able to access the labour market. Article 24 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that disabled people are not, under any circumstances, to be excluded from the general education system.

Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the working group led by the chair of the Committee on Regional Development, which has made it possible for us to have this debate today. We certainly all agree that cohesion policy is the essential element for achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and also for achieving European integration and achieving the economic, social and territorial cohesion set out in the Treaty of Lisbon that people are clamouring for so much. What we need to start doing now, in my view, is to see what mistakes we have made and improve what we have done so far. We all agree that the process needs to be much more flexible, there need to be fewer bureaucratic obstacles, and the controls need to be simpler. Also, the regions with specific difficulties, such as islands, mountainous areas, cross-border regions and outermost regions, must receive specific treatment. Gross domestic product must continue to be the main criterion, although there might be other indicators in other decision-making processes, and the regions and local bodies must play a fundamental role. It seems that we all agree on this. So we are going to go down this road, but the Commission should clarify for us whether this is indeed the road we should go down or whether it should be another one. It needs to clarify whether we are going to have the same budgets, which is absolutely essential in order for no one to lose out and for all the regions to be able to make progress in terms of innovation, competitiveness, development, income and progress, especially in a time of crisis when clarity is needed more than ever.

Mr President, I would first of all like to thank all those who signed this motion for a resolution, which is welcomed extremely warmly by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and in Spain, the country that we represent. We have the legal framework, which is Article 174(3) of the Treaty of Lisbon. We also have territorial cohesion, which is the new pillar that is set out in that treaty, and therefore we have the legal basis to step out and help these regions: mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas. In the case of mountain regions – as has been said here – we are talking about 90 million inhabitants; in the case of islands, there are 21 million people living on islands in 14 countries, and many millions more live in mountain regions. All of these areas share a very similar set of problems in terms of culture, education, transport and the environment. Specifically, there is one disadvantage that unites us all, which is in terms of transport. I come from the Balearic Islands, where the additional cost of transport has been calculated at 20%. This undoubtedly has repercussions on our industry, agriculture, strategic sectors, tourism and, in short, on the whole business sector: the entire economic fabric. It therefore affects our competitiveness. Therefore, if we then focus on resources, such as drinking water or land, which is limited, or raw materials such as energy or the living spaces in those areas, we will see that they undoubtedly result in a phenomenon of shortages and of a lack of economic diversification. We are therefore calling for the new financial perspectives to take into account the specific characteristics of these areas and for us to move from words to action – as has also been said here – which should be translated into budgets, and hence into greater territorial cohesion. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

Madam President, Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives the European Union responsibility for economic, social and territorial cohesion, and for solidarity between the Member States. That cohesion and, in particular, territorial cohesion, is therefore one of the Union’s main objectives in order to ensure harmonious development and remove regional disparities. The Treaty of Lisbon also mentions supporting the island regions. I am speaking because the Spanish Government has announced a cut in the subsidy for discounting flights to the Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla for residents. In other words, it intends to cut into discounts for residents. Residents of these regions see air travel as essential. It is not optional, but rather they depend on it as it is their only means of contact with the outside world, and therefore maintaining discounts will ensure that those regions have equal opportunities and can compete. I ask Parliament to support this territorial cohesion and I trust that it will make the Spanish Government reconsider removing these discounts. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

 Mr President, we approved the Lisbon Agenda with its very ambitious objectives in 2000. Some of these have been met, but a lot of them have not. There is no doubt that the regional funds contributed to the Lisbon Strategy. Ten years on, we find ourselves shaken by the worst economic crisis we can remember. I believe that this crisis has served to enable us to identify, in this new Europe 2020 strategy, where we went wrong, as well as enable us to improve so as to achieve better results. Firstly, we have learned that coordination between all governance levels is essential, as is clearly stated in Mr Cortés Lastra’s report. We have also learned that the contribution of regional funds is essential to meeting the objectives we are proposing. We believe that the combination of specific actions at all levels – European Union, national, regional and local authorities – is an absolute necessity. If we work together, we will be much stronger. It is also important that a Cohesion policy covering economic, social and territorial aspects be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy. I would also like to make an observation as regards the Cohesion policy issue here, namely that the bureaucratic procedures should be much more flexible and efficient. Furthermore, in the disability sector, that difference will have to be taken into account in some way. Finally, I would like to underline the important role to be played by European regions and towns and cities, and especially, the need to pay more attention to those areas with special needs, such as mountain areas, coastal areas and islands. In short, if we want to be successful, we have to be able to count on the European regions, the towns and the cities and on a reformed Cohesion policy in line with the new situation.

 Mr President, the closure of a large part of European airspace over recent weeks following the eruption of the Icelandic volcano has had serious consequences for the entire European economy. This is clearly the case for the passengers, airlines and airports of the aviation sector, but it is also true for the tourism sector. That is what I wanted to talk to you about. In Spain, this is our second-largest industry. In the islands I hail from, it is the main industry. There is huge concern for the effects of the volcanic cloud on the tourist industry. There is talk of losses of EUR 42 million a day. It has dealt a serious blow to the tourism sector, which is still concerned about what the future repercussions may be. Mr Tajani, the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship, has committed himself to study the losses in this sector. My request today would be for an urgent relief package both for these airlines and for the other businesses in the tourism sector, and for the tourism sector to be treated as a priority. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor to highlight and condemn implementation of the Spanish Government’s Law on the Coastline, in particular, its effects on the island of Formentera. Formentera is one of the Balearic Islands. It is 19 kilometres long and has a perimeter of 69 kilometres. The implementation of this law will be positive in areas devastated by urban development. It will not, however, be beneficial for the island of Formentera, because it requires the elimination of most of the island’s tourist facilities, which means small family businesses will be seized. These facilities are the island’s livelihood and have been legally established for between 30 and 40 years. By way of example, I could mention the Hotel Rocabella, which was the first hotel on the island, or the bar and restaurant known as the Blue Bar, which is internationally renowned and has helped to promote the island abroad. Seventy per cent of these facilities would be affected by the implementation of the aforementioned law, despite having been established legally when they were set up. All this law would do would be to permit seizure. We therefore call for a fair demarcation system for the island of Formentera. I call on the Spanish Government to undertake a new demarcation, respecting private property, in line with the many rulings on the subject by the Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. Never again should a law like this one with retroactive effect be drawn up. It is causing a great deal of damage. In particular, it should be borne in mind that all these facilities were built with respect for the environment. Furthermore, the coast is protected under national and local legislation. It is not possible to build within 300 metres of the coast or to increase the amount of hotel accommodation. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate Mr Goerens on his excellent report. The Agenda for Change is an important roadmap for redefining development cooperation and for striving for better quality and effectiveness of aid, particularly in view of current changes in the new world order, the emergence of new international actors and the necessary process of fiscal consolidation into which we are forced by our current economic situation. We are pleased that the Commission is making poverty a core element of its differentiation policy. However, we deplore the fact that gross national income has been adopted as the key indicator for implementation of that policy. Mr President, 70 % of the people in this world whose income is below the poverty threshold live in middle-income countries. If we want to have a real impact on reducing this poverty, we need to take into account, in addition to wealth, other criteria such as the vulnerability of some of those countries, the lack of internal cohesion or the human development indicator. Many of these countries could also be key players today through triangular or South-South cooperation mechanisms, not to mention drivers of development for the future. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

 Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Cortés Lastra on his excellent report. Latin America is one of the regions of the world that has grown the most in recent years. As its largest global donor, the European Union has made a significant contribution to that development, and this is not the time to suddenly cut off our aid, but rather to do so gradually, so that those countries can consolidate their rule of law and continue to reduce their poverty figures. We need to maintain the levels of cooperation aid to Latin America as, despite achieving regional growth figures of more than 4%, it has the largest pockets of poverty in the world and the greatest levels of economic and social inequality. The European Union and Latin America share common values and interests and must move forward together in order to face up to the global challenges facing our societies, which are now more interdependent than ever.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the tragedy of Mali is the chronicle of a death foretold. One year ago, I had the honour of being the chief observer of an EU election observation mission in Niger; the Nigerien authorities – who knew exactly what they were talking about – and the few ambassadors posted there warned the European governments that there would be terrible consequences for all the Sahel countries if the Tuaregs, who formed part of Gaddafi’s army of mercenaries, returned. They said that those armed Tuaregs would unite, in particular, with their supporters in those countries and also with forces of the al-Qaeda organisation in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM); they also warned that AQIM had infiltrated the Libyan rebels. Baroness Ashton, I am very pleased about the measures you announced for all the Sahel countries, but I would just say that those measures need to be taken urgently and quickly because otherwise, we are going to be facing a truly pressing problem. Most of those countries could soon come under the control of the fundamentalist AQIM forces, all of which will be happening on Europe’s doorstep. I should not like to finish without mentioning all those people who have been abducted by AQIM, and I urge you to take all possible measures to bring about their swift liberation.

 Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Ms Vassiliou, my colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education and the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for the fruitful work we have done together over the past few months. Today the sports world is mourning those who died at a football match in Egypt. I would like to express my strong condemnation, and to remember the victims and their families. While drawing up this report I was in constant contact with the sports world, hearing people’s concerns and trying to reflect the issues on which the EU is being asked to express its opinion. The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has caused a revolution in the sports world because, for the first time, it was given its own legal basis, in Article 165. The first response to the Treaty was the Commission communication entitled ‘Developing the European Dimension in Sport’, which follows the guidelines set out in the 2007 White Paper. Parliament responded with an own-initiative report of the same name. The report was approved by the Committee on Culture and Education by 28 votes in favour and 2 votes against. I would like to highlight two concepts related to sport, of which I was very aware when writing the report. Firstly, the principle of subsidiarity, which recognises the competences of Member States and, secondly, the concept of the specific nature of sport, as mentioned in Article 165. However, this is not a universal principle, but rather one that must be analysed and approved on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the autonomy of governance structures in sport should be respected as a fundamental principle for its organisation. Allow me to briefly highlight some points made in the report. First of all, volunteering, when thousands of citizens selflessly take part to ensure that countless sporting events can be held. We must give them our unconditional support. Secondly, doping. Doping substances are a blight on sport and society. We should educate people on prevention, convict traffickers, pursue cheats and harmonise sanctions between sports law and civil law, maintaining the greatest possible respect for sportspeople. The report urges Member States to treat trafficking in illegal substances in the same way as trafficking in illegal drugs and to adopt national legislation to this end. It is vital to support the practice of sport in schools, and we therefore call for sport to be part of their curriculum. At some point, sportspeople’s professional careers come to an end, and during their career they need to have access to high-quality academic training in order to later become integrated into the world of work. Unfortunately, racism, xenophobia and homophobia are present in sport, and it is therefore necessary to implement new measures to eliminate any signs of those threats at sporting events. I would like to stress the undeniable benefit that sport has on people’s health, leading to a significant reduction in public health spending. I would also highlight the importance of sport as a means of integration for the most vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and socially excluded groups, as well as for those with disabilities. Betting should be protected from unauthorised activities, and from suspected match fixing, in particular by recognising organisers’ property rights with regard to their competitions. The report also calls on Member States to take legal action against sports fraud. It is fundamentally important that commercial exploitation of audiovisual rights for sport competitions should be carried out on a centralised, territorial basis with a view to guaranteeing that revenues are distributed fairly between elite and mass-participation sport. I would like to draw attention to the proposal to establish a European Day of Sports and an Erasmus Sports Programme, and to protect indigenous sports as part of our cultural heritage. These are just a few of the issues dealt with in the report, and I hope I can count on Parliament’s support. Santiago Fisas Ayxela,  
rapporteur. – (ES) 
Mr President, I should like to thank all the Members who have spoken in this sitting. I am not going to waste a second refuting some of the lies that have been told today. Whoever is able to read should simply read the report. I would, however, like to finish by stressing the importance of sport for a variety of vital social issues such as the integration of the most vulnerable groups, public health, education, employment and the economy. We should remember that sport in Europe represents, whether directly or indirectly, 15 million jobs – that is, 5.4% of the active population – and an annual added value of EUR 407 billion, which is 3.65% of European GDP. For this reason, because sport is so important, I welcome the Commission’s initiative and support, and I would also venture to ask the Commissioner whether Structural Funds could be applied specifically to sport. Above all, I would like to thank the main political groups in this House for their support. Thanks to the support shown by those groups, I hope that this report will be adopted in tomorrow’s vote.

 Madam President, fortunately the Libyan opposition has successfully confronted Muammar Gaddafi’s dictatorship, with the help of the international community. Now Gaddafi must be caught and judged for the crimes, violations of human rights, and possible crimes against humanity that he may have committed. The most important thing of all at the moment is to focus our efforts on rebuilding the country and endeavour to help Libya become a democratic state based on the rule of law. There are certain vital elements for ensuring the country is secure and viable: establishing the normal functioning of infrastructures, particularly where water, electricity and oil are concerned; maintaining public order by means of a police force; and effectively collecting all the weapons that have been distributed throughout the country. We should also remember the importance of supporting the Sahel countries: on the one hand, to avoid the extremely serious consequences for their security if mercenaries return and pro-Gaddafi forces flee to those countries; on the other hand, to support their institutions, which are enabling displaced persons from Libya to make an orderly return to their homes. Finally, I believe that the deployment of a United Nations mission to the country would be key to achieving the objectives mentioned. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

Madam President, Lady Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to refer to the case of Libya in particular. Among all the Maghreb countries, the situation of Libya seems to me especially worrying since it is at the gates of Europe and has abundant oil reserves. We have been at war a long time and the situation appears to be stagnating. I believe that the EU should do everything possible to achieve two objectives: that Colonel Gaddafi leaves the country and, also, that Libya enjoys a stable situation and becomes a democratic state, and does not run the risk of degenerating into a failed state which could be infiltrated by al-Qaeda, which would be a very dangerous and worrying situation for Europe. Furthermore, an ungovernable state, the massive return of emigrants to their countries of origin and, above all, of armed Tuaregs, could cause a conflict situation in the neighbouring countries. Libya is an Arab state but, above all, it is an African state, and I think it is very important to take into account the opinion of the neighbouring states of the Sahel in connection with this country’s situation. If we are not capable of getting rid of Gaddafi and bringing this war to an end, maybe these countries have proposals that we should listen to. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

Mr President, as you know, Niger, one of the central countries of the Sahel region, is holding presidential and parliamentary elections at the end of this month. I think that Baroness Ashton’s decision to send a European Union delegation to those elections is an important gesture of support, and I want to thank her for thinking of me to chair it. I would first of all like to express my regret at the recent murder of two young French people in Niger at the hands of terrorists, not forgetting the Nigerien soldiers who died during the rescue operation. The population of the region clearly rejects violence and terrorism, as they are the first to suffer as a result, but they ask the European Union to do everything it can to help them to eradicate terrorist violence and, among other things, to provide weapons and training for their armed forces so that they can respond adequately to these terrorist incursions. In addition, despite having a great wealth of natural resources, Niger is one of the least developed countries in the world. The European Union must therefore work to establish an effective development cooperation strategy to help Niger and the whole region out of the difficult situation they are in. I think there is a great deal at stake for us in this area of the world, because it is not only its welfare, but that of Europe that is dependent on its stability, given its geographical proximity.

Madam President, thousands of Saharans left their cities and peacefully set up the Gdaim Izyk camp in order to demand better living conditions. The Moroccan security forces violently dismantled the camp and, as a result, serious riots broke out in Al Aaiún. The Moroccan armed forces killed a young Saharan, and a Spanish citizen died in unclear circumstances. There are currently no reliable figures regarding the number of deaths, injuries, disappearances or arrests during those riots. Moreover, numerous MEPs have been banned from entering the Sahara, along with journalists who are still having serious problems doing their work. Morocco is Europe’s friend and strategic ally, and it is not good to have doubts or misunderstandings between friends. If Morocco has nothing to hide, it must allow the clarification of what happened. Therefore, although it is true that the Moroccan Parliament has set up an investigative commission, I think it is essential that an international commission be set up, that European and politicians and journalists have freedom of access to the area and that the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara extend its mandate to the protection of human rights, both in the area controlled by Morocco and in the area controlled by Polisario. The Commission and the European governments, least of all the Spanish Government, cannot look the other way in response to this situation. Realpolitik
 must not be an excuse for turning a blind eye. They must request clarification regarding these serious events and ask Morocco and the Polisario to resume discussions as soon as possible in order to arrive at a peaceful agreement on the basis of the United Nations resolutions.

 Madam President, Judge Afiuni granted parole to Eligio Cedeño, in accordance with Venezuelan law and in line with the opinion of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions. This led to her incarceration in a maximum-security prison, in conditions that are putting her life in danger. President Chávez has publicly requested that the prosecutor seek the maximum penalty, and that the National Assembly pass a law to increase her sentence with retroactive effect. Amnesty International and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have indicated their great concern. This is not an isolated case, ladies and gentlemen. On the contrary, it demonstrates the autocratic and authoritarian drift of a regime that, alongside seemingly democratic elections, closes opposing media, orders confiscations and arrests political opponents, showing no respect for human rights and the rule of law. We have therefore requested that Judge Afiuni be freed immediately. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

 Mr President, the Sagrada Familia, 
the work of the brilliant, Catalonian architect, Antoni Gaudí, is a genuine icon of Barcelona throughout the world. It was declared to be a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) in 2005. Work is currently being done on the high-speed train that will cross the city by means of a tunnel that lies a mere four metres from the foundations of the Sagrada Familia. There are 38 technical reports opposing these works. The International Council on Monuments and Sites, a specialist Unesco body, has expressed its concern about the route. Moreover, the lower house of the Spanish Parliament adopted a motion on 22 June to ask for a precautionary suspension of the works and the setting up of a committee of experts that could propose another solution within a time limit of two months. I would like to ask what measures the Commission is going to take to preserve a building as emblematic as is Barcelona’s Sagrada Familia against the risk represented by the passing of the high-speed train?

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against poverty and the other Millennium Development Goals should unite us all. I therefore regret the fact that some political groups have introduced certain issues that might make it difficult to achieve that unanimity. They are moral issues, such as proposing abortion as a method of birth control, or economic issues, such as introducing a tax on currency transactions. I think that this tax would be very difficult to implement, control and collect, and if it were not adopted across the board, especially in the main financial blocks, transactions would be moved to the countries where it was not in force. I regret that the report, which contains many positive points, will not receive unanimous support from all the political groups because of these particular issues. Santiago Fisas Ayxela,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mexico has a major problem with drugs trafficking and drug-related violence. To address this situation, the Government of President Felipe Calderón has adopted a tough stance in order to achieve its eradication: he has taken the decision to temporarily mobilise the armed forces, a move which has had a significant impact on the number of people arrested, the destruction of drugs and the confiscation of weapons. The army has accepted all the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission, including those concerning the investigation of complaints about their own conduct. The Government also recognises that it needs to make substantial changes in the area of security and justice, and is implementing an ambitious reform of the justice system in order for it to be more transparent and to bring to justice those who commit crimes, while respecting human rights. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wishes to show its solidarity with the Mexican people in the fight against drugs trafficking, and we support President Calderón in his willingness to combat organised crime. Finally, I would like to express my satisfaction with this agreement, which unites the main political Groups of this Parliament. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,

 Mr President, today is a very important day for all victims, particularly victims of terrorism, because on 11 September 2001, more than 3 000 innocent people died in several terrorist attacks in the United States. We cannot forget those who died in London and Madrid, or the many victims of terrorism in Europe, such as those of the ETA terrorist organisation in Spain, my country. Society as a whole is the victim in a terrorist attack, but a few citizens pay with their lives to defend our freedom. That is why, Mr President, I am dedicating part of my speaking time, including the time I have been allocated at the end of the debate, to observe one minute’s silence for all of these victims. (The House observed a minute’s silence)
 I should like to thank Commissioner Reding for the sensitivity she has shown towards victims, also the Council for its flexibility, and Ms Parvanova for her excellent work, as well as the Members of Parliament who have followed this report. Tomorrow will be crucial not only for victims but for all citizens, and believe me when I say that anyone can become a victim, as we can see from this compelling statistic: 75 million people a year are victims of crime in Europe. I believe it is time to give the victims the place they deserve, that is, at the centre of our debates in Parliament, because, even though the economic situation is our main concern today, I know that in most European countries, people are extremely worried about the way the justice system functions. This directive, which sends a clear message to victims that their rights will not be ignored and that they will be treated with respect and dignity, will serve to build people’s confidence in justice. The response to victims’ call for justice begins in Europe: a transparent and effective framework that restores citizens’ rights and the hope they have lost, in some cases, in their judicial system. Irrespective of their nationality or the place where the crime was committed, the victims will have the right to be informed, to understand and be understood, to legal counsel, and to be heard and protected. Victim support services will be able to provide psychological support and defend the victims at all times. I have heard many victims’ accounts, all of which were very traumatic, but necessary in order to understand the needs of the different types of victims; I would like to add that I dedicate this directive to them, especially to my brother, Alberto, and his wife, who will be looking down on me from heaven. In Parliament today, we are taking an important first step towards helping a father who has lost his son in another country, the victim of an attack, or a girl who has been raped and has no idea where to begin or what to tell the police. They are forced to go through that nightmare, and we are helping all of them here today. I hope this compass guides not only victims when they are crossing the desert of criminal proceedings, but also all those who must support them on their path of pain, such as judges, police officers and legal experts, including in cases involving children, and I also dedicate this directive to them. Today is a very important day for all victims: victims of gender violence, people trafficking, terrorism, organised crime, as well as child victims, victims with disabilities, and all those who have experienced the ordeal of a crime. Unfortunately, we cannot bring back people’s loved ones, nor can we restore their honour, the peace of mind they have lost, or their health, but all of us here today can promise them that we shall continue working towards giving them back their rights, dignity and belief in justice. I am committing myself and I call on the whole of Parliament to do the same with me tomorrow. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I should like once more to thank all those who have made it possible for this directive to become a reality: the secretariat, the Commission, the rapporteur, all those I am forgetting to mention and all my fellow Members who have supported us. I should like to say to every single victim without exception that, for us, they and their families have faces, names and are real people, and it is specifically on their behalf that we will work to ensure this directive is truly effective and – with the commitment and support of Commissioner Reding, of which I have no doubt whatsoever – is quickly and efficiently implemented, which is what all of us, and all citizens, want. I think there are various victims’ associations that would have wanted, and continue to want, their own directive, but I will make sure they know that the directive we shall vote on tomorrow does not overlook a single victim and, therefore, does not overlook them either. I am certain that this is the first important step and that it will be followed by many other steps that will open the doors of justice, which have been closed to victims for too long. When I am asked, as I often am in my country, what I do in Europe, I will be able to say with great pride that I am legislating in support of victims. That work is a great honour to me personally, and it motivates me to continue working. I am sure that, with the support and commitment of all those who are not only working here in the EU but also in our own countries, as well as your support, ladies and gentlemen, together we will succeed in putting an end to the situation of unjust neglect in which victims find themselves.

 Madam President, I have been denouncing female genital mutilation since I became a Member of Parliament. This silent and accepted crime is suffered by millions of women and girls throughout the world: 70 million, I repeat, 70 million. An unbearable figure for those who stop to examine the terrible consequences of these practices, hidden under the guises of psychological, health, and religious reasons, all of which are false. The truth is that circumcision, preferentially practised on 14-year-old girls, and even those aged one year old, can lead to death by haemorrhagic shock and, at best, cause and bring about strong psychological consequences from the trauma. We should strive with all our efforts in Europe to eradicate this violation of human rights, which infringes on the right to equal opportunities and puts health at risk. It is, ladies and gentlemen, abuse, cruelty and torture against girls, and this degrading treatment also occurs in Europe. We must therefore activate all the available prevention mechanisms in our legal system and encourage our judges to act to prevent the genital mutilation of girls in Europe, punishing those who carry it out. EU law has to speak with a single voice to combat the mutilation on our soil. Lastly, I call on civil society and NGOs to become actively involved in education and prevention campaigns. There is still a long way to go, but we are a large group who will not give up, as we owe it to the 70 million mutilated women. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 Madam President, from the European Parliament I wish to pay tribute to all women today because, despite the fact that we have made much progress since March 1911, when women took to the streets to demand the vote and better working conditions, I think that women’s equality is still a long way away. Today women can work without having to get permission from anyone but, in many cases, they continue to earn less than men for similar work, which is unacceptable. We must also remember women in rural areas, whose work goes unnoticed. I think that another uncomfortable truth, but one which we must continue to denounce, is violence against women. This year alone an excessive number of women have already been murdered, leaving aside serious threats from those who believe they have the right to perpetrate physical or psychological violence against women. It is time to say enough and to say it loud and clear. From this Parliament I reiterate my commitment to the European protection order for victims and to the Directive on the rights of victims which the Commission put forward and which will be voted upon next June, God willing. It also has to be said, and I should like to remind people, that motherhood is still an obstacle to the progression of women and I think this is a trend that should be changed. I want to send a message of hope: many women, with the help of more and more men, need to advance along the path of equal opportunities, rights and responsibilities. We have come a long way but there is a lot left to do. I have to admit that I do not believe in quotas in any way, shape or form but I must say that something has to be done and I agree with many of you and, of course, with Ms Reding, in opening this debate and advancing along that path so that women regain the place that they deserve and to that end you can count on my support. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur. 
– (ES)
 Madam President, I am pleased to know that the European protection order will be put to the vote and, in all probability, ratified by a large majority in this Chamber tomorrow. I say that from the heart as, since I entered this Parliament, I have been loyal in my commitment to the victims in defence of their rights, and one of the basic rights of any victim is to be suitably protected. My commitment extends to all citizens, as we are all potential victims of crime and we have the need to be able to live in a world and a European area of freedom, justice and security. With your votes in favour, we will be legislating to make life easier for the victims, who will feel equally protected in any country of the European Union going forward, without the need to initiate a new legal procedure with every move. In summary, we will make it easier for the victims to move around and we will limit their aggressors’ movements, which I consider to be a big step forward that I am delighted to have been able to make as the rapporteur for this report. The time is already upon us to stop allowing crime to cross borders, placing our lives at risk. We have the right and duty to protect ourselves, and this tool will serve that purpose. Despite the difficulties and the path we have taken during these two years of negotiations, which has not always been smooth, I want to thank the Polish Presidency today for having skilfully driven the negotiations. I also want to thank the Commission which, thanks to the vision of Ms Reding on presenting the legislative package relative to the victims and an additional regulation in civil law, has finally managed to dispel the Council’s doubts about the convenience of supporting the European protection order, along with opening the door to more wide-ranging legislation for the rights of the victims of crime and their support, on which I am working with a great deal of hope. I want to thank my co-rapporteur, Ms Romero, and also the Secretariat. When we return to our countries and people ask us ‘What do you do over there in Europe?’, given that they view our work as so distant and incomprehensible, this time I will be able to tell them that we have at least created an instrument, which we have ratified in this parliamentary session, which will protect so many people that suffer violence. I offer this future law for the many women killed through male violence, the many innocent people that suffer human trafficking without the possibility of escaping from their aggressors, the many defenceless children, the victims of terrorism that live with their terror, those that run from organised crime, and the many that don’t know where to go for fear of being pursued. We have taken a big step today towards the defence and protection of those that are most in need. I would like to conclude my speech with three words that are the guiding light in my work and life: freedom, justice and dignity. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur. 
– (ES)
 Madam President, I think it is very important to closely follow the application of the European protection order. We refer to filing a report, but these reports should be followed by real protection. We need troops: we can approve good laws, but if we do not provide countries with the necessary means, the victims will not feel confident and they will continue to keep quiet for fear of being assaulted again. Therefore, it is necessary that the judges and the police have the training and means to be able to do their job properly. That is real justice. So many victims complain about the application of a law that does not meet their needs. It is necessary, therefore, that we pool our efforts, that we insist on the statistics to see how this instrument is working, which I believe is really necessary. I ask the Member States to make the effort to understand and apply this regulation, as that’s what we have worked for, and we consider that we have made it clear. I think that from now on, the doors to victim rights are wide open in Europe, that women and men can count on this, and other instruments, which will make victims come forward and put a stop to those that they fear. Today through our voices, and tomorrow through our votes, we will tell the victims that we will never forget their rights in the European Parliament, the support that society owes them, and mostly importantly, justice. I can tell you that it is justice that keeps all the victims alive, regardless of the crime committed against them. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
).

 Madam President, as rapporteur of the report on the drafting of a directive on the rights of victims of crimes, including terrorism, and as a Spaniard who has personally suffered the cruelty of the terrorist organisation ETA, I would like to thank President Buzek for his support for my country and its victims. I understand the pleasure that many people feel at this new statement from ETA, but I must remind you that it is still too soon to celebrate, because they have not yet handed over their weapons, nor disbanded, nor asked their victims for forgiveness. Ladies and gentlemen, it is also important for you to realise that we do not have to reach any kind of peace between the two sides in Spain, because there has not been a war. My brother, Alberto Jiménez-Becerril, who was murdered by ETA along with his wife in Seville, was not returning from war. He was going home, where his three children, who would never see him again, were waiting for him. We have the obligation to tell my brother’s children that his parents were better than their murderers. If we accept an end without winners or losers, we will be showing these children that you can achieve political objectives by killing. So I ask Parliament not to allow itself to be hoodwinked by the ETA terrorists and their accomplices, and to listen to the sincere voices of the victims. The only thing they want is the peace that comes from justice. (Applause) Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I would like to say to everyone that there is only one kind of terrorism, simply that which destroys innocent lives. Where it comes from is not an issue. The victims of terrorism, whom I represent, given that the ETA terrorist organisation killed my brother and his wife, share a common thread, and on their behalf, I would like to say that this report, with such a long title, could have been ambitious, but it is not. It is a disappointing outcome. This report does not represent us, it does not represent hopes for justice, or the balance between freedom and security that we talk about so much here. It does not represent us, and I believe that a report on terrorism should acknowledge the victims of terrorism, but this does not. Therefore, I ask you to vote against this report. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
).

 Mr President, in defence of fundamental rights, I call on the responsible institutions to review the designation of San Sebastián as European Capital of Culture, because I believe that it was chosen on the basis of political criteria, which constitutes discrimination against the other candidate cities. The chairman of the panel said the city was chosen to support the peace process but, as far as I am aware, there is a terrorist organisation in Spain, called ETA, that so far has not laid down its weapons and which two months ago managed to get its political wing, Bildu, into government in San Sebastián, as well as other towns. I do not believe that Europe should be giving such a powerful megaphone to people who fail to condemn terrorist violence and who will create propaganda out of apportioning blame between victims and murderers. Where is the right to freedom and dignity? Clearly not in San Sebastián, where our fellow Members such as Mayor Oreja, Mr Iturgaiz, Mr Zalba, and I myself have to go around with bodyguards. I believe in the culture of life, not in a bullet to the back of the head. Ladies and gentlemen, can there be any true culture without freedom? No, a thousand times no. San Sebastián should once again submit its candidacy when it is a city that is free for everyone. In the meantime, they should learn the culture of respect towards those who think differently, because although the city may deserve the title in future, today, with Batasuna and its successors in its institutions, it does not. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
).

Mr President, the most important thing, and that which is uniting us here today, are the victims, because nobody should feel as unprotected as we, the European consumers, feel at the moment. Furthermore, we need clarity and responsibility in respect of the victims. It is my responsibility to denounce the German authorities, who, wrongly and hastily, accused Spanish cucumbers and, more specifically, the cooperatives of Malaga and Almeria, which were model operations and which will not recover from these accusations. Thousands of jobless families are wondering why – and they need an answer – and, in particular, they want to know what the future holds for them, not just in Andalusia, but throughout European agriculture. Therefore, and in the hope that the experts will soon find the solution, I demand that today, when the Commission speaks to the Council, it asks for immediate and moral economic measures for all the producers from Andalusia and from the whole of Europe, who are looking towards us with indignation, but also with hope. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, on most occasions that I have spoken in Parliament, it has been to denounce violence against women, and I am here again to combat it. I must say that not only do I not tire of doing this, but I think that it is essential to continue to speak out in public about this violation of human rights, as you cannot defend a cause without a sounding board. Furthermore, this Parliament is the best loudspeaker available to me to defend all those women who suffer daily from abuse and who need us, as legislators, to compel the Member States to punish the perpetrators of this aggression in a manner that befits the seriousness of the crime, and also to provide assistance to the victims. When, according to estimates, one in four women in Europe has suffered gender violence at least once in her life, and the same proportion of children, I believe that we cannot but demand greater commitment, as has been recognised by the Commission in its action plan. I believe that we must keep on insisting, time and time again, in order to protect victims, as we did with the European Protection Order, for which I was rapporteur, and I hope that it will come into effect as soon as possible. This report has benefited from a great measure of consensus and support from the outset. This shows that when we tackle domestic violence, which affects all family members, including children, the elderly, women and men, this should not provide the opportunity for political opportunism, as it does us all great credit to be making progress towards finding a solution to this scourge of our society. The first thing we must do is to speak up, and the second is to get down to work, for, although we have spent decades speaking about gender violence, we have not managed to reduce the number of deaths. We must be doing something wrong, and therefore, it is time to leave demagogy aside and to move from words to actions. We must give more genuine assistance and apply the legislation that women need if they are to live in dignity and safety. I want all the victims to know that I shall always be here to speak up for them, until the day that, by working together, we manage to defeat this terrible enemy, which sadly ends the lives of so many innocent victims. What I say is: we have had enough. It cannot go on. I ask all of you to say likewise. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
).

Madam President, today is a very significant day to talk about equality between men and women because we are celebrating International Women’s Day, remembering those who fought for women’s working and economic rights and their right to vote 100 years ago. We have made considerable progress in those 100 years, but much remains to be done. True equality is still a dream and discrimination against women is a fact of life. I believe that every one of us, both men and women, can do a lot more to achieve true emancipation for women. There are many women in the world whose right to life is being threatened, whose dignity is being violated, and whose freedom is being denied. Allow me, on this International Women’s Day, to demonstrate my support and hope to all women fighting for their democratic rights in the revolution in North Africa. Women cannot be worth half what men are in Arab counties or anywhere in the world. We are worth the same and deserve the same. I will continue fighting to achieve that equality and International Women’s Day will continue to exist until it is achieved. Even if there are many who do not want to see it, the reality is that there are women who earn half of what men do and that domestic violence mainly affects women and children. I must repeat that these facts must continue to be reported in Parliament, and I promise to continue working toward that, of course. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
).

Mr President, while not wishing to take the comparison between terrorism and immigration too far, I have observed that unfortunately, EU action is driven by emergency situations, such as a serious attack or a mass landing of immigrants, as is currently happening in Lampedusa, where the exodus of Tunisians to the Italian coast could culminate in a chronicle of a death foretold. The voyage of hope could end up becoming a cursed voyage, and it will be on the consciences of all of us who witness these continuous uncontrolled influxes and do not say ‘enough is enough’ with sufficient authority. When it happens, we will throw up our hands in horror, but the following day we will forget about it. Europeans have a duty and a right to know the truth: that the Mediterranean strategy is not working, that the common immigration policy will continue to be a dream until European countries commit to equipping the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) with sufficient resources to be effective. Talking does not cost anything, but we need to act. Do you really believe that Frontex is currently able to guarantee the security of the European borders? I do not believe it is. Let us hope that the people of Egypt, Tunisia and other countries of the Maghreb do not decide en masse
 to seek a better future in Europe, but rather that they do so in their own countries, because that is what they have fought for, and we must help them. Solidarity and responsibility are therefore required, along with, above all, truth when talking about a common European immigration policy, which is now more necessary than ever. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, today is an important day for all victims, because today we shall adopt the European Protection Order, which is a significant step forward in terms of their rights. Victims are unfairly forgotten about, and it is paradoxical that aggressors often have many more rights and that there is more said about aggressors’ rights than victims’ rights. Today, Parliament will honour all victims, reminding those who believe that the borders will shield them while they persecute their victims, that this European Protection Order will protect all victims equally in the European Union from this day onwards. We started working more than a year ago to achieve this objective and make progress with the area of freedom and security that was mentioned in the Stockholm Programme, and today we can say with a degree of pride that, although the path has not been easy, as many people have frequently failed to understand the order, and doubted its effectiveness and clarity, we have achieved it. I must say that, following the trialogues with the Belgian Presidency, and many conversations with the Commission, we have achieved a text that almost all the political groups were happy with. This report was therefore adopted by a huge majority with no votes against in the joint vote by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. I hope that today, Parliament will reflect the decision made by those committees and by those of us who produced this report, which was adopted by a huge majority. This would send a clear message to the Council about what Europeans want, which is nothing more than to live in an area of security and justice, to be protected, and for a victim who has a restraining order against her aggressor in her country not to have to begin further court proceedings when she moves to another country. We have an obligation to facilitate access to justice for Europeans, and especially for victims, who are the most vulnerable. The protection of all victims, without exception, has been my beacon throughout the development of this report. I therefore wanted to include victims of terrorism, people trafficking, organised crime and honour crimes, along with a special chapter for minors, who are the most vulnerable victims, and we never think about how to protect them. Although this order will protect all victims, women who suffer from domestic violence will benefit most from this instrument for judicial cooperation, as their aggressors will not be able to travel through Europe with impunity, and will know that they will be pursued in the same way as in the country where they attacked their partners. Parliament must therefore send a clear message to the Council today about what we want. We will therefore vote with our eyes fixed on the victims, on those who suffer, on those who need us to protect them, on those who are afraid and need to live in freedom and hope. We are not going to give up on such a fair and necessary aim that is supported by the majority of Europeans just because there are some who are afraid and never dare to take that one step further. We need to be brave, the Member States need to be brave, and I hope that the vote today will be a majority in favour and encourage those who still have doubts as to whether this instrument will open a door for victims. I also hope that in the near future, the Commission will put forward wide-ranging legislation in favour of victims’ rights, for which it has my full support and, I am sure, Parliament’s support. I repeat: this small but major step that is the European Protection Order will improve protection for all victims, preventing further crimes and relieving the consequences of those that have already been committed. Today, we have an obligation to remove the obstacles that have so far prevented real protection across Europe. Through our vote today, we have the opportunity to save lives, which is what we are going to do, and we should be genuinely proud of that. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES) 
Madam President, I think that in this debate, we have clearly seen that we are all in agreement in supporting the objective of this report. The various political groups have shown their support for this directive, which offers greater protection to victims. My question is, therefore: what obstacles are there to adopting this instrument? I repeat: what fears are there regarding something as essential and simple as protecting victims equally across Europe finally becoming a reality? In the hope that Parliament will adopt this report by a majority, I would like to address the Council and the Commission to remind them that we have overcome the legal hurdles in our negotiations, and I welcome the fact that the Commission acknowledges our work, just as we acknowledge the work that it will do in the future. We should not therefore exclude ourselves, but rather help ourselves by adopting this more specific instrument today, and tomorrow by adopting the broader package of measures to help victims that will be presented by the Commission, with which I promise to cooperate. Let us therefore be brave and responsible, and let us help all those who have the right to live in a safer Europe. I repeat: let us help everyone, be they men, women or children. Let us help those who are looking to us today to give them a better life, a life that will restore to them their freedom, their security and, above all, their dignity. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I have asked for the floor to remind you of the importance of today’s vote in order to send a clear message to the Council, aimed at the countries that have still not equipped themselves with security in this field. I believe that today, we have an opportunity to defend victims and ensure that they can live without fear and in freedom. It is very important, not only for women, but also for men, children, victims of terrorism, victims of organised crime, victims of trafficking of women and for victims in general. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Mr President, last month, I organised a hearing in this Parliament concerning the victims of terrorism, which was attended by the President of Parliament and various Members of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). The victims have turned to us, as their representatives in Europe, to guarantee them their right to justice which has been trampled on so many times in their own countries, such as Spain, where the Rodríguez Zapatero Government continues to lie to the Spanish people about a negotiation process with a terrorist group which has still not relinquished its arms. It is because of this that such grave incidents as the Bar Faisán
 tip off, in which the terrorists were warned of the operation in progress to arrest them, have still not been thoroughly investigated. Democratic governments cannot turn their backs on the victims of terrorism; they have already paid the highest price in the fight for liberty. Parliament must push for a European Charter which recognises the legitimate demands of the victims, such as not negotiating with terrorists and ensuring that they serve their prison sentences in full. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Human Rights, as a Spanish and European citizen, and as a victim of terrorism since the terrorist organisation ETA murdered my brother and his wife in Seville, I am speaking here today to condemn the fact that the Venezuelan Government and its President has allowed ETA terrorists to train on Venezuelan soil on the orders of the alleged terrorist, Arturo Cubillas, who works for Hugo Chávez’s government despite the fact that there is an international warrant out for his arrest; this is a serious violation of the fundamental right to all European citizens’ right to security. I demand firm action from the Spanish Government in response to this serious humiliation of all the Spanish people. Mr Zapatero cannot continue to keep quiet while the Venezuelan Ambassador describes the members of our Civil Guard, who have been, and will continue to be, models of bravery in the fight against ETA, as torturers. Nor can he look the other way as cooperation on Venezuelan soil between ETA and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia grows, which has already been condemned by the Judge Eloy Velasco. Mr Zapatero cannot shake the hand of a leader such as Mr Chávez, who is turning Venezuela into a haven for terrorists. The Prime Minister of a country such as Spain, where terrorism has caused so much pain, cannot continue to ignore this problem and should give the response that such a situation deserves, which is what any ordinary citizen would do if they had the opportunity. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity in this House today, as I was unable to do so on the ‘European Day for the Victims of Terrorism’ on 11 March, to pay a well-deserved tribute to these victims in recognition of the enormous sacrifice made by those who have paid the ultimate price in the name of freedom. We urgently need to start to work on a directive to protect the rights of the victims of terrorism, who are always the ones who are overlooked and who suffer the humiliation of being unjustly equated with their murderers. It is high time that we within these European institutions recognise the dignity of the victims of terrorism, and help to defend their right to protection and justice. This right should soon be embodied in a law that honours all those who make this possible, whose first article should state that support to victims of terrorism entails recognition of their right to justice and that no government should ever pay a price for this. I call on all those in a position to defend the victims never to forget that true peace is a peace born of justice, and that is the only peace that those of us who believe in freedom and democracy in Europe and anywhere else in the world should defend. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to say that I did not come to Parliament to applaud the brand new law in Spain on abortion. What I am concerned about is human life, and I am particularly concerned about the women – who I am here to defend – whose lives are in danger as a result of gender violence, and I am here to offer them a space in which they can live freely and safely. Parliament’s Resolution of 2 February 2006 recommended that the Member States adopt an attitude of zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women, and that they adopt the necessary measures to ensure better protection for victims. The Stockholm Programme, which was adopted in this House, established an area of freedom, justice and security for all European citizens, and combating gender violence was considered to be a priority in that programme. This reflected my request for the Spanish Presidency to promote a European protection order for the victims of gender violence during its mandate, to ensure that the victims of these crimes have the same level of protection in all the Member States. In a Europe without borders, the fight against gender violence should also be without borders, and the Member States should work hard to harmonise their legislation so that the fight against ill-treatment of women overcomes the legislative obstacles in its way and we can finally protect the lives of women and their children, at least within the European Union, I therefore ask the Commission and the Council to do everything that is necessary and everything in their power to move forward with the European protection order for victims, which is a very effective instrument for ensuring that those who fail to respect the dignity of women and their right to live freely and safely do not go unpunished. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Mr President, when dealing with a topic as serious as terrorism, we should not wait for things to happen before we act. We should anticipate events, but we do not. Unfortunately, we only change in response to each attack, such as the failed attack in Detroit, which is forcing us today to take decisions to ensure the safety of air transport. Taking a decision on body scanners in airports is a responsibility that we cannot avoid, ladies and gentlemen. We cannot wait any longer because the terrorists are not waiting. Consequently, the Commission must guarantee, as soon as possible, that the dignity and privacy of individuals will be preserved and that there will be no harmful effects on health. Once this is guaranteed, we must adopt decisions for the European Union as a whole. To those who are worried about infringement of our fundamental rights, I say that there is no greater right than the right to life, and those of us who cherish freedom above all else must be able to live safely in order to feel truly free. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
).

 According to a United Nations report, in 2009, some 270 000 people were victims of human trafficking within the European Union. With these figures in mind, we need to ensure that European Union action is based, first and foremost, on victim protection, with special focus on the situation of women and children, who are the most vulnerable. We cannot continue to stand by and remain indifferent to the play that is being enacted, to the sideshow of sexual exploitation that is unfolding before our eyes. For this reason, I completely support the Parliament’s demands that victim assistance should be unconditional and that more forceful methods and more severe penalties should be adopted, as Mr Barrot has just told us. Having said that, I would like to call on the Spanish Presidency, the European Commission and the Council to use all the European legislation at their disposal, both existing and future legislation, to protect the victims of human trafficking. I consider that the proposed European victim protection system, which I personally demanded from the Spanish Presidency during the Stockholm Programme debates, and which has finally come to fruition, will be an effective instrument for fighting such crimes. I hope for a firm undertaking, as we have already seen, from the Spanish Presidency, to ensure that this system offers victims special protective measures that will be effective throughout the European Union. I hope that we who are responsible for taking action against the most severe problems in our society will come up with a real and substantial response to this extremely severe problem of human trafficking and that our words will not be empty promises. We really owe it to all the victims. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to say that the majority of governments and citizens only remember the victims of terrorism after a serious attack such as the ones in Madrid, New York or London. Once the wave of emotion has passed, they tend to forget about the terrorist threat and the rights of victims. Today, however, there is no doubt about the European Union’s commitment to the fight against terrorism. As Commissioner Barrot has just told us, this commitment has also been reflected in the recently adopted Stockholm Programme, which recognises the courage and dignity of the victims and the need to defend their rights. Despite this progress, the fight against terrorism has always been based on trust and mutual cooperation between the Member States. Taking into account the perspective offered by the Treaty of Lisbon, I wonder whether it would be a good idea for the European Union to promote harmonisation of the legislation of the Member States on the rights of victims of terrorism. The adoption of a European charter of the rights of victims of terrorism would be a big step forward that would help those fighting terrorism and would be a strong blow for those that defend it. It is the courage and dignity of the victims that is the greatest failure of terrorism and therefore the greatest triumph of democracy. We should never forget that the only weapon that innocent victims have against terrorism is their word and the recognition of society. Therefore, you should also not forget, ladies and gentlemen, that none of us are safe from being victims of terrorism. My question is, therefore: would the Commission agree with adopting a European charter to recognise the defence of the rights of the victims of terrorism and to promote those rights? If so, what measures would the new Commission take to drive forward this Charter under its new mandate? Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Mr President, today there is no doubt about the European Union’s commitment to the fight against terrorism, and thanks to the Stockholm Programme, we will continue to make progress on this essential area of freedom, security and justice. In my view, this fight has been based on mutual trust between the Member States, but now, with the possibilities opened up by the Treaty of Lisbon, it is high time to harmonise national legislation so that there is no time limit on prosecuting terrorist crimes, which should be considered as crimes against humanity. When this happens, nobody in this Parliament or in any other will defend terrorists, as has happened, is happening and may continue to happen, to the detriment of victims of terrorism, who watch those who murdered their loved ones being treated like heroes, while they suffer in silence. I therefore ask Parliament to drive forward or adopt a European charter for the rights of the victims of terrorism, based on defending the memory… (The President cut off the speaker) Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate you as the Commission’s proposal on the employment package is very important. It is an ambitious and difficult challenge in the context of the current crisis, but we have to achieve the objective of the Europe 2020 strategy and create new jobs. To achieve this objective, the job markets need to be reformed so that they are more dynamic and inclusive, with workers trained in appropriate skills so they are more resistant to economic adjustment processes, and make full use of their potential for job creation during growth periods. Hiring needs to be stimulated through tax incentives that: promote and support self-employment and business start-ups, back innovative sectors with a high potential for job creation, improve the job market situation for the most vulnerable groups, such as young people and women, and fight against informal or non-declared employment. It is also important to note, however, that despite the high unemployment rate, there are increasingly more vacancies to be filled due to a lack of personnel with the appropriate skills. This gap needs to be filled by better planning for the needs of the job market and encouraging geographical mobility. In this sense, decisive progress needs to be made towards the creation of a European job market. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, our objective in the area of employment and social issues should continue to be the Europe 2020 strategy. Unfortunately, however, and partly due to the erroneous policies of previous governments, there are some countries, including my own, where there is no longer any room to manoeuvre and the only option left is to apply very rigorous budgetary adjustment programmes to tackle the sovereign debt crisis. Unemployment has reached unacceptable levels and continues to rise in some countries, with young people in a particularly serious situation. Poverty and the risk of social exclusion have increased considerably. There is a greater need than ever to redirect spending towards growth and job creation, and to avoid cutbacks in social policies that would further exacerbate the situation faced by the weakest in society. Fiscal consolidation is a necessary condition, but it is not enough to exit the crisis. Fiscal consolidation, growth and job creation should go hand in hand. The priority elements of national programmes and European Union social policy should be integrated, active inclusion strategies, measures to support sustainable job creation, particularly for the young, and, ultimately, carrying out the necessary reform of our labour markets, as is currently taking place in Spain. Veronica Lope Fontagné,

 Madam President, Commissioner, poverty is the cause of the great inequalities on our planet. We cannot accept a system in the 21st century that continues to exacerbate differences between people because of their place of birth, gender, or their country’s development prospects. It is vital to create a new social, employment and economic framework that will ensure the basic needs of our population. Around 80 million people live below the poverty line, of whom more than half are women and 20 million are children. The platform that is the subject of this report could help to achieve greater social justice in Europe. It calls for priority to be placed on education and youth policies as a key element around which to build a fairer and more just society; for an overhaul of the insecure employment contracts that have proliferated in many Member States, undermining protection of the weakest groups in society; for the recognition of the rights of women living in rural areas, whose work is not valued and who are excluded from the basic rights enjoyed by all workers; and for an improvement in national home care programmes for the elderly. The austerity measures that are so badly needed at this time of crisis must not be incompatible with maintaining basic social services. Some 116 million people are threatened by poverty in the European Union, and 42 million live in conditions of severe material deprivation. We must ensure these people’s social protection and create a more prosperous environment that will help to reduce these figures. Lastly, I would like to say how pleased I am with the Council’s decision, following several months of stalled negotiations, to release food aid for the poorest members of society. It is essential to maintain this economic support in the new 2014-2020 funding cycle, with an annual maximum amount of EUR 500 million. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, at a time when Europe is experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis, with unemployment at 9.5%, I think it is very positive to discuss the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs today, and I want to congratulate Ms Bastos on the quality of her report, which forms part of the Europe 2020 strategy and will make a key contribution towards achieving the ambitious target of a 75% employment rate within the European Union. The 23 million unemployed Europeans demand that institutions and governments take the necessary measures and adopt the reforms that guarantee competitiveness in the job market and the creation of jobs. This agenda is on the right track, and we will only achieve this aim by working together within a strengthened single market. I want to make a specific reference to one of the sectors that create most jobs within the Union, and which is suffering the most at present: small and medium-sized enterprises. The importance of SMEs in the European Union is clear if we bear in mind that they generate 84% of jobs. In my country, Spain, that figure is even higher. This means we have to focus our efforts on the flexibility of the job market, the removal of cumbersome processes that slow down company creation, and to provide incentives for the self-employed and SMEs. Job flexibility and security will be key for understanding future legislation, job mobility and the productive collaboration between training institutions and companies. Veronica Lope Fontagné,

Madam President, first of all I would like to draw attention to the significant contribution that cohesion policy has made to economic growth and to the integration of the citizens and territories of the EU. For this reason, it was essential that Parliament should have its say on the policy to be followed from 2013 and it would be unfair to fail to mention the work carried out by Mr Pieper in his extensive report. Within cohesion policy the European Social Fund has been and will be a very important tool to assist Member States to adapt their policies to the Europe 2020 strategy and to combat the financial crisis. The Fund must concentrate its efforts on creating employment, promoting lifelong learning, helping in particular low-skilled workers, those outside the labour market, along with the most vulnerable groups, those who suffer discrimination and, of course, SMEs. It should also aim to achieve social inclusion and reduce poverty. In order to achieve these objectives it is imperative for the Social Fund, as part of the Structural Funds, to count on adequate resources and that administrative and procedural burdens are relaxed as much as possible and reduced to a minimum.

There are various reasons for supporting coal aid: strategic reasons, regional sustainability reasons and social reasons. With regard to the strategic reasons, we need to take into account the fact that the market is changing rapidly. Therefore, abandoning coal without having a viable alternative would not be appropriate. The environmental argument is not relevant either, as imported coal is equally as polluting as indigenous coal. Moreover, we should not forget that, on many occasions, the mines from which we import coal do not comply with social rights. With regard to regional sustainability, in many cases, the mines are in sparsely populated areas that are entirely dependent on the industry to maintain the region, and we risk turning our lands into deserts. The final and most important reason is the more than 180 000 families that could be affected. In Spain, in my region of Aragon, we are pioneers of renewable energy sources, with almost 60% energy independence. The only resource that we can store is coal, and we need more time in order to improve our technologies and apply them to mining, thus transforming our indigenous coal into clean, sustainable coal.

Madam President, Europe needs a strategy that will enable it to emerge stronger from the economic and financial crisis and tackle the long-term challenges that it has to face, such as, for example, the ageing population. In the strategy for the next decade, the Europe 2020 strategy, employment policy has to play a very important role. Its objectives must be sustainable growth, job creation and seeking greater social cohesion, and combating poverty is a new priority for the Union to which my group is committed. The strategy demonstrates the need to undertake structural reforms in order to improve the way that labour markets operate, while also improving competitiveness and productivity. We would not be consistent if we only thought about job creation in the future and allowed existing jobs to be destroyed, as is occurring in some sectors such as the coal sector at the moment, where a large number of jobs could be lost across Europe. Mining needs to be maintained as a strategic reserve and to complement renewable energy sources. If you will allow me, I will talk about my country, Spain, and my region, Aragon. For one of the provinces, Teruel – where the population density is around 12 inhabitants per square metre – the loss of around 5 000 jobs would mean the desertification of a whole area of land. We therefore need to focus, on the one hand, on consolidating and maintaining the jobs that we have at the moment and, on the other, on undertaking the reforms set out in this report. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Madam President, we believe it to be essential to include the self-employed in this directive, and this view is shared by the representatives of both unions and employers’ associations in my country, who have expressly requested the inclusion of the self-employed in this directive. We believe that there are several reasons for their inclusion. Firstly, because of workers’ safety: self-employed hauliers deserve the same protection as other hauliers, not just when they are driving, but also when they are undertaking other tasks that are directly related to a road transport operation. Secondly, for reasons of fair competition, as bringing back discrimination between self-employed and employed workers will distort both the labour market and the transport market. Finally, it also seems inappropriate to me that each Member State should be able to apply the provisions of the directive to drivers if it so wishes. There needs to be a general rule for the entire EU, since the majority of hauliers work outside their own countries; without it, fair competition would be impeded. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, the future 2020 strategy must enable the European Union to correct the shortcomings detected in the Lisbon Strategy if we really want to create a competitive economic space, and one that is economically, socially and territorially cohesive. In spite of the fact that the postulates of the by now outdated Lisbon Strategy are still valid, I would like to point out that one of the reasons why it lost force was because of its highly complex structure, particularly its lack of clarity in defining the responsibilities and tasks incumbent upon the European Union and other levels of government, particularly those of a regional and local nature. Regions and local authorities must be included in the design and implementation of policies if we want the 2020 strategy to bear any fruit in the medium term. Our regions and cities are key agents in the development and implementation of a great deal of EU public investment related to growth and employment. The allocation of regional policy resources thus becomes a key factor in terms of meeting the European objectives that we are defining. I would like to point out that the resources invested from 2000 to 2006 by way of the European Regional Development Fund have enabled the creation of 1 400 000 jobs in the European Union, as well as the building of over 2 000 km of motorways. I would like to finish by pointing out once more the value of the European regional policy with respect to strategic goals such as growth and employment. Economic, social and territorial cohesion represents a basic objective guaranteed by the treaties. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately we are having to deal with this sad and now customary matter once again. I would like to express my respect and gratitude to all the professionals and volunteers who have contributed to the rescue and reconstruction effort in the affected areas, and I would like to express my particular condolences to the families of the victims. We need to provide help to the victims and pave the way so that the affected areas can recover quickly. We also need to continue working intensively in the area of prevention. Finally, and most importantly, I would call on the Spanish Government to use its current Presidency of the European Union to provide the impetus needed to modify the current European Union Solidarity Fund Regulation – a request already made on a number of occasions by the European Parliament – in order to achieve faster, more flexible and more efficient access to it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wish to express my solidarity with the families of all those affected by the dreadful news of the closure of the Antwerp plant. We are thinking not only of all those who will be directly affected and lose their jobs, but also of all the subcontracting companies that will suffer as a result. We must keep them in mind too. The Figueruelas plant is in my region, Aragón, so this matter affects us directly.

Mr President, I would like to talk about the aid approved under the Temporary Framework aimed at reducing the problems that have arisen as a result of the economic crisis, and specifically about Opel. I would like to ask you whether the Commission is examining whether the aid received by Germany under the Temporary Framework was dependent on a prior agreement regarding the geographical distribution of the restructuring measures, which would not be in line with the purpose of this aid. If this is the case, I would like to know whether you agree with the company having the freedom to revise the distribution and restructuring of Opel according to its own economic and production criteria and maintaining the greatest possible number of jobs.

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, when it was proposed that we have a debate in plenary on the future of Opel Europe, we were not yet aware of the purchase of the company by Magna and its Russian partner, Sberbank, on Thursday. After months of uncertainty, a new phase is beginning for Opel Europe which, for some, is grounds for hope, while for others, grounds for concern. We want the conditions of the final contract, which will be signed in the next few months, to be positive for the future of the company, and I hope that the German Government is right in thinking that this is the most reliable offer for the survival of the company. However, as a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and as someone from Aragon, where the Figueruelas factory, which is currently one of the most productive plants, is located, I must express my concern regarding the fate of the workers. There is talk that in its restructuring plan, Magna is considering making 10 560 workers redundant – currently 1 700 at the Aragon plant – to which many indirect redundancies will have to be added. We are aware that in order to save the company, there needs to be major restructuring, and that this will affect our workers, but we hope that the plan will be made using economic and productivity criteria, seeking to arrive at the best solution for everyone. We trust that, in the coming months, the governments of the affected countries will get involved along with Europe. This will mean that together, using economic criteria, we can support the viability of Opel with the lowest possible cost to the workers at all its European plants. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, in this first plenary sitting of the legislature, we have to deal with this sad and now customary issue: natural disasters and, in particular, fires. Once again we are lamenting the proliferation of fires during the summer of 2009, which have caused human losses. Twenty lives have been lost, all in my country. Therefore, my first thought and my utmost sympathy is for the human suffering caused by these catastrophes. I would like to stress the disastrous impact that this type of disaster has on the lives of the populations that are affected, on their economies, employment, natural and cultural heritage, the environment and tourism. In my region, 22 000 hectares burned this summer, half of which were in areas that are protected due to their environmental importance. We must respond to these problems without hesitation, the people are demanding it. The European institutions cannot be incapable once more of finding an adequate solution for those who are affected. We need to be able to help the victims and to pave the way for restoring the affected areas. We need to continue to work hard on prevention and to proceed further with developing the European civil protection service. I would like to make two calls: firstly, I would like to call on the European Commission to analyse the situation and adopt the appropriate measures to compensate for the social costs inherent in the loss of jobs and sources of income for the inhabitants of the affected regions. Secondly, I would like to call on the Spanish Government, which will hold the Presidency of the Council from January 2010. The Spanish Government must be capable of passing on its feeling and concern to its counterparts. I consider it essential that it makes it a priority in its programme to unblock the reform of the European Solidarity Fund. The Spanish Presidency must also make a clear commitment to developing a common European strategy. It must also review prevention measures and the forestry management models that encourage large fires.Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

Mr President, Commissioner, without ignoring the fact that data protection is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the current Directive was born of the desire to harmonise national provisions on data retention, in order to ensure the availability of those data for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, such as terrorism or organised crime.  This harmonisation is necessary because the inefficiency arising from the fragmentation created by national provisions has been demonstrated in studies and through practical experience. We therefore need to ensure the continued retention, at European level, of data that are generated or processed.  A recent example of how these data can be used in a judicial context as a tool to fight crime is the arrest in Spain on 4 October 2012 of a young man planning to imitate the Columbine massacre by planting bombs at universities in the Balearic Islands. Following a police investigation using data obtained from electronic communications, it was ascertained that the young man had bought various explosive substances and items of equipment needed to make homemade bombs. As a result, it was possible to prevent a real tragedy.  Nevertheless, I call on the Commission to present an urgent proposal for the revision of the legal framework for data retention, because the importance and sensitivity of this matter means that we cannot continue with a Directive that has technical shortcomings and intrudes, sometimes disproportionately, on the right to privacy.

 Maintaining international peace and security is one of the EU’s primary objectives. Currently, in our struggle to achieve democratic stability, we should not forget Latin America, which is facing important challenges, as already mentioned: democratic consolidation, regional integration, economic and social stability, poverty and, of course, security in the region. On the other hand, our Latin American neighbours share our values and principles, and they have a number of emerging countries such as Brazil and Mexico, which are key members of international forums such as the G20; finally, the region has great economic potential, with 10% growth forecast for the coming decade. In view of this, I believe that next autumn, the European External Action Service should focus strongly on the multi-party trade agreement between Peru, Colombia and the EU, the association agreement with Central America, and the negotiation of the development cooperation instrument. This is a key region for the EU, and we cannot gradually withdraw right when it is expanding the most. In conclusion, the EU is, and should become, even more aware and involved in conflict prevention and the struggle to maintain security. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the report we are debating today is a big step forward for all victims of crime and barbarity. Its progress lies in its due recognition of victims, and it gives more guarantees to the criminal procedure. Quite simply, victims will now have more legal certainty and society will be more sensitive to their suffering and pain. May I congratulate the two rapporteurs for their excellent work and tenacity, and I would particularly like to mention Ms Jiménez-Becerril, twice a victim of terrorism; through her committed campaigning and the complicity I so admire in Commissioner Reding, they have opened a door through which others will follow, so that judges, leaders and civil society can properly recognise the value, example and trauma of so many victims, providing them with guarantees, justice and respect. Today, Mr President, I would also like to send a message of solidarity to the people of the United States for the terrible tragedy that took place on that 11 September. I send them a testimony of my solidarity in a heartfelt prayer. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 I understand that many issues must be taken into account in the debate on the future of the common agricultural policy (CAP), in the context of the debate on the multiannual financial framework and on the transitory period for 2013, but they should not cause us to forget the urgent need to secure our farmers’ present and future. The economic crisis threatens the sector’s survival, so we need to guarantee the level of aid granted to farms, especially in the countries where we are suffering most from the crisis, such as Spain. The necessary financial discipline should not lead to a drastic adjustment of the CAP or a radical reduction in existing funds. I want to express my doubts regarding a possible single rate, even if it is greater than 50%, as it would mean the most vulnerable regions paying more, while ‘budgetary restrictions’ are being required of the country. This is a complicated debate but, now more than ever, we must increase our efforts to strengthen the CAP as part of the backbone of the EU, not forgetting decisive support for those regions and countries being hit particularly hard by the economic crisis.

 Mr President, this afternoon’s debate is neither new, nor is the issue limited to Romania, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria; it affects all Member States. These are the three affected countries today, but this could happen to any other on other occasions. This House, in fact, in its Declaration of 8 March 2011, has already asked the Commission to establish a new mechanism that will guarantee complete reciprocity for all Member States, ensuring that if a third country fails to reciprocate the visa regime, all Member States would enforce obligatory visa requirements for the citizens of that country. The principles of reciprocity and solidarity should guide the Union’s policy on visas, whilst also respecting, as is the case here, other debates on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the European Union and Canada. Only this way will we achieve a visa policy that is robust, rigorous, credible, supportive and unified. In the same manner, I am also aware of the importance of the Union’s foreign relationships, as well as those of the individual Member States; and for that reason, there is a need to find the balance between respect for the principles of reciprocity and solidarity and European trade relationships. This issue, as you are aware, has been debated for almost a year within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, via a proposal for the modification of Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. This would lead to the establishment of a list of the third countries whose citizens require visas to cross borders and a list of third countries whose citizens are exempt from this requirement. I am the rapporteur for this legislative initiative. The exact objective of this proposal is to provide the Union with an effective and realistic mechanism to resolve conflicts such as those currently being experienced by Romanian, Czech and Bulgarian citizens with Canada. We began the trialogue negotiation stage with the Council a week ago, but I have a strong mandate when it comes to reciprocity. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) is committed and calls for reciprocity. The stances of the three institutions and the Parliament are currently being aligned, but we are all aware of the urgency and the need to reach an agreement that satisfies the interests of all those concerned. Commissioner, I do not believe we can reach this agreement under the Danish Presidency. You are already aware that Parliament only says ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to an international agreement. I will say ‘no’ and will recommend that my political group says ‘no’ if Canada does not absolve the Czechs, Bulgarians and Romanians from the obligation, prior to the vote. Mr President, Mr Enciu makes a very solid and impeccable argument. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the European economic crisis is not strong enough to dissuade illegal immigrants who risk their lives at sea. Why is this? It is because the difficult situation that they find themselves in here does not compare to the conditions there. Besides that, there is the question of asylum, which transcends and has nothing to do with purely economic situations or situations of another nature. Asylum must always be equal to protection. I welcome Mr Iacolino’s initiative as it is very appropriate and I agree that it should be extended and reproduced every year, but in December. The phenomenon of heading out to sea in spring is not a new one – it is predictable – and, although it cannot be avoided, it can be alleviated. The Member States can control neither the Mediterranean nor the Atlantic front on their own. We need a timetable of solidarity, intelligence and diplomacy to do just three things: firstly, to try to stop them leaving at source; secondly, to patrol, save and help those who have managed to get out; and thirdly, to welcome those who have managed to arrive in decent and humanitarian conditions. There needs to be coordinated action between the Commission, the Member States, Frontex and third countries. These are not easy tasks – I am well aware of that – but we must not hold an untimely debate each year that has limited effectiveness. May I remind you that this discussion began in the parliamentary delegation sent to Sicily and Lampedusa almost six months ago. Then there is the question of the immigrant internment centres and the administrative detention centres, which must, without a shadow of a doubt, improve their reception and residence conditions, and the question of a legal, safe return and resettlement subject to scrupulous respect for human rights. As you can see, what I am telling you is not an issue that affects a particular country: it affects the whole of the EU and we must all make a commitment to providing an adequate response to this humanitarian challenge. We are late in saying this, but it is better to say it than not, and it is appropriate to do so on 9 May. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the interinstitutional balance is a reference that is bound by the Treaties and declared a fundamental political issue, both by Parliament and by the Commission and the Council. Mr President, I would like to denounce, as a repeated attitude, the lack of sensitivity on the part of any Commissioner of the European Commission who does not have availability in their schedule to respond to requests for interviews or meetings with MEPs. I will not mention names or specific cases today, but I think that Mr Barroso – who has always set an example of cooperation with Parliament and its MEPs – should send out an unequivocal signal to the College of Commissioners that meetings at the request of MEPs should be a priority and take place frequently. The reasons to protect cooperation and the much talked-about interinstitutional balance are unquestionable, not to mention the due respect that this House deserves.

Madam President, here is my opinion on the matter. As a response to the threats that the EU and the US must face, the Passenger Name Records (PNR) Agreement must be interpreted within the framework of the fight against transnational crime in all its dimensions. The strategy on the external dimension of Justice and Home Affairs, the EU strategy against terrorism and the Stockholm Programme all refer to the need to establish close cooperation with third countries through exchange of information. The data that are gathered under the PNR Agreement are used for purposes of preventing, detecting, suppressing and pursuing and for those purposes only. This new agreement provides great improvements by comparison with the 2007 agreement. The PUSH method is recognised as the mode of transfer, there is greater protection for data gathered, the number of supervisory authorities is increased and there are advances in data evaluation, not to mention the right of citizens to request correction or deletion of their PNR data, with the possibility of administrative or judicial redress. Moreover, the agreement respects the right to privacy in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Limitations may only be introduced where they are necessary and where they genuinely meet the general interest objectives recognised by the EU or protect the rights and freedoms of others. In these circumstances, we have two options: vote in favour of the agreement, and benefit from the improvements that have been introduced, or vote against. In the latter case, we would create great legal uncertainty that could lead to the signing of bilateral agreements, and to penalties and obligations being placed on airlines. We must commit and ensure a high level of effective protection of personal data, which means that any transfer of PNR data to the US must be done in a secure manner and in accordance with EU law and that passengers can exercise their rights in relation to the use of their data. In light of this situation then, Madam President, I am in favour of this agreement to combat terrorism and transnational crime.

The fact is, you use the language of Goethe and I use the language of Cervantes, and we have interpreters but, in spite of this, we cannot communicate with one another. Why?

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Coelho, thank you. We must highlight the advances represented by the use of biometric passports but we cannot deny the problems that exist in terms of implementation, especially the weaknesses detected in the passport-issuance chain. It would serve no purpose to equip border controls with great technical instruments if the system has a significant weakness in terms of procedures. In this context, if we take it into account, the balance between combating crime in the EU, respecting individual rights and guaranteeing free movement in the Schengen area takes on even greater importance. The forging of documents, organised crime and terrorism constitute direct attacks on our citizens but also on their personal rights and so we must reinforce the whole process of gathering and handling information of a personal nature. We must afford greater security to the travel document, establishing a reliable link between the passport and its holder. Accordingly, repeated fraudulent practice provides ample justification for the evaluation reports. Commissioner Malmström, we await the intermediate report scheduled for June, and the report scheduled for mid-2013, with great interest. We continue to back training for those responsible for managing the system, along with improvements to and interoperability of equipment and documents issued at each of the stages, without compromising, of course, either the information or the rights of the holder of the passport. Commissioner, being in a position to determine the scope of the issue of fingerprinting children, which, as has already been stated, is currently under study, is very important. Therefore, I place great value on the Portuguese Government’s decision to give reliability to the procedure. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, I echo the need to reach an overall agreement for the future that ensures the survival of the most deprived persons in the Union. We are talking about vulnerable, excluded, and poor people. The figures state that 13 million people in 19 Member States are experiencing poverty, 30 million people are undernourished, and 43 million people are at risk of experiencing food poverty, which shows the need to work together in order to ensure the programme continues after 2013. We must make use of the debate on the multiannual financial framework, as well as the debate on CAP reform, in order to ensure food aid and to overcome the legal obstacles. The Member States are going through a difficult period, but that is exactly why we now have to make greater efforts to protect those who are suffering the most due to the crisis: children, the sick, the unemployed, the elderly, and those 80 million people who are currently living below the poverty line in general. The Commission’s right to initiative is vital and essential. There are no disagreements in that respect in this Parliament, Mr President. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, I was and I am a supporter of Kosovo. During the Milosevic era I was in the refugee camps in Kukes, Elbasan, Stankovic, and so on. I welcomed many members of the Kosovo Liberation Army to my own city and offered them my solidarity. However, Mr President, Kosovo today has problems of corruption, control of the media, organised crime, and of government with room for improvement. In my opinion, Mr President, Kosovo does not today meet any of the necessary conditions either for being in the European Union or for being an independent country.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to heartily congratulate Mr Rui Tavares. This debate is a step towards the Union undertaking more humanitarian work, and providing greater international protection for refugees. We commend the improvement in reception conditions, the use of asylum procedures and the promotion of good and effective practices to ensure that people’s rights are protected in the international domain. Taking into account the fact that there were 301 000 asylum applications last year, of which 59 465 were accepted, we must streamline resettlement measures in the interest of maximising the efficiency of the services supplied. Five thousand resettlements in Europe is still very small in solidarity terms. I also went to Shusha. Far more Member States are going to have to involve themselves in resettlement, and therefore, we support the provision of additional financial support for those making the effort for the first time. There is also the need to provide additional financial support for the resettlement of people from specific geographical regions and nationalities once this has been decided as the most appropriate way of responding to their specific needs. The urgency and priority of Member State support should not be forgotten when it comes to children and women from specific risk groups, the victims of psychological, physical and sexual violence, as well as the victims of exploitation. One in every five asylum seekers is under the age of thirteen. Congratulations, Mr President, for this interinstitutional agreement. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Mr President, I understand that regulation when it comes to data protection can be based on internal security strategies. We cannot forget, however, that its extra-territorial impact could infringe on the rights of European citizens. What has arisen in connection with the Medicare Act, FISA, the Patriot Act and FATCA cases is more than mere concern. It appears that many of these measures stipulate that European financial entities, in the widest sense of the term, are obliged to provide all types of information, whether it concerns the title holder, their account types or the withholding of payments, among others. There is no prior agreement to justify obtaining this data, nor do the users know what the data will be used for or the amount of time for which it will be stored. It is therefore necessary to adopt measures and design a body of regulations and legislation to avoid infringement of the principle of territoriality. We should be able to maintain our relationships outside the Union, as well as our territory’s security, whilst totally respecting the rights of European citizens. The European Commission should show much more commitment and interest in this task. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I reiterate: the food programme must be extended indefinitely. Our credibility is linked to the solidarity we show, and more so in a crisis period. Nobody can reasonably deny this, nor will they be able to. We know the disappointing and bitter figures. What poor person cares about the legal basis, or the ruling, or the common agricultural policy or the social dimension? Are we going to explain it to them? I do not want to and I cannot. We do not provide any justification for not giving, ladies and gentlemen, but we want to justify the fact that now we are taking away what we once gave them, and this is truly inexplicable. I ask for justice and I ask for compassion. We cannot reduce the EUR 500 million, because it is needed. For poor people, the situation is not a crisis. It is critical, and it affects the most vulnerable of them: old people, children, the sick, the homeless, those without power, without medicines and without food. React, ladies and gentlemen of the Council, react. I do not see any poor person sitting in the Council, Mr President. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, let me say it again: the food programme must be extended until 2020. The programme provides food aid to 13 million poor people in 19 Member States. Thirty million people in the Union suffer from malnutrition, 43 million are at risk of suffering from food poverty and 80 million live below the poverty threshold. What we are asking for – what I am asking for – is not charity. It is compassion and it is justice. We must maintain the level of financing at EUR 500 million. The poor are those who are suffering most from the crisis and much more so in winter: without a roof over their heads, in extreme cold, without power and without food. This affects the most vulnerable: children, old people and the sick. Solidarity within the Union cannot now be a dialectical resource, because that would make it a contemptible resource.

 Mr President, our energy dependence is a well-known fact. We import 60% of our gas and 83% of our oil. As for coal, our dependence amounts to 41%. Coal is the Union’s principal electricity-producing fuel, on a par with nuclear energy and gas. If we limit our mining capacity, we will simply have to import it from countries that do not have our social or environmental standards. In its energy strategy for 2050, the Commission should review the current framework of aid provision to coal mining. There is scope for improvement of the new legislation as regards the time limit for mine closure or the requirement to return the aid received in order to continue in operation. Our energy dependency is one more of our external weaknesses and, in the current crisis, we will pay the price for it sooner rather than later. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, it is regrettable that the European Union should abandon thousands of refugees to their fate on account of a mere institutional disagreement, and I am pointing my finger at the Council. The debate on the legislative procedure to choose priority regions has gone to absurd extremes, breaking the principle of solidarity which inspires the Union and the European Refugee Fund. The issue is not whether we should use a procedure based partially on codecision, as proposed by the Council, or the ordinary legislative procedure proposed by this House. The really important matter is to help those who most need it and to ensure the priority regions are chosen promptly so that the ultimate aim of helping persecuted and deprived people can be achieved. If this choice is considered a delegated act, then let us accept the comitology procedure; if not, let us agree once and for all on the mechanism through which the choice is to be made. I have visited many refugee camps, the last one of them in July …  (The President cut off the speaker) Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Madam President, I fully support the proposal for a directive; it is a real breakthrough. Furthermore, Ms Angelilli’s commitment to the cause of child protection is one of the most noble objectives that a parliamentarian can undertake. Children are weak and vulnerable and therefore deserve the highest level of protection. Sexual abuse of children must be prevented with new legislative measures and punished harshly under criminal law. So-called sex tourism and child pornography are forms of exploitation which should be a matter of priority for law enforcement, including international agreements on the matter. In my opinion, all agreements with third countries on free trade and development aid must include a child protection clause. We must also focus our serious concerns on the child indoctrination that occurs in some countries suffering structural poverty, where they hand over many children, the offspring of polygamous unions, to apparently religious schools to avoid lack of food and hunger. Child assassins, child soldiers and child drug runners are among the most heinous forms of exploitation, a widespread phenomenon on two continents which has irreversible social repercussions. Programmes to rescue child victims of forced prostitution must be a political and social priority of the European Union. Line 11600 must have the commitment and unwavering support of all Member States. Madam President, I appreciate and applaud the effort and commitment of the Council, but I particularly applaud the commitment of Ms Malmström and Ms Angelilli.

 Mr President, I congratulate Ms Lambert and the shadow rapporteurs on the impetus given to this report, without which there would have been no agreement with the Council. How to go about deciding who qualifies as a family member was a key factor for my group. This needs to be defined properly to prevent abuse of the Community system for international protection. The distinction between beneficiaries of asylum and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection is essential when agreeing on who has what rights. Subsidiary protection is more limited in time than asylum, the former status providing entitlement to a shorter residence permit (one year) and the latter to a longer residence permit (three years), although both cases can be reviewed if the threat to the beneficiaries remains. The plan to remove the distinction between the two forms of protection was originally rejected by my group and by the Council, which is why we must now congratulate ourselves on the agreement reached with the rapporteur. The need to recognise the rights that legitimately belong to those that are persecuted is consistent with measures to prevent fraudulent use of the European system for international protection. We must also welcome the fact that the report sets out the need for Member States and their authorities to safeguard the best interests of minors and to extend protection to unaccompanied minors, paying particular attention to their safety, well-being and development, as well as the principle of family unity. Lastly, Mr President, the inclusion of references to persecution by customs or traditions, resulting in genital mutilation, forced abortion or forced sterilisation is a remarkable and outstanding achievement.

Mr President, this is a debate that has already taken place, but I shall make some comments with reference to new scenarios. Following the failed attack on a plane on 25 December 2009, more effective protection and detection technology had to be sought. Scanners at airports increase levels of security but they present problems, especially in relation to the protection of human rights. The Council and the Commission accepted Mr de Grandes Pascual’s proposal that security scanners should not use technology based on ionising radiation. Now it must be decided whether the exploration mechanism will use real passenger images or stick images, which are the most appropriate option in order to protect the intimacy, privacy, health and dignity of passengers. However, stick figures present a problem in terms of free competition since today, only one company has that technology. Although other companies in the sector have announced that they can introduce the algorithms needed in order to adapt the scanners, the machine configuration time could work against them. Therefore, the Commission should examine the timeframe for implementing the rules relating to body scanners, avoiding a possible monopoly situation and supporting decisively Parliament’s report and the report of Mr de Grandes Pascual, which are one and the same thing. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, Ms Meissner, thank you very much for your interesting question. Strictly speaking, in order to avoid what you are unhappy about and what I, too, am unhappy about, I would say and repeat that what the Commission should do is examine the timeframe for the implementation of rules relating to body scanners very carefully. That way, everyone will be able to compete on equal terms but in line with what has been said by Parliament and in Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, let us indeed talk about solidarity and the poor. In the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting, a blocking minority opposed the amendment to the regulation governing food aid to the most disadvantaged. Mr Sawicki has already explained their reasons. However, the Council should be reminded that 60% of the funds is needed to feed the 79 million people in Europe who live below the poverty line. Those funds are provided by national, regional and local governments, and by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Up until last April, the European Union contributed 40%. The position taken by the blocking minority would lead to a drastic reduction in aid for next year, and a complete abolition by 2013. We condemn this. I would like to thank the Polish Presidency and the Commission for their determination to continue the programme, and I emphatically condemn the position of those Member States that formed a blocking minority. I ask those Member States: where is your compassion? Have you even heard of compassion? I urge Mr Cioloş and Mr Sawicki not to give up, because no court can go against the law of God, or against compassion. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Madam President, Commissioner, on my initiative, between 13 July 2011 and 16 July 2011 a delegation from the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs went to Tunisia, specifically to the refugee camps on its border with Libya and the camp at Sousse. There are 4 500 people from Darfur, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire, Palestine and Iraq living in inhumane conditions and suffering an extreme temperature of 50 degrees centigrade. There is sickness and violence; the camp has burned down three times; and there is a lack of hygiene and drinking water. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Médecins Sans Frontières
 and other organisations are doing a tremendous job. Tunisia has shown solidarity with displaced persons and refugees from Libya. Tunisians have welcomed 90 000 Libyans into their own homes. However, beyond this emergency nobody is taking care of those in Sousse. There is a major difference between the Europe that donates and the Europe that does not receive. Our solidarity extends to other countries, but we do not show solidarity within our borders. We now need to make an impassioned plea for resettlement, so that the 4 000 refugees can be received on European soil. This is neither complicated nor expensive. There has been a show of commitment, as the Commissioner said, but there needs to be something more than good will and statements of intent. We urgently need to resettle those groups who are suffering so much hardship in Sousse and who, in Europe, could find hope for their shattered lives. Many times and in desperate voices they asked Europe not to abandon them. Others told us their child had lost 10 kilos and was malnourished and in need of medical attention, but they had nowhere to go. Resettlement offers have so far totalled – or would total, if they were carried out – 718, but that still leaves 3 707 people. Madam President, I strongly call on the Council and the Commission to show commitment in order to end this serious humanitarian crisis as soon as possible. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the European Union is Taiwan’s fifth largest trading partner, whereas for the Union, this Asian island ranks fourteenth among its trading partners. Trade between the two parties has increased by 800% in the last decades, with the annual trade volume currently standing at EUR 27.5 billion. Last year alone, trade between the Union and Taiwan grew by 39%. This growth has been boosted by measures such as visa exemption, introduced via the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. In spite of this and the fact that the Europe 2020 strategy stresses that the Union needs to step up its trade links with growing and emerging markets, our relations with Taiwan have not reached their full development as far as trade is concerned. It is therefore necessary to bring in new measures to remove the obstacles – including tariffs, trade prohibitions, taxes and duties on luxury products – which currently prevent us from unlocking the full potential of trade with Taiwan. This would be a decisive step towards a dynamic, ambitious free trade agreement, which I support. A free trade agreement is necessary and it will benefit the parties involved. Good trade dialogue is not enough, Commissioner. We need to go much further. Furthermore, no one has the right to veto our relations. The ties between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China are getting stronger every day, and we, the European Union, have sovereignty to decide, without anyone’s interference, who we negotiate our free trade agreements with.

 Madam President, on 29 June 2011 a group of Taliban terrorists murdered Antonio Planas in Kabul, a Spanish national like myself, aged 49, married and the father of a young girl. Until a few days ago, certain Spanish nationals who were victims of terrorist attacks outside of the European Union territory could not have access to protection and compensation mechanisms. On 23 June 2011, however, the legislation was amended to benefit terrorist victims and their relatives, irrespective of the country where the attack took place. The threat is not limited to a given territory and it must be prevented at national, EU and international level, strengthening cooperation with third countries. The defence of terrorist victims and their rights should be a priority policy in the Union, and the institutions should encourage their public recognition. Thus, we welcome the actions proposed by the Commission, although more concrete instruments to help the victims of terror are still needed. The family of Antonio Planas needs our help, and we urge the institutions concerned to provide it. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, corruption costs the European Union the same amount as its annual budget. Four out of every five citizens consider corruption to be one of the biggest problems for Member States. On 6 June 2011, the Commission published the package of measures aimed at fighting corruption. That is commendable. These measures include the introduction of updated EU rules on public procurement, rules on auditing and regulatory monitoring of EU companies, development of a biannual report that identifies corruption trends, measures relating to the confiscation of criminal assets, a strategy to improve research on financial crime, and the action plan for improving statistics on corruption offences. These proposals are warmly welcomed. Nevertheless, we need to show caution with regard to Member States’ individual compliance with implementation, especially when we consider the data provided by the report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to which 12 out of the 27 EU Member States have no anti-corruption rules or have minimal, insufficient standards. That is why we have doubts about the Commission’s real capacity – despite its best intentions – to implement the measures it has proposed; it therefore needs to go further, guaranteeing that all the Member States make a real commitment to combating corruption, for this is of great necessity, above and beyond expert groups, political will or generalities. We call for specific, legally-binding actions. That is what we are asking for. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Madam President, I offer my sincere congratulations to Mr Busuttil, to the Commission and to the Council. The creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is one of the Union’s greatest achievements, enabling almost 500 million people to move freely within its territory. The removal of internal borders meant that the peripheral countries were obliged to strengthen their border controls, a function which, as you will recall, falls within the exclusive competence of the countries concerned. The land-locked countries benefit from the free area, but occasionally they forget that this situation is largely due to the effort made by Member States with external boundaries, an effort which is bound to increase in situations where there is a migration crisis. To an ever-increasing extent, these situations require the intervention of Frontex. However, the agency’s ability to react is limited as it lacks the necessary resources. This lack of resources is due in large part to the lack of real commitment on the part of certain Member States. Thus, it was necessary and appropriate to strengthen the Frontex Regulation, clearly defining the agency’s role and providing the legal instruments enabling it to be equipped with the necessary means and resources needed to carry out its goals in full accordance with fundamental rights. The provision of economic, material and human resources cannot depend on the good will of only some Member States, since solidarity should be binding and general. Frontex should also coordinate its activities with Europol and Eurojust to fight organised crime. Cooperation with the European Asylum Support Office is an essential element in ensuring access to international protection. The creation of a system of border guards is an interesting proposal which may be brought about if it is implemented through the compulsory solidarity clause. In short, approval of the proposed regulation will make it possible to manage migratory flows better, fight the mafias more effectively and improve the common asylum system.

 Mr President, I reject this report as inappropriate, mistaken, misinformed, untimely and subjective. The fight against terrorism is very necessary and it must be efficient, act as a deterrent and have a preventative effect too. Although it must be valued, its costs should never be evaluated in economic terms. How many euros does a life cost? How many euros do three thousand lives cost? I support democratic judges and police officers and I trust in them and I believe in our democratic vitality to correct the abuses of power that could occur. I would also cite psalm 46 in solidarity: ‘Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea’. I share the reflected absence too; it is present in my heart and in my speeches as are all the victims: those of Madrid, London, Marrakech, Casablanca and Bali, all of them. No, Mr President, this own-initiative report is a bad initiative. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Madam President, the reality: 30 million people are malnourished and 79 million people live in poverty; the tragedy: a court decision; the shame: that we allow this. The European Parliament must make its unanimous and powerful voice heard. This is an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to the weakest people. We must make a distinction between selfish rhetoric and real solidarity. We, Madam President, must create the momentum so that the Council allows us to do away with the blocking minority. We are wholeheartedly calling for the solidarity – agreed to yesterday in this House – of the President-in-Office of the Council, of the Polish Presidency. Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament cannot forsake millions of people, the poorest of the poor, who suffer the most acute effects of the crisis. We are talking about a budget going from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million, which is a decrease of 63%. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, within an hour, Parliament must clearly declare that, regardless of the outcome of the court decision, the essence of the EU, which is solidarity, is present here, in this House, the house of the people and of the European peoples.

Mr President, Schengen is a milestone in the construction of the area of liberty, security and justice. Freedom of movement is, moreover, a fundamental pillar of the EU, enshrined in Article 45 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights and it must be preserved and protected. We need more Europe, not less Europe. Limiting the Schengen agreement is not the solution. What we must do is overcome, once and for all, the reluctance of some Member States to make advances in the sphere of immigration. The EU has the means to do it but the political will is lacking. We can and must reinforce external border control mechanisms, improve and equip the capabilities and means of Frontex, promote the creation and implementation of Eurosur, drive the implementation of the second generation Schengen Information System and the Visa Information System, foster cooperation and the exchange of information between border, police, judicial and customs services, and advance determinedly towards the construction of a common policy on matters of immigration, asylum and visas that gives special consideration to cooperation agreements with third countries. The performance of the Member States in the sphere of immigration should be inspired by Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, helping in solidarity those who, by virtue of their geographic position, are obliged to deal with extraordinary flows of irregular immigrants or those seeking international protection. The responsibility must be shared in this regard, Mr President. I am bound to note that the reintroduction of border controls and internal controls for circumstances not provided for in Articles 23, 24 and 25 of the Schengen Borders Code is illegal and seriously violates the provisions of Article 77 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The mechanism for evaluation by a Community court, proposed by the Commission, should be the only instrument and should be extraordinary and temporary. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very rigorous work. The objective of this report is to maintain a high level of security in airports while safeguarding citizens’ fundamental rights. Air transport is a target for terrorist attacks, and it is therefore necessary to strengthen security in order to protect people, infrastructure, cargo and mail. In that respect, security scanners in airports are a useful tool. Their inclusion among screening methods used to detect banned or dangerous items is therefore necessary. However, it is vital for a thorough evaluation to be carried out in advance, in order to determine the least harmful technology and the level of non-cumulative emissions that is acceptable for public health. It is also important that, with this technology, the protection of personal data is guaranteed and the dignity of the individual being screened is preserved. I would like to point out that Member States can implement stricter security measures than those required by European legislation, thus having the capacity to introduce scanners in airports under their jurisdiction. The EU institutions therefore need to lay down common rules of procedure with regard to detection performance criteria and tools. Information relating to the screening procedure is a vital element of this tool. Airport personnel must receive proper training in order to provide passengers with adequate information on screening safety, voluntary participation, alternatives and the deletion of images. To conclude, I would like to emphasise that any passenger’s decision to refuse screening does not make them a suspect, and that the selection criteria for being scanned will be based exclusively on security reasons and not on any other grounds, such as race or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religion, and so on. Having nothing further to add, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Madam President, I support Mr Coelho’s thorough work and I congratulate him on his negotiating capacity, in Parliament and at first reading. In terms of the need to create a new agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems, we should remember that the Commission itself has declared that it cannot assume the responsibility for managing large databases, and that creating a merely executive agency would not in any case give Parliament control, because it would still be embedded in the structure of the European Commission. Considering the important work being entrusted to the new agency and the need for this work to be scrutinised by Parliament, however, the new body should take the form of a European agency with its own legal status. Its objectives should be clearly defined, these being operational management of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS) and Eurodac. It could also take responsibility for the preparation, development and operational management of other large-scale information systems. However, it should be noted that this must in all cases be done with the right legal instruments. The agency will not under any circumstances be able to take political decisions, such as creating new information systems or decisions on interoperability with different systems. The important role that the agency is to play means it must have a reinforced administrative structure that will ensure data integrity and protection, and for this reason it is essential that it incorporate a post of data security manager and an independent data protection body, thereby complying with the legal provisions contained in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In conclusion, Mr Coelho, I am very much in agreement with your three initial points, and with the seven points made by Parliament on making a strong commitment to reaching an EU solution and taking a firm stand against any limitation of the Schengen Area.

 Mr President, 30 million people in the European Union suffer from malnutrition and a further 79 million live below the poverty threshold. Most of them depend on food aid provided primarily by food banks. Some 40% of the funds needed to provide this food come from contributions made by the Union, through the European Scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union. This scheme has been implemented to date in accordance with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 983/2008 establishing aid for the purchase of cereals, skimmed milk powder and rice. The Regulation was partially revoked in April by the General Court of the European Union, with the budget for food aid being reduced from EUR 500 million to EUR 133 million. The integration of the European Union has historically been based on the principle of solidarity. This is why, Mr President, we urge the new Polish Presidency and the European Parliament, now more than ever, to show their commitment to helping the most deprived, and to re-establishing the budget appropriation that is currently so limited.

Mr President, in my view, the arrest warrant is a fundamental tool in the fight against organised crime, terrorism and other forms of crime. It is a proven tool and, according to the Decision, the cornerstone of cooperation and the first concrete example of the principal of mutual recognition in the sphere of criminal law. Of course it is a very useful tool but we must not fail to mention that it also has weaknesses. The weaknesses are perfectly identified, as Commissioner Reding has also said, not only in the Commission’s report of April 2011, but also in its reports of 2005 and 2006. Those weaknesses, which stem fundamentally from two basic and essential premises, can and, naturally, must be corrected. The arrest warrant has two components: issue and refusal or surrender, as appropriate. The figures show that it is a useful tool, with 54 000 arrest warrants having been issued and 12 000 executed. Turning to the question of what corrections need to be made, what we need are greater and better procedural guarantees around issue, refusal and surrender. The issue of proportionality or the lack thereof in the use of the arrest warrant is critical, a key issue. For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to hear Commissioner Reding say that Member States will be required to exercise a proportionality test and to take care not to issue arrest warrants for minor offences. Incidentally, Mr President, during the course of these questions, one particular item has slipped in, namely, that every arrest warrant costs the Public Treasury EUR 25 000. This is something that was said by an Irish judge. I say to that judge that I do not believe it and that he should demonstrate on what basis such a calculation was made. Consequently, I believe that the arrest warrant should continue in force in revitalised form, with better procedural guarantees. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

No, Mr Dartmouth. I believe that the European Arrest Warrant is a more useful and more versatile tool for combating all the forms of crime to which we have referred. Commissioner Reding has already told you, and I emphasise the fact, that an extradition order can take up to a year whereas a European Arrest Warrant, on the other hand, must be substantiated within 40 days. That is why I believe that the latter is a much more versatile and much more useful procedure for fighting crime, wrongdoing and terrorism. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Coelho, and I do this because his work is consistently rigorous. I now add that we must help Bulgaria and Romania. I trust Bulgaria and Romania. They have worked well and hard and they should receive what is theirs by right – this is no gift. The Presidency-in-office of the Council and the Commissioner, Mrs Malmström, have both stated that these two countries comply with the technical and legal requirements, and I add my voice to theirs. I believe we should not consider any criteria other than the strictly technical and legal. These criteria essentially number five. They comply with the following: they comply with the data protection requirements, they comply with the Schengen Information System (SIS), they comply with police cooperation, they comply with the issue of visas and they comply with the control of external borders by air, sea and land. Strictly speaking, they also comply with the SIS and with the Supplementary Information Request at the National Entry (SIRENE). In view of all this, this House should send an unequivocally strong message to the Council and, notably, to the permanent representations of five countries that I shall refrain from mentioning but which are in the minds of all of us here today. I do believe, ladies and gentlemen, that in including Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area, which comprises more than four hundred million human beings, we are adding, not subtracting; we are building a stronger Europe. Furthermore, we should avoid double standards. Nor should we set conditions for Romania and Bulgaria that we do not ask of the other Member States in order to form part of this area of freedom. Thus, to end my speech, I fervently express my wish for a strong, majority-endorsed message to be sent from this House to the Council. Congratulations once again, Mr Coelho, and congratulations to Romania and Bulgaria. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to speak and to use this debate to talk about a fundamental issue: the emergency. They cannot cope alone. The root of this problem is, as everybody knows, in the unstable situations in Tunisia and Egypt, and the war in Libya. However, there is no limit to how long it will last: unfortunately, it will last a worrying length of time. We therefore need to decide how we can use our common policies to manage the emergency, because they cannot cope alone. In my opinion, Madam President, Commissioner, solidarity with the victims and solidarity with the host states and regions must be our priority. We have instruments that we are not using properly. We have four funds. Mrs Malmström told us clearly and briskly about sums that strike me as ridiculous. She spoke of EUR 30 million, EUR 25 million on request, etc. However, our four funds, the Refugee Fund, the Return Fund, the External Borders Fund and the Integration Fund, total almost EUR 3 billion within the scope of the financial perspectives. Mrs Malmström, it seems to me that these funds should be used for emergency situations, because we need to have the ability to use them and modify them. Our limitations in terms of collaboration and solidarity are symbolised by the fragility that the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union has demonstrated with the Hermes Operation. The arrival of increasing numbers of people fleeing the war and fleeing from desperation highlight how limited this capacity is. They cannot cope alone. Who can cope? The European Union has the necessary solidarity to meet the requirements of this emergency in real time. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I think nobody will be surprised to hear me say again that solidarity with refugees and displaced persons should constitute a fundamental element of EU policy in the areas of asylum and immigration. However, it is not just a question of having solidarity with those coming from weak and disadvantaged societies, but also with the Member States that, because of their geographic location, their culture or their language, suffer greater pressure in this regard. While numbers of applications for protection and of immigrants arriving are low in some countries, there are many other  countries that are unable to tackle on their own the pressure their borders are subjected to on a daily basis. Following Parliament’s adoption of the reports relating to the Commission communication on the Union resettlement programme and the modification of the European Refugee Fund in May 2010, we are still waiting for the Council to complete the codecision procedure. The pilot projects currently being undertaken in 10 Member States are a drop in an ocean, which we still have to cross. The southern Member States are subjected to great pressure, particularly since the popular movements in Egypt and Tunisia, and the war in Libya, began. Lampedusa, with a population of 5 000, has received almost 6 000 immigrants since the conflicts started. The aforementioned pilot projects are completely insufficient and will hardly do anything to relieve the pressure that is already affecting Italy and Malta, but will affect other Mediterranean countries in the near future. The Union as a whole must help these countries. It is imperative that the Council overcome the obstacles currently preventing the full implementation of a European resettlement programme and defeat the minorities blocking it. Massive population displacements and migrations affect the Union as a whole and not just a part of it. I am finishing, Mr President. Last week I called for a European Parliament presence on Libya’s borders and I repeat that call now. It is not enough for 10 fellow Members to have spent last week in Egypt: we must have the capacity to evaluate the humanitarian situation ourselves. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
).

 Mr President, there are thousands of refugees and thousands of displaced people. The solution to this emergency is evacuation. What is needed is transport. As Mr Guterres said, these people do not want to come to the European Union; they want to go back home. There are 2 million immigrants, 1 million Egyptians and 80 000 Bangladeshis. We must focus on the weakest of the weak: Eritreans, Somalis, the sub-Saharan Africans mistaken for mercenaries and Palestinians. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) says it needs USD 160 million over three months for water, medicines, food and transport. We expect a resounding response from the Union on Friday. Gaddafi cannot escape international criminal justice: mass attacks on his people constitute crimes against humanity. Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is already taking action. Mr President, the European Parliament must be involved. We are also a democratic instrument for applying pressure and informing the free world. We need a mandate from this Chamber for a delegation of Parliament in the UNHCR, Red Cross and Red Crescent refugee camps. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, in 2012, we urgently need a common asylum policy. The report presented by the Commission on 8 September highlights the numerous obstacles that the Member States encounter when seeking to achieve the objectives of Directive 2005/85/EC. Asylum seekers’ right to legal aid applies at different levels. Many Member States invoke the directive in providing legal assistance at the appeal stage, while others grant that right during both the application process and at second instance. Some Member States require proof of merit in order to decide whether or not free legal assistance is granted at the appeal stage. In the majority of cases, there are major differences regarding the deadlines for appealing, while the applicability of the automatic suspension of the effects of refusals also presents difficulties, as it only applies in six Member States. These differences demonstrate that the directive must be reviewed. In reviewing it, the Commission stresses the need to focus efforts on the initial phase of the procedure, in order to be more effective in differentiating which people have a right to protection. According to the Commission, this measure will help to save significant interpreting and legal assistance costs at second instance. However, the proposal is not accompanied by a detailed study of what the interpreting and legal assistance costs would be at first instance, nor of the costs that the Member States actually incur currently when applying the European legislation. For that reason, the Commission needs to provide information as to the actual costs relating to its proposal to focus efforts, and I do not think that the refusal that I have just heard from the Commission is acceptable. I sincerely believe that this is unacceptable and that it needs to be reconsidered or qualified. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, international adoption that is inspired by the principles of prevalence of the interests of the child and respect for his fundamental rights is an appropriate means of finding a family for children for whom a family cannot be found in their country of origin. People trafficking, sexual exploitation and work slavery are a terrible reality affecting hundreds of millions of minors. Let us look at some of the statistics: there are more than 145 million abandoned children in the world; in Russia alone, more than 600 000 live on the streets; since 1980, more than 2 million children have died in armed conflicts; more than 600 million children live in extreme poverty; more than 5 million die every year; more than 130 million children in developed countries grow up without access to a basic education due to their poverty, and 60% of them are girls; 7 million children worldwide are subject to sexual slavery. For all these reasons, we must foster mechanisms to promote an international adoption instrument inspired by protecting children, harmonising the different requirements and procedures laid down in the legislation of the Member States, in particular, applying Article 21 of the European Charter of Children’s Rights and taking into consideration Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

Madam President, Commissioner, trafficking in human beings is a harsh reality in the EU. Sexual exploitation is the main objective of the mafias that traffic human beings, followed by forced labour, domestic service, forced marriages, exploitation of children for begging, illegal adoption and the removal of organs, which are other scourges and aspects of the problem. The new powers that Article 63 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives Parliament must be used in order to strengthen EU legislation in this field. This includes, among many other issues, calling for the classification of crimes that are still not covered by some European criminal legislation. We need to strengthen our legislation to protect victims of trafficking from two perspectives: prevention and protection, and integration into society and the labour market. We need to establish specific measures to protect minors; to criminalise traffickers and middlemen; to establish measures to discourage demand and confiscate the proceeds of the crime; to establish the criminal responsibility of any legal persons that take part in any phase of trafficking; to step up employment inspection and penalties for the exploitation of employees and illegal hiring of irregular immigrants; to strengthen the role of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders and of the immigration liaison officers in detecting the channels used by traffickers and their modus operandi
; and finally, strengthening the role of the joint investigation teams of the European Police Office (Europol) in combating the mafias. I would like to conclude by adding that the figure of the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator could make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives that I have mentioned, although his powers and capacities must be clearly defined in order to prevent actions from being duplicated or interference with the functions entrusted to Europol.

Mr President, the increase in asylum applications on behalf of citizens of Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia requires measures protecting the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. Visas are an instrument included in the framework of immigration policies; their purpose is to legalise the entry and temporary stay in a country where the applicant is neither a non-national nor a resident. Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 provides for an evaluation mechanism for visa extension, in which certain requirements in relation to illegal immigration, public order and security, the Union’s external relations, territorial cohesion and the principle of reciprocity must be fulfilled. This mechanism could also function in the opposite direction. Asylum, on the other hand, is an instrument of protection that cannot be used incorrectly. It should be pointed out that the purpose of the European Union’s common policy in this area is to preserve the integrity of asylum as an instrument of protection for the persecuted, prioritising the principles of the Geneva Convention and the New York Protocol, applying common criteria for the identification of people who genuinely require international protection and a guaranteed common minimum level of benefits in all Member States for the welfare of those people. Asylum is therefore an instrument of humanitarianism and solidarity and, hence, exclusive in its purpose and nature. This is why it is important that the European Union reacts and helps the Serbian and Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonian authorities to adopt sufficient measures regarding the requirements that must be fulfilled to benefit from refugee status or subsidiary protection status, thereby avoiding improper or fraudulent use of them.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members, Mrs Guillaume, Mr Ilchev, Mrs Keller, Mrs Wikström and Mr Tavares. The support they have given me has improved this report. I would specifically like to draw the Council’s and the Commission’s attention to the terminology. From my point of view, it would be more appropriate if we used the term ‘irregular immigration’. Up to now, clandestine immigration has been referred to as ‘illegal immigration’ in all the legislative instruments the EU has enacted. Although it is true that in some Member States, an irregular entry or stay constitutes a crime and in others, the term ‘irregular’ has no legal or semantic significance, in many other Member States, an irregular entry or stay does not constitute an unlawful act, which is why we should not generally criminalise these activities. For this reason, in the explanatory statement of the report, it is asked that the institutions revise the terminology that is used, insisting on the need to find a more precise and appropriate definition for the phenomenon of clandestine immigration. Moving on to the substance of this issue, the immigration liaison officers’ network was created by Council Regulation (EC) No 377/2004. This instrument states that the liaison officers will be representatives of a Member State posted abroad by the immigration service or other appropriate authority with the aim of establishing and maintaining contact with the authorities of the host country, aiming to contribute to the prevention and combat of clandestine immigration, the repatriation of irregular immigrants and the management of legal immigration. Since the enactment of the regulation, the Frontex Agency has been established, whose mission is to coordinate operational cooperation between Member States in the area of external border management; assist the Member States in the training of national border guards; carry out risk analyses; monitor the development of external border control and surveillance research; assist Member States in circumstances that require increased technical and operational assistance at external borders and provide them with the necessary support in the organising of joint return operations. It is evident that the important mission entrusted to Frontex could be achieved in a more efficient way if they could draw upon the knowledge and experience of the immigration liaison officers’ network, especially if we take into account the fact that the European Agency does not have offices or representatives outside EU territory. The proposed amendment to Regulation (EC) No 337/2004 aims to harness the knowledge and experience of the immigration officials for Frontex and vice versa, which was not included in the original regulation. Furthermore, the proposed amendment suggests accessing the information obtained by the liaison officers’ network through ICONet, which is a secure information and coordination network for the immigration management services of Member States, accessing the External Borders Fund to promote the creation of liaison officers’ networks and, finally, facilitating a mechanism for the presentation of reports on the activity of the network and the designation of named regions of interest in the area of immigration. The relevant legal bases of the proposal are Article 63(3)(b) and Article 66 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. I will stop there, Madam President, and will make further observations in the second round. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your words, and also for your commitment. I would once again like to express my admiration for the way that you are managing the portfolio with which you have been entrusted. There have been 18 speeches this afternoon, and the majority groups have supported this report. I would therefore like to reiterate my deep and heartfelt gratitude, because they have participated actively, enriching and amending substantive issues that should be included and are now included. I am essentially referring to the human rights chapter, the European Asylum Support Office and the role of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Obviously, in such a broad and diverse Chamber, we are not obliged to agree with one another, which is why the efforts that we have all made to reach a very broad consensus are particularly significant. Ladies and gentlemen, from a centre-right and Christian Democrat position, I am indeed saying that I am unequivocally in favour of the expression ‘irregular’, and that I reject the expression ‘illegal’, as legally, semantically and ethically inappropriate. Thank you very much to all my fellow Members for their support, and also for their speeches, including the dissenting ones. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Madam President, in order to mitigate the social and energy impact and to ensure secure energy reserves, we have tabled three amendments in plenary with the following aims: firstly, for the overall volume of aid per year to diminish, but with no percentage limit or limit per business. In this respect, we are grateful for Mr Langen’s position regarding removing fixed references and each Member State being able to decide according to their interests. The second aim is for aid to cover exceptional costs to be extended to 2030. Such proposals will help to alleviate the energy dependency of numerous EU countries, including Spain. They would ensure the continuation of indigenous production and the preservation of thousands of jobs on which significant regions of Spain and of Europe as a whole are largely dependent.

Mr President, I would like to make an announcement to the House. The Taiwanese Government has informed the Council, via the permanent representations, Parliament and the Commission, that from today, 11 November, it is establishing visa exemptions for Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania. Consequently, all 27 EU countries can enter Taiwanese territory without a visa. When the House votes in a moment, Mr President, I will take the opportunity to congratulate all the political groups for the support that they have given to this matter, as well as the Taiwanese people, the Taiwanese authorities, and their extremely strong diplomatic team. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Madam President, freedom and security are essential elements for the implementation of any current democratic legal structure, in which freedom uses security as the most valued tool for protection. The transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to third countries is an essential element of the transnational fight against terrorism and organised crime. It should be based on scrupulous compliance with EU rules on the protection of personal data, as laid down in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. For this reason, we must welcome the communication from the Commission on the global approach to transfers of PNR data to third countries and its recommendations that the Council authorises the opening of negotiations in this area with Australia, Canada and the United States, as both instruments take up Parliament’s concerns regarding security, defending fundamental rights and protecting personal data. However, it should be pointed out that PNR data cannot be used for profiling, which is why the Commission sought to clarify – in my view, successfully – the differences between the expressions ‘risk assessment’ and the aforementioned profiling. Moreover, the Commissioner said that checking will be done by humans rather than being automated. Well, we will see what happens. Madam President, we need a single, general, legally binding agreement to protect personal data. This top-level agreement must be implemented through sectoral agreements in order to combat terror and organised crime. As regards the need, Madam President, it is obvious. As regards proportionality, it must, in all cases, be an inalienable requirement. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
rapporteur.

Commissioner, I would also like to send my regards to your excellent team. Ladies and gentlemen, Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the Union’s external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 that we are discussing today has three objectives: transferring Taiwan to the positive list, transferring other third countries or territories – Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau – to the positive list and the situation of the Northern Mariana Islands. The situation of the Northern Mariana Islands does not pose any problems, as its inhabitants are, as you are aware, US citizens.  With regard to the requests to transfer the third countries that I listed, the Commission finds no justification for removing the visa requirement, and neither do we. In the case of Taiwan, this Asian island has experienced commendable democratic, social and economic development. Democratic institutions have been firmly established since 1996, when the first direct presidential elections were held. The President is the Head of the Government, and is elected by the people of Taiwan via universal suffrage for a four-year term. Legislative power currently lies with the Legislative Yuan, which has 113 members. Economically, Taiwan’s income per head of population is one of the highest in the world at USD 30 100, in July 2010, unemployment stood at 5.2%, way below the European average, which was 10.1% in the same month. During the first quarter of 2010, economic growth hit 13.27%, whilst during the first half of 2010, the balance of trade surplus stood at USD 12.1 billion. Figures published by the International Monetary Fund in 2009 placed Taiwan’s economy 25th in the world, with a gross national product of USD 379 billion. It should be pointed out that in 1950, Taiwan was poorer than Ghana, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Until 1960, it was more reliant on commodities exports than countries like Kenya, South Africa and Lebanon. Today, however, products manufactured in Taiwan account for more than 97% of the country’s exports. All this has meant that Taiwan’s net migration rate stands at just 0.15%. For this reason, it is very unlikely that we will have to deal with any illegal immigrants from Taiwan. According to data supplied by the Commission, in 2006-2008, only 45 illegal immigrants throughout the entire European Union were found to have come from Taiwan. As far as the security of travel documents is concerned, I would like to point out that Taiwanese electronic passports meet all the anti-counterfeiting standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The situation of dispersed Taiwanese should be looked at closely, as even if they have passports issued by the authorities, they need prior authorisation to enter Taiwan. For this reason, it would seem logical for the European Union to maintain a similar approach regarding those people, as my report proposes. Currently, Taiwan does not require visas from the majority of the Member States, except for Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria. The Taiwanese authorities have nevertheless undertaken to ensure that a visa waiver is in place for nationals of those countries by 11 November, in other words, tomorrow. This is a formal commitment of which the Presidency of the Council, the European Commission and Parliament have been notified, along with the permanent representations of the countries concerned. For this reason, Mr President, and for other reasons which I shall mention in my second speech, it is worth us granting the visa exemption to Taiwan, as the United Kingdom and Ireland did last year.

Mr President, noblesse oblige
, so I would like to start by saying that I am infinitely grateful for the support that all fellow Members representing their political groups have given to the report that I have had the honour to present to the House. I would also like to thank you for supporting my work. It would not, however, be fair if I did not say that the person mainly responsible is Commissioner Malmström, whose support, energy and excellent team have made it possible to drive forward this action, which I would describe as an act of justice. There is nothing more to be said, Mr President, except to add that I would also like to congratulate the people of Taiwan, the Taiwanese authorities and, of course, the excellent team of diplomats that Taiwan has in the world, particularly in Brussels.

Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Fajon on producing a report that involved so much commitment in such a determined way. I would also like to congratulate my colleague and friend, Mrs Corazza Bildt, for her determination and passion in taking on the commitment of visa exemptions for Bosnia and Herzegovina and for Albania, two countries that desperately need them. Like you, I, too, was in Sarajevo and Mostar during the war, and I too witnessed Milosevic’s mass population displacements and the solidarity of the Albanians. That is why I am expressing my joy here today, Mr President, because, happily, justice is being done. Since the Salonica Summit in June 2003, when the European Union at last took the welcome step of committing to exempt the Western Balkans from visas, following the first stage when the two countries did not fulfil the requirements, we can now reaffirm and welcome the commitment that finally, Albanians and Bosnians are going to be able to travel to EU territory. Mr President, Commissioner, the need to bring stability to the Balkans, especially to countries that will certainly join the Union in the future, and to facilitate the mobility of a population that is currently isolated, must, in my view, be one of Parliament’s political obligations.

Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to condemn the degrading and anti-democratic treatment by Hugo Chávez’s government of those who defend freedom and human rights. The detention of my colleague, Mr Iturgaiz, at Caracas airport cannot be overlooked. It is not the first time that the regime has launched an attack on members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Our mission as Members of this House is not limited to within the EU. It also involves promoting the values on which the Union is based such as freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. It is evident that this task is not well received by those that seek to impose totalitarian ideas on their citizens. The result of the parliamentary elections held on 27 September leaves room for hope, although we should all be concerned about the reaction to the progress made by the Venezuelan opposition. What can we expect from a government that harbours terrorists from the Oker terrorist cell, of an executive body that includes an alleged ETA murderer as the head of security of the Venezuelan National Land Institute, or of a government that ignores extradition requests for numerous terrorists who have fled justice? Obviously, we can expect nothing. Madam President, such contemptible attitudes deserve a strong reaction and the firmest possible rejection by Parliament. President. -

 Mr President, the security situation in Iraq is growing more precarious by the day. Since Major-General al-Karawi was killed in the Anbar province last December, violence in the region has peaked with clashes between government forces and ISIL. Fallujah is under siege, cut off from humanitarian supplies, and its residents labelled terrorists by their own prime minister, which is ludicrous. And it is not just Sunnis who are targeted but other minorities too. In Camp Liberty members of the Iranian Resistance, whose asylum-seeker status has now been officially recognised by the United States in addition to the European Union, live at the mercy of Prime Minister al-Maliki and those who control him from Tehran. We know that a new massacre is being planned by Prime Minister al-Maliki in Camp Liberty. Heat-oriented missiles have been transported to Baghdad by Iranian Quds forces in collaboration with Prime Minister al-Maliki. We know it. The High Representative knows it and I suppose that the President of the Council also knows. Inaction or soft diplomacy is not an option when three thousand men and women are under deadly threat. It is time for the High Representative and the Member States to do something effective for once. (Applause) President. -

In relation to this, Baroness Ashton, I ask you immediately to do the following. Tell Prime Minister Maliki that, if there is another murder or the seven hostages are not freed, this will have severe consequences at a diplomatic, financial and political level for him and we will take him to an international court to answer for these crimes.

 Mr President, Mr Juncker, if I remember correctly, you are currently the most senior member of the prime ministers of the European Council. You have seen my country, Spain, evolve from being part of the euro solution to being a founder member, and to today unfortunately being part of the euro problem, due to the government’s mismanagement. The Spanish Government has undertaken some reforms, but these are clearly still not enough to regenerate confidence in our country, confidence that existed in the past and that will exist again in the future. What advice would you give the next prime minister following the forthcoming elections in Spain? What reforms do you believe we should continue to carry out in Spain in order to recover confidence in the euro area, over which you preside? Antonio López-Istúriz White  (PPE

Mr President, the European Union is founded on values such as equality, solidarity and respect for all languages. We all share these principles. As Spanish Members, we support the idea of having a patents system for the whole of the European Union, and I congratulate my colleague, Mr Lehne, on that part of the report. We support anything that improves and expands the internal market. However, for such an important matter, a course has been chosen that is provided for in the Treaty – enhanced cooperation – which should be the last resort and fulfil a series of conditions. In our view, enhanced cooperation, on which we will vote tomorrow, is contrary to Articles 118 and 326 of the Treaty. Moreover, I believe that in the Council, the rules of the game have been changed, but my government will deal with that. The new Treaty is an unquestionably useful tool for the EU, but it cannot be used to establish a multi-speed Europe. Many countries that currently support enhanced cooperation will soon suffer the consequences themselves and, if the Council and the Commission continue to use enhanced cooperation in this way, ultimately we will all lose. Spanish is spoken by 850 million people. Out of the three languages proposed by the European Commission for the patents system, only one of them is comparable to Spanish in terms of size. What criteria were used? Efficiency? Are we talking about EUR 1 850? Then why not use only English and leave the other two languages, so we will also save by doing it three times rather than 20 times. Is it about timing? It was not Spain that opposed a patent in the past, it was other countries, which are now rushing to have one. Is it to do with politics, as I suspect? Care should be taken with bureaucratic manoeuvres that distance millions of citizens – and thousands of businesses that use Spanish – from the reality of the European Union. The system proposed by the Commission is contrary to the right of Europeans to express themselves in their language, it prioritises one language over others, it is clear discrimination against competition, it fragments the market and creates legal uncertainty. This battle has only just begun. Due to the haste of some, we are going to be faced with a legal action lasting several years in the Court of Justice, as my government has already said. The three institutions will have to give an account of the procedure followed and of why the warnings were ignored. This situation can be remedied if we return to the spirit and the letter of the treaties, which Spain has respected. Antonio López-Istúriz White  (PPE

Mr President, I think that all of us who believe in the European Union have reason to congratulate ourselves, particularly in these times of economic and sometimes political crisis. I believe that we have moved forward. We are taking a big step with the creation and launch of this European External Action Service. I would like to congratulate not only the High Representative, but also those involved – such as, for example, within the European Parliament, our colleague Mr Brok – who have facilitated the achievement of the agreements that were necessary for this. I especially liked the phrase that you used, Baroness Ashton, about how it is the interests of the European Union that need to be defended above all. I would also say to you – this is not advice, simply a comment – taking the position of my colleague, Mr Salafranca, that what is needed here is effectiveness. Moreover, I would add humility and effectiveness, following the example that the President of the Council, Mr Van Rompuy, is giving to us. I am sure that you will succeed and, of course, as General Secretary of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to give you my support, together with that of our entire group, in this enormous task that you are faced with.

 Madam President, I am addressing my speech to Orlando Zapata’s mother and to those suffering along with him in the fight for freedom in Cuba: they are not alone. Today, through this resolution – for which, in my capacity as Secretary-General of my party, I would like to thank the authors, and especially all the parties that have signed it – Parliament is speaking out as one against this isolated and decrepit dictatorship. Today, we are signing the beginning of the international death sentence for this regime. I am convinced, based on the majority of the speeches that I have heard, that we are all united in firmly and clearly condemning the death of your son. Many of us, however, are going further than this statement: you can rest assured that we will remain vigilant in order to secure the unconditional release of all political prisoners on the island. We will remain vigilant regarding the situation of human rights violations on the island. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will, of course, fight to maintain the European Union’s common position, and I am sure based on what I have heard that many others will do the same. We will not give mixed signals, but rather a clear guide for achieving our dream of seeing a democratic Cuba. The supreme sacrifice made by Orlando has produced a response in the good consciences of the whole world. Let us ensure that the silent sacrifice of thousands of Cubans is celebrated in the near future in a free Cuba. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo

 Mr President, allow me to begin by expressing my thanks to the Secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, particularly Ms Leffler and others who collaborated with me to make this report possible, including Ms Martín, Mr Kox and Ms Remacle. Mr President, it is almost over a year since the Committee on Petitions decided to draw up a report on waste management in the EU. The decision was taken after it was established that large numbers of repeat petitions were being put forward, condemning the poor waste management carried out by the authorities, the location of certain rubbish dumps, the destruction of some natural areas, and so on. The Committee on Petitions was sensitive to these claims, and sent several fact-finding missions to the areas concerned in order to verify in situ
 the truth of the complaints made by the petitioners. All of this has led us here today, to the plenary session of the European Parliament, in order to make it clear that the proper application of current legislation by Member States is an unresolved issue that requires particular attention and on which we should remain vigilant. As I said at the beginning of my speech, most European citizens expect public authorities to provide efficient and effective public services in terms of health, education, transport and security. However, the issue that provokes a growing number of petitions is the apparent inability of public authorities in many countries to deal satisfactorily with the problem of waste management. The European Union has adopted a broad raft of legislation, applicable in all Member States, in order to ensure that the legal framework exists to deal with the inevitable result of our modern lifestyle in terms of all the things we discard as waste from our household, from our place of work, from our hospitals, from our industries and so on. It is obvious to all that failure to manage such issues, and failure to prioritise efforts in this respect, produces not only negative effects on human health and well-being, but also on the viability of the planet and its environment. Judging by the petitions received, the concern of many local communities is growing, and this indicates that waste management is becoming a major political and social problem and people expect the European Union to deal with it somehow. An analysis of the waste management policies implemented in the Member States provides very contrasting information and serious breaches of EU legislation. The Commission reported in January 2011 that 177 infringement cases concerning landfills had been launched since the deadline for implementing the Landfill Directive in 2001. They had furthermore calculated that there were at the very least 619 illegal landfills still being used in the EU. In its strategic report on the prevention and recycling of waste, the Commission clearly demonstrates that it is using its best efforts to address the issue of waste management, and it also outlines its medium-term proposals. It should be recalled in this context, Mr President, that the large number of infringement cases mentioned aim at ensuring legal compliance, yet from the petitioners’ perspective, more effort needs to be made to ensure proper follow-up actions in the actual implementation of the law. Closely linked to the waste management process, although upstream of the process, are the EU directives dealing with environmental impact assessments and the access of citizens to information concerning the environment. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Georgieva for her interesting opinions and also my fellow Members who have participated in this debate. To some of the latter, I would like to say that comments have been made about the appropriateness or otherwise of holding this debate in the Committee on Petitions, and of referring the matter on from that Committee to this House. With your permission, Mr President, I would like to commend and defend the Committee on Petitions as an appropriate setting in which to debate these issues. I say this given that those who submitted petitions, the citizens of the European Union, have addressed the Committee on Petitions. Apart from the fact that citizens can address other committees, such as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and bearing in mind that opinions may be developed and reports drawn up in other committees, I think that when citizens approach the Committee on Petitions, they want us to respond and provide a solution to their problems. Clearly, we cannot look the other way or divert attention. Were we to do so, there would be no point to the work and actions of the Committee on Petitions within the European Parliament or, indeed, to the very existence of that Committee. In addition, I would like to say to certain colleagues that the petitions have referred systematically to the constant deficiencies that occur with waste management and to the real, habitual inability of the Member States to fulfil their legal obligations. This really is the way things are at present. These thoughts and problems have also been included in the report, however, hence the request for the Member States to transpose the Waste Management Directive without further delay, and to guarantee that all its provisions are fully complied with, especially through the establishment and application of comprehensive waste management plans. Therefore, Mr President, I believe that through this report and Ms Georgieva’s own words, a very direct course has been set to try to resolve all the problems that have been outlined by the groups, many problems that are related to this issue, but I also believe that it needs to be emphasised that delaying is not an option, nor can a blind eye be turned, when it comes to resolving the many, many issues and petitions that are being received from countries throughout the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pass on a message to you all from Oswaldo Payá, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize by Parliament. ‘Dear friends, the people of Cuba want change, they want to enter peacefully into a new phase of their lives, leaving behind anything that involves hate, violence, repression, lies and fear, opening themselves up to reconciliation and ready to take the path of progress in every respect. These changes, which are being imposed on us by law, are already present in the hearts and minds of the Cuban people, but the civil and political rights of the people need to be respected. There need to be free and democratic elections, and freedom to travel, work and participate in the economic, political and cultural life of the country. Changes are rights, and those rights are lacking in Cuba, where many people are still being persecuted for promoting the rights of the Cuban people and also imprisoned for that cause. The European common position is focused on solidarity and that position should be maintained. You should know that although the Cuban Government is not initiating the changes that many Cubans who are supporting the Varela Project and other civil initiatives desire, there are people working to achieve these peaceful changes at the moment. These are the initiatives that you must support, while remaining consistent with the common position so that it is also a joint approach.’ Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, it is my pleasure to come here, as we do every year, to present the annual report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions during the year 2009. As you know, this year, the activity of the Committee on Petitions was marked by the change from the sixth to the seventh parliamentary term, which has meant significant alterations to the composition of the committee, since two thirds of its members are involved for the first time. The report aims to offer a clear vision of the activity of the Committee on Petitions during the year and, ultimately, a more specific explanation of what submitting a petition to the European Parliament involves, as well as the possible result of the process, what it can achieve and its limitations. This report also examines the progress made in applying previous recommendations whose objective was to improve the committee’s work, and highlights the main challenges for the future in light of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, as well as confirming the right to petition the European Parliament as one of the pillars of European citizenship, has also established the necessary bases for increasing public participation in the European Union’s decision-making process, offering Europeans the opportunity to suggest improvements or additions to the Union’s legislation. To this end, the Committee on Petitions welcomes the fact that it is able, under Rule 50 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, to work alongside the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on drawing up the report on the European Citizens’ Initiative, which should be finished late this year. Moreover, following the same context of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament’s Committee on Petitions should forge closer working links with similar committees in Member States’ national and regional parliaments in order to promote mutual understanding of petitions on European issues and to ensure the swiftest response to members of the public at the most appropriate level. I would also draw your attention to the legally binding force acquired by the Charter of Fundamental Rights with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and underline the importance of the Charter in making fundamental rights clearer and more visible to all Europeans. I trust that all necessary procedural steps will be taken to ensure that the institutional aspects of EU accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will be taken. This goal is of vital importance if we take into account the problem of violations of property rights that the Committee on Petitions faces in certain Member States on a daily basis, knowing that neither the committee nor Parliament is in a position to take any legal action. I would also stress the excellent relations that Parliament has with the European Ombudsman. We particularly appreciate the efforts of the European Ombudsman to raise public awareness of its work, as well as to identify and resolve cases of maladministration by the European institutions. To this end, we support the idea that the European Ombudsman should establish an administrative code of conduct for the European Union administration. We call for the development of an online system that clearly indicates the various complaints mechanisms available to the public and which of these is most appropriate to their interests; the establishment of an online one-stop shop would be needed in order to achieve this. However, not everything was going to be positive. I would like to take this opportunity to protest at the practice – which has been constant since 2007 – of the Directorate-General for the Presidency and the Directorate-General for Communication, whereby items that are not petitions are registered as petitions, according to Rule 201(1) of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. I am talking about the so-called ‘non-petitions’. Processing them is an unnecessary waste of time, on top of the cost of dedicating staff to this. In order for you to realise the importance of this point, I will give you one figure: these so-called ‘non-petitions’ are up to 25% of the petitions registered. The practice of such maladministration endangers the rights of EU citizens. Finally, but no less important because of that, I would point out the need to adopt a code of conduct for the internal processing of petitions. To this end, I would encourage the secretariat and the representatives of the political groups to work on drawing up a revised guide for the benefit of Members on the internal regulations and procedures of the Committee on Petitions. In conclusion, my final words – and how could it be any other way, Mr President – are of thanks to the committee’s secretariat for its work and support in drawing up this report. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo,  
rapporteur. 
– (ES) 
Mr President, thank you to all of the Members for their contributions. I believe that there is a thread running through all the speeches given by my fellow Members. This thread is the importance of the Committee on Petitions, because the faith and hopes of thousands of Europeans that their principal and real problems can be solved often rest on this committee. That is why, of all the committees, the Committee on Petitions – and several Members have said this – is the one that has the most direct relationship with the public, as Europeans are directly involved in it. The significance of this committee means that it must be safeguarded and loose ends tied up, so that all of us – Parliament, the Commission and the petitioners – may feel that the committee is even more useful. With your consent, Mr President, I will finish by asking the Commissioner to take note. I know that the Commissioner will do so, because many of the complaints that we have heard from fellow Members are completely justified. The following comments that have been made are totally justified: there is a lack of information, and it is true that certain petitions have been paralysed and were not completed. I therefore believe that we must not be distracted but must see the issue through to the end. Those petitions that have been initiated, and which remain open and with unresolved issues, must be resolved. I believe that in your capacity as Commissioner, you must make efforts to try to solve the complaints that you have heard here in this House today. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

 Mr President, a Spanish Central Criminal Court judge has confirmed what many of us were already aware of, namely that Hugo Chávez, the President of Venezuela, cooperates with ETA and FARC terrorists. This proves that Mr Chávez is in cahoots with terrorists, that he gives sanctuary to murderous terrorists on Venezuelan soil, and that he helps them by bestowing official positions in the Venezuelan Government upon them. Essentially, Mr Chávez is cooperating with ETA criminals. As a Basque, a Spaniard and a European, I wish to denounce and condemn the appalling attitude of the dictator Hugo Chávez. I urge the European institutions to take all necessary measures to condemn Mr Chávez and thus also condemn his policies in support of terrorists. I would also remind Mr Rodríguez Zapatero’s government, which currently holds the rotating Presidency of the European Union, that there is no point in being friendly and wishy-washy with Mr Chávez as it has been to date. There is no point either in displays of affection, or in friendly gestures and cooperation, because when the Spanish Government goes back on its word and humbles itself before Mr Chávez as it has done recently, this is tantamount to punishing the victims of terrorism, disdaining the Spanish justice system and thereby punishing freedom and democracy. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE
).  
– (ES)
 Mr President, I regret that some of those present in the House today should opt to congratulate Mr Chávez, who is in cahoots with terrorists and has included ETA leaders in his government. My group and I, faced with a choice between Mr Chávez and a Central Criminal Court judge like Mr Velasco from a state governed by the rule of law, have no hesitation in supporting that Central Criminal Court judge. Furthermore, if Mr Rodríguez Zapatero were to stop being all matey with Mr Chávez and humbling himself before him, and instead treated Mr Chávez as what he is, a terrorist supporter, the credibility of Spanish foreign policy on the international arena would be enhanced. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to condemn in this House the continual provocations, abuses of power and threats by the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez. With his dictatorial method of government he is threatening, among other things, freedom of expression in Venezuela and democratic order in Latin America. President Chávez has closed down thirty radio stations and some television channels. He is threatening and punishing journalists in Venezuela because they do not support his autocratic regime. Because of all this, Mr President, it should also be pointed out that while there are power cuts, water shortages and food shortages in Venezuela, and poverty is continuing to grow due to poor management by the Chávez Government, the Venezuelan tyrant is trying to cover it all up by blowing up border bridges and threatening Colombia. He is praising international terrorists and aligning himself with the despotic dictators of the world, and his words and speeches are continual provocations and war cries aimed at destabilising the American continent. This is why Parliament, which is always committed to freedom and democracy in any part of the world, must strongly condemn the autocratic and dictatorial policies of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE
).

Mr President, I would like my first words to be words of congratulation, as is only right, to Mrs Paliadeli, on the report she has presented, first of all before the Committee on Petitions and now here in plenary. I would also like to endorse the very sensible comments made by Mrs Gruny and Mrs Mazzoni, my colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), but, Mr President, I would like to add that the role of the Ombudsman is essential in a democratic institution. That is the conclusion that we in the Committee on Petitions have drawn, during the many visits by Mr Diamandouros to present his annual reports, like the one we are today examining in this House, or other reports within his remit. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not propose to drown you in numbers. However, although progress has been made in the role of the Ombudsman, I have no doubt that if we were to conduct a survey of European citizens on the role of the Ombudsman, his work and his activities, we would unfortunately find that citizens see him as remote and, in many cases, are not even aware of his existence. Perhaps this is because the Ombudsman’s decisions are not binding, as he himself reminded us here, or perhaps because his work is very restricted as far as the Member States are concerned, as Mr Diamandouros has pointed out in this House. However, if we want to provide a service to citizens, then this institution – the European Parliament – and the Committee on Petitions must make an effort to strengthen and promote the work of the Ombudsman. While there are certainly many petitions, as has been pointed out here, especially on the lack of transparency, I am sure that the proper provision of information – such as the new website, which is now working, which I welcome – would make a much greater contribution, and I would like to insist on this point, to the objective that, I think, will be endorsed by all: that all citizens of the European Union should be aware of and be able to contact the Ombudsman. For this reason, I wish the Ombudsman all the luck in the world and every success, because his successes will be the successes of European citizens as a whole. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

Mr President, I would be pleased if certain left-wing Members of this Parliament who are issuing resolute condemnations of Honduras would issue similarly forceful condemnations of what is happening in Cuba, or what Mr Chávez is doing in Venezuela and in Latin America, because, unfortunately, some people still hanker after and support the Berlin Wall, the purges of Stalin and even the mummy of Lenin more than democratic elections in a country, as in this case in Honduras. Having said this, with the forthcoming elections, some serious thought should be given to what has happened in this Central American country. Mr President, presidential elections in Honduras were called 16 months ago. The members of the electoral court, which is the body responsible for managing elections, were appointed before 28 June – they were therefore appointed under Mr Zelaya’s mandate. The six presidential candidates went through the primaries procedure, and the majority of the candidates want the elections in Honduras to be held. Therefore, why do some people not want to recognise the electoral process, if it was the natural outcome, whether or not Mr Zelaya was in power in Honduras? On 30 October, the negotiators of both sides made a commitment, it is true, by signing an agreement, to seek a solution to the crisis. The agreement contained a set of key points supported by both sides. The negotiators of the deposed President Zelaya did not establish, however, who should head the government of unity. It is therefore clear that the European People’s Party is in favour of the elections being held, under conditions of transparency, democracy and freedom, and we are going to support them with observers from our group. Let us not forget that it was the mediator, Óscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, who requested that they should go. In reply to a question from the delegation for Central America, he answered that it was necessary to send them, because the Óscar Arias Foundation itself was going to send observers to Honduras. We are going to do precisely that, because the international mediator, Óscar Arias, is also requesting it. Carlos Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

Mr President, this summer, the terrorist group ETA murdered three people in Spain, three people who defended law and freedom: an officer of the national police and two officers of the civil guard. I would like to express our solidarity, support and care to their families. ETA is a criminal group that has no place in Europe, because in the European Union there is no room for radicalism, totalitarianism or terrorist murders. The European Parliament and all the European institutions should therefore continue to condemn the ETA terrorists and continue to work to remove and eradicate the cancer of terrorist attacks by ETA and its accomplices from our continent I therefore want my first speech in this first ordinary plenary sitting of the European Parliament of this legislature to remember and pay tribute to all the victims of ETA terrorism, to condemn the terrorist organisation ETA in this House and to ask that, as Europeans, we all work together, with the law on our side, to smoke out ETA and its supporters, for the good of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.

Mr President, I want to concentrate on Ms Patrão’s report on shark fishing, and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate her on her excellent work and her spirit of collaboration. Having said that, there are not many others to be congratulated, particularly the European Commission, because this proposal is a clear demonstration of what should never happen in the fisheries sector. Its partisan approach and the clear lack of consensus contradict the principles of the next reform, especially the bottom-up decision-making process involving consultation – of both the sector involved and civil society – in order to reach a compromise. Commissioner, a compromise on measures that have such a serious impact on a fleet’s future cannot just be a compromise between you and the NGOs. You have positioned yourself exclusively on their side and that means that the Commission is working in the interests of one part of civil society, yet there is no compromise with those who are affected. I, personally, have been very much involved in this matter and have worked tirelessly with the sector to convince it of the need to relax its initial positions so that no one could object to the final proposals. I have done the same with the NGOs, but it has proved impossible because they knew that the Commission was on their side. Why, therefore, would they want to seek a compromise? In relation to what you said about the international dimension, Commissioner, I have just attended a meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICAAT), at which every single resolution on sharks was rejected, including one like the text that you are proposing: the debate on it lasted not even a minute and, indeed, the European Commission did not even say anything. Therefore, Commissioner, do you believe that under these circumstances it is necessary to condemn a fleet in the face of its competitors? Would it not have been much better to wait for ICAAT to take a decision? I would like to ask you to state publicly here that no finning takes place in the European Union. This is because of the comments during the NGOs’ campaign of lies. I would ask you to state whether or not there is any finning in the European Union. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, I believe that the Commissioner is also here to answer our questions. I asked her to state publicly whether or not the removal of fins, or finning, is common practice in the EU fleet, as many Members have said. I would like her to say whether or not that is true.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the rapporteurs for their reports, but may I highlight the excellent collaboration with Mr Gallagher, which has led to the adoption at first reading, with the agreement of all the institutions, of measures that will enable swift action to be taken to put an end to unsustainable situations, such as we are experiencing with Iceland and the distribution of mackerel stocks. With regard to the Stevenson report on the common organisation of the market (CMO), I shall make particular reference to the chapter on consumer information, to which Commissioner Damanaki referred, in which I believe the compromises reached clarify and simplify the original proposal. Commissioner, I believe that proposal confused quantity of information with quality of information, since it would – as in the case of Article 42(2) – call for a whole series of data to be given, complicating and unnecessarily increasing the costs to the industry, without being of any relevance to consumers, who would also be incapable of assimilating so many details. We have also tried to find a balance between the interests of the various segments of the fleet and industry. For example, the obligation to show the date of catch is in the interests of the smaller-scale fishing fleets but is very detrimental for the other fleets catching fresh fish, without affecting the quality of the catch. Replacing it with the date of landing, as included in the compromise reached, gives the consumer the same guarantees while allowing the date of catch to be included as part of the voluntary information, if so wished. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I want to thank the Commissioner for attending. I hope he can hear me. I can see the Commissioner leaving, which is really depressing, as what he said and the solution he proposed in this notorious compromise he supports so much is a solution that is totally against the principles of the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU). That is why I would have liked the Commissioner to hear this debate. Moreover, the problem is that the Commission is handling all of this in a secretive, clandestine manner. It has been pure chance that some Members of Parliament, such as myself, have found out what has been going on. Neither the Commissioner for the Environment nor the Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries have ever been here to raise this issue when they know that the fight against IUU fishing is an absolute priority for us in Parliament. I would also like to know the reasons behind supporting the interests of countries involved in chartering ships, such as Brazil, New Zealand, Australia and the United States, when the price to pay will be to void Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, the objective of which is to combat illegal fishing. It will also weaken the European Union’s position in each and every international forum. That is the way it is. This issue precisely began to unravel in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). I also want to emphasise what has already been said, which is that this sets a very serious precedent, because all of this, as he said himself, will now be an issue for debate in all the international forums, especially in the regional fisheries organisations. Coincidentally, this will be discussed in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, given that it is one of the regional fisheries organisations where the most chartering occurs. It should not be forgotten that the philosophy on which the fight against IUU fishing is based is precisely the double safety net of state control over the port and flag state control over worldwide fishing catches. That is what has sown the seeds of panic in the exporting countries, which have suddenly seen the attractive EU market close. That is the root of all these problems. I hope, therefore, that this will be fully resolved by other means. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, unlike my colleagues, I believe that Parliament has managed to achieve a text for first reading that is very balanced between the measures needed for protection and recovery of the bluefin tuna agreed with the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), maintaining fleet activity and the strengthening of control measures. To do so, the Committee on Fisheries has removed some of the rapporteur’s extreme proposals, which would have led to the halting of the activity of the fleet of European vessels, and only European vessels, with the disastrous socio-economic consequences that would have been incurred. It is worth remembering that since 2006, there have been successive recovery plans for bluefin tuna, and as well as the fact that to change the game rules half way through and for only the European fleet would be unfair and discriminatory, it is doubtful the sustainability of the resource would benefit, given that the rest of the fleets could continue to operate. Lastly, I would like to insist on the need to shorten the period for the transposition of the recommendations adopted in the headquarters of the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) into EU law. In this case, the delay has been due to the incomprehensible opposition of the European Commission and some of Parliament’s groups to including provisions for implementing acts in the article of the regulation, which had reasonably been requested by the Council, with the aim of achieving legal security when it comes to the interpretation of particular technical aspects that could impede compliance with the control obligations set by ICCAT. Our political group, therefore, will oppose Parliament’s unilateral declaration proposed in Amendment 4. Carmen Fraga Estévez,

 Mr President, the fact that we are currently within the extension period of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Morocco is simply because the Commission did not fulfil its obligation at the time by requesting a negotiating mandate or reporting the agreement well in advance if it was not being fulfilled. This is nothing to do with the fishing fleet: they are neither responsible nor should they have to suffer the consequences. Therefore, I strongly advocate resolving this situation by ratifying it. I do not agree with those who oppose it, whether it is for the political issues in the Sahara, or the negative results in the fishing evaluation report. In that regard, I would like to refer back to 2006 and my report on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco when this Chamber was very firm both in terms of the benefits that the Saharan people should receive, as well as denouncing a disastrous negotiation, the loopholes in which have led to the poor results. I would stress, however, that I do not think any of these issues are going to be resolved by sending the fishing fleet home. On the contrary, I think we should look at the future of our fishing relationship with Morocco. Furthermore, Commissioner, we are again in the situation where there are less than three months of the extension period remaining and there is still no negotiating mandate. The sector is again plunged into uncertainty, but this time it has taken the initiative and acted responsibly alongside the Moroccan fishing sector and, with the agreement of their respective administrations, together they have drawn up an action plan for the future, which was delivered to you in Brussels last week. This is the reason why Mr Haglund, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and I, on behalf of my group, have tabled an oral question and a motion for a resolution which look to the future, a future based on new foundations which try to make up for the mistakes that were made and which have the approval of all interested parties. I simply request that the Commission is … (The President cut off the speaker) Carmen Fraga Estévez,

 Mr President, while we are waiting for proposed reforms of the common fisheries policy (CFP), the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wishes to express its alarm, once again, at the economic state of the fisheries sector. Until the proposal for its new common organisation of markets is tabled, the sector will continue to have almost no room for manoeuvre when setting prices. The rules on imports, many of which originate with illegal fishing, remain unfair competition for EU production: new monitoring obligations require companies to mobilise more of their resources and the general crisis does not exactly encourage increased consumption of quality products. To this must be added the upward trend in fuel prices, which is once again threatening companies that have already managed to survive the crisis of 2008. Far-reaching reforms of the CFP are envisaged and, in light of that, and in a context of ever decreasing structural aid, many companies could need liquidity to restructure or adapt themselves with a view to 2013. That is why we have tabled this oral question and this motion for a resolution before the House, given that this aid does not cost the EU budget anything and that, furthermore, the increase in aid being requested falls far short of the de minimis
 aid received by other sectors, such as transport or agriculture. We do not want to see ourselves in a situation like that in 2008, when we debated the package of measures adopted in extremis
 by Commissioner Borg. I would also like to say something to you, Commissioner: it is true that there are some Member States that will and others that will not be able to give this aid, and that, according to you, this will create disparity. However, greater disparity is created by the fact that some Member States do not cofinance the European Fisheries Fund, and that is something that is generally accepted. What needs to be proposed is aid, and any Member States wishing to defend their sectors will also be able to defend them. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I must begin by regretting once again the complications that this report has encountered because of the resistance of the Council and the Commission to accepting Parliament’s powers of co-decision. In this case, we have a proposal for Greenland, as an overseas country and territory, to be able to export under the same conditions as those applied to a European Union Member State. This situation would benefit both Greenland, which exports 87% of its fisheries products to the European Union, and the Union; Denmark in particular, which is the recipient of the majority of these exports. One of the conditions for including Greenland in the single market import arrangements is that it should accept EU health rules, and this does not pose a problem in the least. Despite the trade in fisheries products being subject to the common organisation of the market, the Commission, using the need for compliance with health rules as an excuse, tabled its proposal based on Article 203 of the Treaty, which meant a simple and straightforward consultation procedure for us. Both the Committee on Fisheries and the legal services pointed out this anomaly from the outset. However, as it presents no problems in terms of content, and given its importance to Greenland, we are allowing the report to be processed under the consultation procedure. Imagine our surprise when, just as we were about to vote on the text and without prior warning, the Council adopted a completely different proposal, with numerous changes attempting to obscure the clear link with the common organisation of the market and so avoid co-decision. Since Parliament had – as I said before – already adopted the text using the consultation procedure without any problems, such manoeuvring was uncalled-for. Nevertheless, as we were faced with a new text, and given the clear proof that the Council’s goal was to erode Parliament’s powers, we decided that, this time, we would use those powers to the full and request a formal opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs. In that opinion, the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs was – and I am quoting directly from the text – that ‘the purpose of the proposed decision is to require Greenland to transpose EU health rules as a condition for the application of the EU internal market rules as regards fisheries’, as specified in Article 3 of the proposal itself, which guarantees that the agreement’s rules will be adapted to the applicable rules established in the Union as regards animal health and food safety, as well as the common organisation of the market in fishery products. Consequently, the Committee on Legal Affairs came to the unanimous decision that Articles 204 and 43(2) of the Treaty, along with Protocol No 34, which includes specific arrangements and procedures for products subject to the common organisation of the market in fishery products in Greenland, should form the legal basis for the proposal. Therefore, as rapporteur, I drew up another draft report, modifying the legal basis. That is what we are tabling for adoption tomorrow and, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, it is our first reading. All, then, that remains is for me to tell the Commission and the Council – which I believe to be absent – that they now have an opportunity to correct and recognise the new legal basis, and, therefore, to consider this the first reading, as we will be doing tomorrow. The problem is with the legal basis and not the content. I call for this problem to be solved with a view to the future. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur. 
− (ES)
 Mr President, I should like to give special thanks to the Commissioner for the answer she gave to my question, saying that she would be ready to accept the change to the legal basis, and I hope that the Council will also follow the same line that the Commissioner has set out. In any case, I had been considering the possibility of asking for this report to be returned to committee before it reached the final vote, but I later thought better of it and realised that it could only delay even further this proposal, which I believe is positive for Greenland and for the European Union, and that it would be advisable not to delay it more. I hope, anyhow, that the Council will go along with the intentions of the Committee on Fisheries, which are entirely justified, and I hope that a solution will be reached, given that the only problem is the legal basis and not the content. In any case, I am pleased that we have achieved this result; moreover, we always have the option of going to the Court of Justice if we see that it is advisable to continue with this matter. Anyhow, we will demonstrate goodwill tomorrow, by issuing our opinion, and we hope that the Council will respond and consider this Parliament’s first reading, as I have said. Therefore, thank you to the Commissioner for being prepared to cooperate on this issue in a straightforward way, and thanks to all my colleagues who have worked on and supported this report. All that remains is to hope that the Council will go along with our intentions, which are justified, as I have said, and endorsed not only by the Committee on Legal Affairs but also by the legal services of the European Parliament.

 Mr President, the Protocol of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Mauritania is due to expire on 31 July 2012. In view of the importance of this Protocol, the Commission has already asked the Council for a mandate for its renegotiation. We have been informed that the Council is currently studying a mandate proposal and will decide shortly. On the strength of Article 218 of the Treaty, which grants Parliament special powers in the final approval of fisheries agreements, we have already voiced our intent to make full use of the possibilities granted to us by the Treaty and the interinstitutional framework agreement to participate in shaping fisheries agreements, with the right to full information on an equal footing with the Council. We believe we should be involved in the process from the moment when the negotiating mandate is approved. The Fisheries Commission has thus decided to introduce a new procedure starting with the Mauritania Protocol, whereby we will submit an oral question and receive information on the future negotiations from the onset of the process. The procedure will also allow us to produce a draft resolution setting out our concerns on the agreement in issue – in this case, Mauritania – with the request that they be taken on board by the negotiators and ultimately become part of the final Protocol. The agreement with Mauritania is crucial both for the country itself and for the European Union. For Mauritania, it represents 29% of the national budget; for the European Union, it is one of the three mixed agreements still in force, allowing the presence of several different modes of fishing in the country’s waters, all of them vital for EU fish supplies. The significance of this agreement and the experience we have built up have prompted us to put forward a number of suggestions that will be reflected in the common resolution set to be negotiated by the political groups in the coming days, and also to voice a number of concerns on the way in which the current Protocol works. These concerns include the following: Firstly, Parliament must understand the importance of securing the industry’s support for the financial contributions and their correct use, bearing in mind the needs of both the industry and the Mauritanian fishing authorities in making headway towards an advanced, sustainable fisheries policy. Secondly, the joint scientific committee has a key role to play and care must be taken that it fulfils this role properly, as it is the body responsible for assessing resources and issuing recommendations on the biological status of populations, and therefore on the fishing opportunities available to the different fleets operating in Mauritanian waters. Thirdly, more information is needed on the catches of other non-EU countries operating in the area, so that we can accurately establish the real fisheries surplus that Mauritania can offer the EU, while also ensuring that the fishing opportunities negotiated are in line with the actual needs of the fleets. This will avoid any temptations to pay for ‘paper fish’. Fourthly, it is important, as far as the fishing fleet is concerned, to ensure that the technical measures for the different fisheries are negotiated at the same time as the fishing opportunities, thus putting an end to the absurdity of paying for resources that are technically impossible to catch. Lastly, urgent clarification is needed of Mauritania’s use of the Protocol’s monitoring provisions as regards its preference for methods other than the vessel monitoring system (VMS), and also its varying standards on ship arrests. It is important that both parties respect the agreed terms for the resolution of disputes in connection with such arrests, which must be preserved in the new Protocol. Commissioner, for all these reasons, we will be asking that the Commission, as the negotiator, takes into consideration these and other concerns, which will form part of the common resolution set to be approved at the next plenary session, and which our institution will follow very closely. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.

Mr President, Commissioner, exemption from the rules of origin is based on a very serious calculation error by the Commission regarding its impact, not only on the EU tuna sector, which is very serious, but also on the Pacific region, which we are seeking to help. Meanwhile, the real beneficiaries are almost exclusively the greedy fleets from China and South-East Asia and their processing industries. The Directorate-General for Trade established this exemption based on the fact that Papua New Guinea does not have the fishing capacity to exploit its resources. However, according to the most recent data from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, there are 41 seiners under Papua New Guinea flags operating in the area, which, in 2009, had a catch total of almost 500 000 tonnes. Out of this catch, more than 75 000 tonnes ended up in the European Union (semi-processed and processed), which makes Papua New Guinea one of the six main exporters to the European Union. It is not, therefore, true, as you say, that in order to develop Papua New Guinea’s fishing sector, other fleets needed to be given free entry. Under no circumstances can the European Union shirk its commitment to sustainable development. However, we are seeing that, under the protection of this exemption, and in order to bring in Asian investors, Papua New Guinea has amended its legislation so that it is not possible to make complaints about environmental damage, and has implemented investment rules that allow local workers and cheap labour from Asia to be hired, along with the worst imaginable labour standards. If we add to this the fact that, in the regional fisheries organisation that I mentioned, Papua New Guinea is leading other countries in flatly refusing to sign up to any international rules to manage and control fisheries, the result is that, while the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries is going the whole hog to combat illegal fishing, others are opening their doors to it. Commissioner, I have just come back from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, and I am well aware of the position that Papua New Guinea has taken. I therefore maintain the position of the Committee on Fisheries of asking for the exemption to be suspended in the review of the agreement that we are discussing. Carmen Fraga Estévez,

Mr President, thank you very much to the authors of the reports for their excellent work. I would like to focus on management plans, although I will not go into any substantial aspects, as they have already been highlighted by the rapporteurs. Instead, I will refer to the significant institutional challenges they are creating, which must be resolved. After more than a year of negotiations with the Council, Parliament has quite responsibly decided to bring the reports to first reading with the aim of exerting pressure to break the current deadlock, which affects not only these two proposals but also all the others that are to be put before us in the near future. Parliament is willing to find a compromise solution with the Council and the Commission but the key requirement for that to happen is for the Council to acknowledge and accept that the basic core of long-term management plans must fall under the ordinary legislative procedure, that is, under the legal basis of Article 43(2) of the treaty. It is incomprehensible that before the Treaty of Lisbon, when the Council also had exclusive competence in matters of TAC and quotas, Parliament was asked for its consultative opinion, whereas now, the Council claims exclusivity on these same matters, even though, according to all legal advice, Article 43(3) must be interpreted restrictively. I therefore urge the Commissioner to take account of Parliament’s position, even if any proposals – and I believe Mrs Bilbao’s question on this particular point has not been answered – were to be withdrawn or replaced by new texts. Failure to do this will compel us to refer the matter to the Court of Justice and to block future long-term plans, which is to be avoided insofar as it is a basic instrument of fisheries management. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES) 
Mr President, allow me to express my gratitude to the Council and the Commission for arriving at this excellent agreement at first reading, and I would particularly like to thank the legal services of all three institutions for their cooperation and help in resolving the problems arising from the new committee procedure following the Treaty of Lisbon. I believe that we have reached a good compromise, especially as it represents significant progress compared with the current situation, although, as in any compromise, we have all had to make concessions and be flexible, in what has been an especially complex task, as the Commission proposal arrived before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This meant that at the same time, it had to be adapted to the new situation, in particular, to Articles 290 and 291 of the treaty, relating to delegated acts and implementing acts. As this is a transposition into EU legislation of recommendations issued by a regional fisheries organisation, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) in this case, but which will be followed by many others, Parliament’s objective was fundamentally to establish a mechanism which would enable the transpositions to take place as quickly as possible, preventing internal bureaucratic delays from preventing us from responding correctly to our international obligations, as has been the case so far. Therefore, the new wording of Article 48, following the compromise reached with the Council on the subsequent amendments to this regulation, will enable the Commission both to comply with the obligations imposed by the NEAFC and to adapt to new recommendations that may arise in the future, through the delegation of powers. It is true that the Commission wanted it to be possible to revise all the articles in the proposal through delegated acts, and the compromise agrees that this will be the case for the majority of the articles, except in areas such as the recording of catches, tranships, inspections or monitoring of infringements: in other words, fundamentally matters relating to control and supervision, which will remain outside the framework of the ordinary legislative procedure. In any case, Commissioner, Parliament commits to amending this procedure if it is shown that the inclusion of these aspects within the scope of the ordinary legislative procedure could endanger compliance with the European Union’s obligations and, especially, those of the Commission, as a contracting party to the regional fisheries organisation. This is why we consider that this compromise represents a significant step forward, not only in relation to this specific proposal, but in order to lay the foundations for future discussions between the Council, the Commission and Parliament on fisheries policy. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that I believe that the example set by this most recent regulation on the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), which we are going to adopt tomorrow, is not a good one, because what has happened is precisely what we want to avoid. The Commission put forward the proposal late and the procedure has changed, as we have changed from the consultation procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure, and the proposal as a whole has been changed in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. That is exactly what we are avoiding through this compromise. Through the new wording of Article 48 of the regulation, which is the article that provides for the amendment of the regulation in future in order to transpose the various NEAFC recommendations into EU law, in the majority of the articles, we have delegated powers to the European Commission. We have only maintained and preserved the ordinary legislative procedure in a few areas, which was the compromise with the Council. A significant step forward has therefore been taken to ensure that this functions in the future, but even so, Commissioner, I have made a public commitment here that if, in the future, it does not function adequately and we are prevented from fulfilling our obligations, Parliament will be prepared to revise the procedure. I believe that we have made quite a considerable effort, and I think that this is a significant step forward as a starting point. We are sure that the Commission will be capable of using the new powers that the Council and Parliament has granted to it. Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner. I am sure that this is going to work much better than what we had in the past. Of course, Commissioner, you are the one who is going to have the tools to ensure that this is the case.

Mr President, this report originated as a response to the frustration and lack of defence of the EU fishing sector. Commissioner, this sector is not asking for protectionism, what it is asking for at this stage, given the history of disregard by those in charge of the Directorate-General for Trade, is that it is not sunk even further. In this regard, we particularly support the request in the report by Mr Cadec that negotiations on the fishing chapters are transferred from the remit of the Directorate-General for Trade to that of the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, as is the case with agriculture, as we are also dealing here with products that are particularly sensitive, tuna being the classic case. On the subject of tuna, we have a scandalous example in the waiving of the rules of origin without the conditions being taken into account in the agreements with Papua New Guinea and Fiji, which only serves to favour our main competitors: Thailand and the Philippines. Commissioner, are you aware that, in addition to strangling the EU sector, thanks to your policy, Papua New Guinea is entering a phase of very low-quality job creation and zero sustainable development? Are you aware of the reports by non-governmental organisations operating in the region of child labour, insanitary conditions and lack of hygiene in factories, the disastrous environmental impact on the Madang coast and illegal fishing? Is it your responsibility to prevent this? Carmen Fraga Estévez,

Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work and on how easy he made it for all of us to work with him and produce a good report. We should be pleased because for the first time we are going to adopt a report on fisheries under the ordinary legislative procedure, at first reading and with the agreement of all three institutions. Parliament’s amendments were essentially aimed at incorporating the new recommendations that arose at the meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in 2009, as the Commission’s proposal only included the 2008 recommendations. They were also aimed at clarifying and specifying some definitions and technical specifications in order to ensure that the obligations of all operators and each of the Member States involved in bluefin tuna fishing were crystal clear. The aim is that the origin of all bluefin tuna that comes to EU markets can be identified so that if this cannot be verified its sale can be banned. As the rapporteur acknowledges in his report, we have therefore arrived at the most comprehensive documentation programme in existence for any species. This means that we can send a message of confidence, while acknowledging that the international organisation that governs the management of bluefin tuna is very capable of reacting for itself in terms of monitoring its status and responding to networks for the illegal fishing of a species whose trade has reached a level of complexity that surpasses that of any other species. Despite the criticisms, without the knowledge and experience acquired by ICCAT it is more than doubtful that any other organisation would be able to take the same type of measures as swiftly and with the same knowledge of the facts. We therefore trust that the entry into force of this regulation will not only help the recovery of the species and the fight against illegal fishing of that species, but also that it will help to reintroduce a minimum level of rationality and objectivity among the public, and especially within some non-governmental organisations. As the rapporteur said, the ball is back in ICCAT’s court, and I would like to add that it never should have left ICCAT’s court. I say this on behalf of my group. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE
).  
– (ES)
 Mr President, everything is at stake in this reform. If we are not courageous now, there will not be another opportunity to create a genuine fisheries policy and we will be partly responsible for its failure. The CFP has, for years, suffered increasingly justified criticism and it would be disheartening if, when we are being offered one last opportunity, this Parliament were to prove incapable of proposing alternatives to what we have criticised so many times, in particular, the obvious failure of the conservation and management system, as demonstrated by both the state of resources and the decline in the sector. I simply cannot understand any reluctance to clearly suggest alternatives, as discussed in this House in 1996, such as transferable quota systems or effort-based management, which have had such positive results and which could help to maintain the more industrial fleets at least. The report says that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution, but at the same time, it closes the door on the possibility that there might be other solutions. I do not understand the contradiction, nor do I understand why, if someone does not want to use an instrument, the solution must be to prohibit it for everyone. That is not protection of the weakest; it is fear on the part of some sectors that only see permanent subsidies as solutions. The CFP should also guarantee competitiveness in a globalised world of fisheries products. The market for these products will undoubtedly continue to grow but it seems that it will grow without us. The policies within the Union should be coherent and we must ensure that the trade policy and rules on origin, such as those that appeared in the new economic partnership agreements, do not destroy the competitiveness of Community fisheries without being anything other than mere gestures to third countries; otherwise, it is our fisheries sector that will suffer. Mr President, consensus is a good thing when it results in progress, but not when we remain motionless in the face of problems, and we have many problems to solve. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I would also like to talk about commercial fishing species, and I would like to make it very clear that regional fisheries organisations are already responsible for managing and conserving these species. In fact, one only has to skim through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to realise that it is perhaps designed for elephants and polar bears, but it is not, of course, designed for commercial fishing species. I am not against protecting bluefin tuna, as that would be absurd, if only because of its importance to the fleet. I do, however, think that the measures need to be decided by bodies that have the best specialists in both managing fisheries and scientific research, because there is a reason why the CITES has to take external advice when it receives proposals on these species. I therefore think that the proposal to include bluefin tuna in Appendix 1 of CITES is unnecessary and unjustified, because it already has the measures imposed by International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). It is unfair, because it would gratuitously damage a fleet that has just embarked on a huge drive to reduce fishing, and even counterproductive, because it could give rise to an uncontrollable black market in bluefin tuna. I understand the enormous pressure that public opinion in general and this House in particular – as we are seeing – is experiencing from environmental NGOs. My political group has therefore decided to support inclusion in Appendix II as a compromise between the proposal of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and those of us who think that fisheries management cannot be snatched away from regional fisheries organisations. Our proposal is indeed based on the scientific advice to CITES. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) has recommended that bluefin tuna only be included in Appendix II of CITES, which demonstrates that many people have not even read the FAO report. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE

 Madam President, while illegal fishing in the Indian Ocean may be occurring, the Community fleet can certainly not be described as illegal, as has been suggested here. The Community fleet fishes within the strictest bounds of legality, with licences issued under the European Community – Seychelles Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which regulates and manages tuna fishing in the area. Secondly, all Community vessels are equipped with a satellite monitoring system, through which they can be located in real time and at all times by the fishing and military authorities. Thirdly, the Community fleet has observers on board and complies with a strict regime of providing information on fishing activity through fishing logbooks, catch samples and a ban on transferring goods at high sea, among other measures. Lastly, the entire Community fleet has been duly entered in the IOTC regional fleet register. I personally would like both the Commission and the Council to acknowledge that the European fleet fishing in that area is doing so within the strictest bounds of legality. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.

Madam President, thank you very much to the rapporteur and to the Committee on Budgets for accepting all of the amendments from the Committee on Fisheries. What is particularly important for us is the amendment calling for greater flexibility in the funding granted to Regional Advisory Councils on fishing. As well as being scarce, the funding is so subject to interpretations and to the discretion of the Commission that the Councils are prevented from spending even the little that they have; this request was made to us unanimously by the seven existing councils. One amendment that we consider particularly opportune calls for a comprehensive strategy to combat piracy that genuinely considers the situation of fishing boats, which are particularly vulnerable to these acts in all the world's waters. With regard to research and the Seventh Framework Programme, as in previous years, we have demonstrated prudence and asked that, now that fisheries research no longer has its own heading in the budget, at least the percentage of investment should not decrease, as all decisions on fisheries management hinge on knowledge of the environment and of marine species, especially given that one of our new objectives is to apply an ecosystem-based approach to all legislation in the Common Fisheries Policy. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Seeber. I would like to express a series of basic ideas that I believe are important. Firstly, a market in water cannot exist without greater transparency and a very clear idea of, and an obligation for countries to determine, where the water originates. Transparent management must be in place, along with knowledge of the water in the aquifers and how it is distributed. This process has not been designed; it is not yet a political tool and needs to be developed, as does aquifer control using a digital system. I also believe it is necessary to control the issue of shale gas and its impact on aquifers. I find it utterly dangerous and perhaps careless, and I am aware of the Commissioner’s interest in monitoring the specific impact of shale gas on aquifers. I also believe that, when it comes to drought, we have too many diagnoses and very few solutions. Any directive should relate to the agricultural production system and include solutions. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, there is an issue that concerns me: the fact that water is not a renewable product for many. Water is sometimes renewable, but not always. Many aquifers are not renewable, but water returns to the ground. The problem is that it does not always return to the same place it comes out; for example, the water that evaporates from the Mediterranean forms the rain that falls over Austria or Prague, and that aspect needs to be taken into account. I think transboundary water agreements are very good, and I think that the Commission should place much greater emphasis on them. As the directive lays down, a river has to be managed in a uniform and unique way, but this approach needs to be strengthened a great deal, and international relationships with respect to transboundary waters need to be promoted. That is essential in my view, and we will see it with Turkey, which will never agree, but we must insist. However, I think the monitoring of aquifers is very poor. The technology exists to monitor aquifers. Most damage is done through illegal extraction of water from aquifers. I therefore think it is vital that this aspect is taken on board, and technology exists for that. I also believe that the relationship between agriculture and water should be reviewed, because it should not be the case that crops that consume a lot of water are treated in the same way as those that do not. If we put a price on water, which I support in agriculture, and which occurs in my country and region, it should be taken into account that corn and lettuce, for example, consume much more water. We are then exporting water to all the countries to which corn or lettuce are exported. That needs to be reflected in agricultural prices. It is an issue for consideration. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Madam President, I think that Ms Gardini’s report is very good and a great effort has been made. However, I would have liked it to have looked not only at prevention, but also at what will happen next. One of the extremely serious problems in Haiti, for example, in Lorca during the recent earthquake, and in L’Aquila, is precisely that, while lives have been saved and life has returned to normal, there is a need to rebuild cities, cities that took years and thousands of years to be built. They have to be rebuilt all of a sudden. They have to be built, and there is a science and technology to help with this. It is not possible to build on just any ground after an earthquake. It is important to find out which ground is the most suitable. Where is the special European Union unit to coordinate all the knowledge within all the sections? We are told that the new cities must be energy efficient, that they have to be smart cities, but how does one make the transition from a destroyed city to a smart city? In this area, Europe has abandoned its people. It has not put in place any coordination measures, and there is a need, Commissioner, to coordinate the reconstruction work and ensure true flood prevention. There is a need to look at how to control the rivers. Other countries, such as Spain, have achieved this to a large degree. One cannot stop talking about a disaster the day after it has happened. This is why I am much more concerned about what happens next, and I believe that this is where Europe must start to act. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Matias for her report. I would especially like to say a number of things to Ms Geoghegan-Quinn: firstly, do not disregard small projects. Silicon Valley was built on small projects. Europe needs a great many of these so that small universities may be brought on board. Secondly, I believe that what Europe needs is human resources. Large projects should be tied to a scholarship programme so that more grant holders can go to large universities and institutes to receive training. I think both the Structural Funds and this system should pay less attention to buildings – Europe has a plentiful supply of buildings but is indeed lacking in human resources. I also believe, Commissioner, that you will find you have the full support of Parliament if Member States are also required, through the European Research Area (ERA), to simplify their procedures. Europe’s efforts at simplification should be met with transparent procedures on the part of the Member States, which will have to commit themselves, given that they will be receiving money. Commissioner, you will have Parliament’s full support if we aim to achieve simple, transparent Council procedures. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines,

 Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude for the work done in this report. However, I have to say that an agreement between the political groups has not been reached. This is a very significant report because it breaks the unity of environmental policy that has always existed in Europe. The break is a result of requests to which the Commission, of course, has rightfully replied. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is not totally united either. However, we have reached some basic agreements in which we understand, firstly, that the legal pillar cannot be changed as it puts the internal market in danger. The internal market is one of the most important values that we have achieved. It safeguards agriculture and our negotiations before the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Therefore, we want a report that, within the uncertainty it creates, is well-founded on an adequate legal construct. Secondly, we seek to strengthen the scientific nature of decisions. We have a large body, the European Food Safety Authority, which we cannot weaken by returning to taking decisions only from the criteria of national authorities. Therefore, we support the fact that decisions should be taken on a case by case basis, that they should not be subjective, and that we should also bear in mind we are now subject to grand populist policies and media pressure that can often make us lose sight of clear and objective scientific values. Finally, we want to say that is necessary to safeguard agriculture in Europe. It is necessary to strengthen Europe. I want to add something more: certain forms of nationalism are the greatest and most dangerous form of euroscepticism. I believe democracies based on national parliaments have been talked about here, and we must take into account that the joint European policy is also democracy and it has produced a major environmental policy. Therefore, the Group of the European People’s Party officially supports the report although there are groups, such as the Spanish delegation, that think differently. It is obviously going to support the Commission’s Dalli report but it is not going to support the Lepage report if our amendments are not adopted. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Mr President, thank you very much for your compassionate and supportive words. The Lorca tragedy is becoming clear. At the moment, we know that eight people have died, among them two pregnant women and a twelve year-old boy, more than 250 have been injured and 80% of houses are affected. That is to say, from now on and for the moment, many Lorca citizens will be homeless. A large portion of Lorca citizens have also lost their places of work and with them have gone their hopes, expectations and opportunities. Lorca is a city of 70 000 inhabitants, of whom 20% are immigrants that the city has received, taken in and been able to give a new life with new meaning. I know that together, the old and new residents of Lorca, with help from the institutions and from everybody, will be able to begin a new journey in their lives. I also have to say and call on the European Union not to leave anyone behind and to be able to help those affected, recognise their pain and stand by their side, opening their arms and offering opportunities. I would like to thank you all very much and to ask for a minute’s silence. (Applause) Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 Mr President, I must thank all my fellow Members who have understood the problem of the Mediterranean region, the Spanish delegation, and all those who understand that we in the Canary Islands, Murcia, Valencia and Almeria, in addition to being frustrated at the Commission’s failure to honour its agreements, and to having seen many companies forced out of business, remain the entry point for immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, the entry point for Moroccan immigrants, and a buffer against the crisis. This is because we are currently supporting, at a time of utter economic penury, people who come to work and are able to send money home to their families. Therefore, I believe that the Commission must also behave responsibly with regard to the competences granted to it by the Treaties. I believe the Commission has not given any thought to the need to defend the interests of the public, or to the need to prevent an indiscriminate policy which, moreover, makes us import produce grown in extremely dubious phytosanitary conditions. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to celebrate the fact that there is innovation, attention to innovation, and also partnership, but I would also like to say that we do not know what this thing is that we are talking about. We are talking about an initiative, but no one has told us about its content, its formula or its model. I would suggest that, first of all, if we want to be efficient, as some fellow Members in this House have said, we review the results of what has happened with the Institutes for European Training and Information (IETIs), the partnerships and the platforms. Now that we have had experience with the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, we need to evaluate these things objectively, with external evaluation, looking at the results. In the cases of some IETIs, for example, we have seen that they have ended up being dominated by large companies, and once again, small businesses have been left out. I would suggest that there be policies and formulas for innovation to see how we can help small businesses to get involved, perhaps sometimes through intermediary bodies that help them to pay for the projects or to carry them out. We cannot, however, carry on this way, leaving small businesses out. Secondly, we need to consider the need for innovation in administration, in other words, innovation in the management of innovation. This is because the market guides innovation, and administration is not used to following the market, which works much faster. We therefore need to do much more capacity building, innovate in capacity building and innovate in administration for research, in order to manage research and help businesses to get to work on this very difficult and complex undertaking for the future. Of course, we also need to incorporate the banking system in terms of the risks involved, which should not only be undertaken by the European people. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Mr President, I think that in the Year of Biodiversity, we have talked a great deal about the disaster that is happening, but very little about solutions. I think that society needs solutions and new ways of approaching the problem. Firstly, the division of Europe into bio-geographical areas should be translated into a specific policy because the problems in the different areas of Europe are not the same. We should therefore have a micro-policy on biodiversity, because biodiversity is a local issue. Secondly, it is terrible that we should be turning our back on all action regarding soil and the abandonment of agricultural soil when the trophic cycles of animals require a detailed study of each area. This has not been done. It is not well known that in many areas, by planting certain trees, there will be more birds and by planting certain plants, there will also be more insects. Experts acknowledge that the lack of insects is the great tragedy of the loss of biodiversity, especially with regard to birds. Nothing is being said about the problems with soil, insects and the organic richness of soil. It appears to be a crime to talk about soil in Europe. Finally, I would like to say that the landowners are essential. An amendment on stakeholders that I tabled in committee was rejected. However, if we have birds or animals, will the farmers who plant the plants that they come to eat not have something to say? Will the owner of their habitat not have something to say? Will farmers not have something to say? I think that this method of imposing ideological dictatorships needs to come to an end in Europe if we want to achieve better biodiversity.

Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the pupils of the European Schools, whose qualifications are not recognised by the Spanish Ministry for Education. They are nearly all children of Spanish officials, and are being discriminated against and treated unfairly. The equivalence table that is being used, which was recently consolidated by the Spanish Ministry, deducts half a point or one point from pupils who have studied at the European Schools. Moreover, these are boys and girls who speak languages. This means that when they try to apply for degrees that have a high cut-off mark, they remain outside the system. We believe that this is inherently unjust.
 Firstly, because Spain signed all the agreements and conventions and is not keeping to them. Secondly, because it is basic discrimination. A country cannot go on purporting to be European when really it is treating pupils from our European Schools unfairly and discriminating against them. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 I would like to welcome Mrs Espinosa; I am very pleased that she is here. I am most concerned by the change in attitude, and the fact that our analysis of Copenhagen may well lead to a change in attitude. Firstly, I think that one of our problems is a lack of humility and realism, as my colleagues have already said. Above all, however, I am concerned that, when we have been to other countries, we have found that they do not talk about climate change but rather global change. The context in which we will be moving in Mexico, and the context in which we have been moving, is that of a growing population, a food shortage, a need for more agriculture, and limited land and water resources; therefore, any decision we take on climate change must be considered within that context. Of course, we must also remember that many countries have a right to develop. We thus need to take a systemic view, something that is lacking in our analysis of climate change. Climate change cannot be resolved on the issue of emissions alone. A sectoral, quantitative vision does not lead anywhere. What is more, we have to attach greater importance to science. In particular, I ask the Commission that those teams who tampered with data be checked and have their funding withdrawn, if the European Union is indeed supporting them, because this will discredit us forever. How are we going to coordinate on this matter? That is another very important question. How is the European Union going to organise itself in order to reach an agreement? We should have already started working on that this morning. Finally, the issue that concerns me: adaptation is carried out in the territory concerned, and we have to begin that process, once again, with a new, strategic vision of the territory; this includes productivity, strategic reforestation, regions, areas and districts devoted to agro-energy and, of course, water and biodiversity. We are lacking that vision. On this point, I think we need to think about the option of Structural Funds for new strategic plans in all regions in order to be able to carry out this adaptation; and decision makers should be invited to begin that strategic revision of the territory because we do not have responsibility for that area and it will be very difficult to work on it from Europe. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, it concerns me that frequently a lack of coordination means that sustainability criteria are not applied to agriculture. I would like to ask two questions: firstly, at a time when we are experiencing desertification in southern Europe, which is seriously impacted by climate change, and given that land use is the most important thing, why is money being paid to pull up olive trees and vines? This means that Europe is paying to have more desert! Are you going to stop this? Secondly, the agreement with Morocco: if Europe is conducting a common foreign policy, it must defend the interests of its citizens and of European production. Europe is negotiating the agreement with Morocco on its knees, without taking into account the principle of reciprocity, without guaranteeing health and that insecticide and food quality programmes will be maintained. How is it possible that this process is not only opening the door to products on top of the quotas, but that it is also putting quality at risk? Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I am going to talk about two concepts, namely coordination and flexibility. A problem has been found with all the matters that were discussed in the Council. In recent years, there has been an extraordinary lack of coordination between the different Directorates-General in the Commission. Climate change policy has frequently been considered independently of the scientific knowledge of the Directorate-General for Research. It has also been conducted independently of land use, for example, which is linked to climate change. My first question is as follows. Are you prepared to organise and strengthen internal coordination, in such a way that, when we appoint our commissioners, we can be assured that internal coordination is guaranteed? My second question relates to the fact that we are talking about competitiveness, about an economic crisis. Is the Commission also prepared to be more flexible on some matters such as REACH and its implementation, which is going to cause extraordinary damage to our own competitiveness? Is it prepared to be more flexible? My last idea on this coherence policy is that we cannot talk about the economy and recovery without talking about opening up the energy markets. There are countries that do not have an energy market, such as Spain in the case of gas. This means that prices rise and development becomes impossible. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

Mr President, the rapporteur, Ms García Pérez, should be congratulated on her work and on the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council of Ministers. It is shame that the Council is not represented here tonight with us. The new quality system for agricultural products is a simplification of the current system and a streamlining of current authorisation procedures, and that is good news. It is also a good achievement to have included the obligation to use the Union logo for designations of origin and protected geographical indications, given that it increases the exposure of European products. I think it is also worth noting that the provisions for protecting quality designations in bilateral agreements with third countries are strengthened, and that a legal basis for defending the European Union logo in those third countries is created, as I honestly think that the protection of European products in third countries should be a fundamental objective. It is a shame that this package has been somewhat stripped back during the negotiations and, I will say it again, it is a shame that the Council is not here to hear it, because the original quality package proposed by the Commission has been rather forgotten and the marketing standards and management of supply through quality designations of origin have been cut from the agreement, leaving it, as I said, a little empty. I think the Council’s blinkered attitude on these two issues is regrettable, as they refused to listen to Parliament’s reasonable positions. Supply management by means of designations of origin should have been defended, and will of course be defended in the single common market organisation. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, through the assistance of the European Union, food banks have been carrying out notable and recognised social work, which must continue in the future with the full support of Parliament. Solidarity and social and territorial cohesion is precisely one of the fundamental ideas behind European integration. The existence of a programme such as this is therefore vital in order to help achieve this. The current economic crisis is hitting European citizens hard. Eighty million people are below the poverty line and 43 million people have to weigh up whether to include protein in their diet twice a week. We can use the European Union budget to make a cohesive effort, which includes the common agricultural policy item. Ladies and gentlemen, as Members of this Parliament, we must encourage any initiatives to continue the food aid programme in 2014, and throughout the coming financial perspective period. The European Parliament has to forge an agreement with the Council and avoid selfishness at all costs in favour of European citizens. Esther Herranz García  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, apart from the 80 million poor people we are talking about, a further 43 million people find it hard to manage to eat animal protein twice a week. This situation could become worse because these people  – the ones who have problems managing to eat animal protein twice a week – could find themselves in dire straits, as the economic crisis is becoming even more acute. This is not exactly the best time for the European Union to be cutting the food aid budget in the run-up to the next multi-annual financial framework period. The agreement, endorsed by Parliament, extends food aid under the conditions requested by this Chamber. It also represents, however, a certain level of resignation towards the block that some Member States have kept up for several months in the Council. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to urge all of you here to take whatever initiatives are necessary to keep food aid going beyond 2014. Parliament should not stand idly by in the face of such an important humanitarian issue. We should not accept the status quo, and this means we should use the negotiations for the next multi-annual financial framework period to express our opinion on this issue, and to push for an agreement between the Council of Ministers and Parliament to ensure that aid for the poorest can be maintained beyond that date. Food banks have been able to provide a noteworthy social service thanks to European aid, and this should not be paralysed through the selfishness of some governments. This service has benefited 13 million people, which has enabled us, with minimal effort, to make the common agricultural policy a bit more important. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, last year Parliament’s Committee on Petitions asked the European Commission to amend the entry price system for fruit and vegetables entering the Union. This system allows products from third countries to enter fraudulently, as the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) itself has stated. These products are primarily Moroccan tomatoes. The Governments of Spain, France and Italy issued a statement last year that made the same request. We can combat this fraud by amending the Regulation on application of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for agricultural products, because the problem will not be resolved by aligning the Customs Code, Commissioner. For several years I have been speaking up within the Spanish Partido Popular
 about the need to stop new concessions to Morocco until such time as the European Union has the necessary instruments in place to ensure compliance with the agreement currently in force. The European Commission argues that the Member States should control imports. However, what the Commission does not say is that the current entry price system prevents national customs authorities from being able to properly trace the prices declared by importers in order to check for irregularities. Amend the Regulation on the application of the CMO for agricultural products and part of the problem will be solved. If you do not, the legal loophole in European legislation will prevent national authorities from doing their jobs properly. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to thank my colleague, Ms Patrão Neves, because, during the last few months, she has defended against all opposition this resolution which we are debating today and which we will vote on later. Ms Patrão Neves, with the support of the Group of the European People’s Party, has had to face many obstacles and I should like to congratulate her on the work which has brought us to this point. Ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, farmers received 50% of the final price paid by consumers; but today, in many cases, they receive less than 10%. At the same time, in 20 years, the market share for distribution chains has risen from 21.7% to 70%. Something is going on, and it is quite obvious. Measures must be adopted to ensure that food supply chains are more equitable, more equal and fairer. Firstly, the security networks provided by the common agricultural policy to ensure fair prices must be improved. We need an EU framework to guarantee fair relationships and avoid abuse. We must define and prohibit abusive practices within these margins. We must make production more concentrated, encouraging producers’, farmers’ and livestock breeders’ organisations. We must also ensure fair competition conditions for all producers with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities. I am referring to those producers outside of the European Union who do not meet the same standards in terms of quality, food security, animal welfare and all these issues which are so essential that we require our producers to meet such standards. Where do we do all of this? Well, in the next CAP reform, of course. We must improve contractual relations in this CAP reform. The aim will be to improve the position of the primary sector within the chain, improve distribution trade policy, avoid the constant increase in food speculation, take into account and improve those margins which are causing a rise in non-agricultural costs, and, finally, assure producers that all products on the EU market meet the same quality standards. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, I am glad that you are here with us this morning, and I hope that today you will answer me a little more seriously and a little more clearly. In the proposed reform of the common agricultural policy that you presented to us on 12 October, you spoke of eliminating the sugar quota system, and you also spoke about ending vine-planting rights. Parliament, which has recently voted on the report by Mr Dess, is in favour of continuing planting rights beyond 2015 and not liberalising them. It also wants to maintain the sugar quota system until at least 2020. Are you going to support Parliament’s position and Parliament’s decision on these two issues? Esther Herranz García  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 If I have understood you correctly, Commissioner, given that there are now 15 Member States in the Council that think differently, as they did before, and given that Parliament is continuing its commitment to vine-planting rights, does this mean we can be relatively optimistic about the Commission’s proposal next year in the wine report? Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 – (ES)
 Mr President, this morning the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, brought this subject up in the debate on the state of the Union. That gives us an idea of the importance the Commission affords this issue. He spoke about hope, inclusion and solidarity. At a time of economic crisis such as this, when there are ever more unemployed people, and ever more people living close to the poverty line, this deadlock shown by some Member States is the most absolute example of a lack of solidarity. Those countries that are opposed, the richest of the European Union, may endanger the continuation of a programme that, with 1% of the common agricultural policy budget, helps 18 million people. The Commissioner is right to shame those Council members who are incapable of showing solidarity at this time. I urge the Polish Presidency, between now and the end of its term, to continue with its support in order to move forward with this programme. It deserves that. So do all the people who need it, and the EU also deserves that vote of confidence and, above all, that response to its citizens. The EU Council of Ministers should take into account Parliament’s view that the programme should not only be maintained but also improved, as this House called for yesterday. I would also like to remind the Heads of State or Government that we hope and trust that at the next summit they will take these matters seriously and find a political way out of this deadlock. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, though today’s debate focuses on this important report on the reform of the common agricultural policy, I should like to comment on a side issue that affects us and could affect the viability of the postulates we are defending in Parliament in connection with the reform of the future of the CAP. Next week, the European Commission will present its proposal on the financial prospects for the post-2014 period, in which, if my information proves correct, the Community executive is decidedly intent on proposing cuts to the EU agricultural budget. It must therefore be borne in mind that the European Commission will not take on board the opinion that we will adopt tomorrow, in which we specifically request the expenditure of the common agricultural policy to be maintained. I fail to see how, with a reduced budget, we will be able to rise to all the challenges described in that document; how common agricultural policy subsidies will be made greener, a process we want to ensure will not require an additional effort on the part of agricultural and livestock farmers; how we will be able to achieve this. I fail to see how, with a diminished CAP, we will be able to respond – just to give another example – to price volatility, and establish a budget line, as is our intention, that will rise to the crisis we have come to know so well. The CAP should not be measured merely in terms of expenditure because, in addition to the goods and services it provides, I believe it should be made clear – today of all days – that EUR 1 invested in agriculture generates EUR 10 of wealth in the agri-food sector. This should be very much taken into account when it comes to setting the next budgetary framework. Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that negotiations with third countries and with the World Trade Organisation pose a serious threat to the future of agricultural and livestock production in the European Union. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, one can only express a deep sense of sorrow for the 23 fatalities: 22 in Germany and one in Sweden. This crisis is clear evidence that the European Union has a long way to go in improving its food safety alert system and its internal coordination. The Member States involved have been slow, inefficient and inoperative in their reaction, and, at this point in time, with 23 people dead, we still do not know where the problem is coming from. The European Commission must think hard about the problems it causes with its irresponsible actions or its failure to act at times of crisis such as we are seeing now. These lead to cases of financial ruin, the destruction of previously stable jobs, unemployment, helplessness and, needless to say, an extremely hazardous public health crisis. While you in the Commission paid heed to irresponsible statements issued by regional authorities in Germany – statements that were totally misinformed and quite irresponsible – mentioning Spanish farms by their names and addresses, the population remained exposed, without knowing it, to the bacterium. Thus, in the belief that they were avoiding contact with it, the public were more exposed than ever to eating potentially harmful food. In the Council of Agriculture Ministers that will be held in Luxembourg at two o’clock this afternoon, the European Commission should propose that a portion of the EUR 2 500 million left over from the common agricultural policy be put to use. Those EUR 2 500 million should be used to redress, in so far as is possible, the damage that has been caused. To enable this, a suitable legal solution will need to be found, as was the case in previous instances, for example, the ‘mad cow’ and dioxin affairs. One such solution should also be found now. Commissioners, Ministers, your actions in Luxembourg today must befit the stature of your office. Furthermore, the German authorities, in view of their reckless accusations, should definitely support this financial solution from the very beginning, and use funds of their own to conduct communication campaigns aimed at restoring consumer confidence in horticultural products, which is now in shatters. Esther Herranz García,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I would firstly like to express my gratitude to the Committee on Petitions for its hard work following the complaint brought by the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants, based on the report published by OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, in 2007. I believe this report’s conclusions are extremely clear and justify only too well action on the part of the European Commission – which should have addressed this matter a long time ago – to clarify the operation of the entry price regime, at least in relation to the tomato sector. However, not only having failed to take any action to prevent the different types of fraud made possible by the current Entry Price Regulation, the Commission has negotiated a new agriculture agreement with Morocco without having first resolved the shortcomings of the import regime currently in place. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the European Commission to take its responsibilities seriously, to start investigating where and how fraud is being committed, and, potentially, to demand payment of any unpaid customs duties. I believe that there is no way that a new agreement with Morocco should be ratified until all the details we have set out are resolved. Our aim is not to hinder new international agreements, but to ensure that such agreements will not seriously damage the interests of European producers, and that the rules laid down in those agreements will be adhered to. Where the new agreement with Morocco is concerned, all the European fruit and vegetables sector is demanding is a guarantee that the terms agreed will, in fact, be observed. This will only be made possible by reforming the entry price regime. We cannot have a new agreement with Morocco until we have a new system for entry prices. We will not be able to ratify the agreement that the Commission has already concluded. Moreover, if this supervisory role is to be played by the Member States, they should be required to make a significant financial contribution. However, it is also true that we have long been calling for a European borders and customs system similar to that of the United States, so as to ensure effective control. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

Mr President, in January 2012, 400 Spanish egg producers could disappear, which is around 30% of the total number in my country, with the loss of the production of 300 000 tonnes of eggs. The European Union could stop producing the 80 million eggs, which amount to 2 million tonnes, and if we do not act very intelligently, the only thing that we would achieve would be that they would be covered by imports from third countries, whose animal welfare standards are much lower than those in the European Union. This 1999 directive, which requires that the space in cages for laying hens be increased, demands that we act intelligently and positively, because otherwise, we will only weaken European production and give extra trade opportunities to third countries where the amount of space per bird is much smaller than what we currently have in the European Union. This directive requires a great deal of effort from European producers, as in Spain alone, it is understood that the cost is around EUR 600 million. It should also not be forgotten that it has an economic impact that extends to the egg products industry and the food industry in general. I therefore ask for your support for the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to paragraph 2, which asks for a solution to be found at least for responsible farms and responsible businesses that are in the process of transforming their farms and will have completed that transformation by January 2012. We need to support them in transforming their facilities and give them time to complete that process, thus preventing farms from suffering irreparable damage and preventing an overnight shortage in the EU market, which will consequently increase prices for consumers. We need to respect the directive, give the egg and egg products industries a chance and also respect the right to animal welfare and the right of consumers to a reasonable price.

Commissioner, thank you very much for being here and for having shown so much sensitivity regarding this very important parliamentary initiative that is so necessary for the European livestock sector. The sector is particularly vulnerable to the crises affecting EU agriculture as a whole, due to multiple factors: the high costs of inputs, the fall in market prices, imbalances of power in the food chain and the current increase in cereal prices. The European livestock industry has to deal with these problems just like other agricultural sectors, but with an aggravating factor: the large investments that are particular to this type of production. As the European Commission is on the verge of presenting its communication on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), I think this is a very good time to send a message of solidarity and concern to this group of producers. In my country, Spain, as in other EU countries, we are talking about a structural crisis, and the cereal price rises have just aggravated a situation that has been dragging on for several years now. The statistics show that a growing number of farms are being abandoned. However, this should not be the case in the context of global demand that will grow in the next few years thanks to the supposed improvement in people’s standard of living. With a view to the forthcoming CAP reform, what measures is the Commissioner, or the European Commission, planning, taking into account the specific nature of the livestock sector? I am talking about market measures, and other initiatives to prevent the models of intensive production that respect EU environmental standards being penalised by the future aid system, among other detrimental effects. Common-sense measures should be implemented that guarantee greater security of supply of livestock feed, the establishment of sufficient cereal reserves and the speeding up of the release of those reserves. Finally, to conclude, I would like to welcome the fact that this motion for a resolution makes special mention of pork and poultry, sectors that do not receive direct EU aid, but for which market and trade measures could also be established to alleviate their situation.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Cioloş that this report is essential and comes at the right time because it has demonstrated the abuses committed by mass distribution, severely disrupting the various links in the food chain. While the Bové report may go too far on some points by seeking to be too interventionist, it must be acknowledged that from the point of view of the social market economy that we advocate in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), it provides responses to the justified complaints made by European producers. It also brings transparency to the different parts of the food chain, which is always a good thing, offers the weakest sectors in the chain much more opportunities to defend themselves and, of course, supports European consumers in becoming more informed about that food chain. The European food industry could perhaps have been taken into account to a greater extent in this report, which would have been a good thing, but the report does also include measures for curbing the volatility of prices, which was very necessary. It also sets out measures for achieving equality between the links in the chain, as requested by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and it also asks for abusive and unfair practices in mass distribution to be combated. The time is now coming to establish a list of abusive practices to be strictly banned by European legislation. It is also important that measures be set out for preventing difficult practices through private labels that go against competition and intellectual property law. For all these reasons, we should support the Bové report, and all our fellow Members in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, who have worked hard to ensure that this report was finally published to help European producers move forwards.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the next few months we will be entering into a full debate on the new common agricultural policy (CAP). It is important to reach a satisfactory agreement, and so I hope that the Belgian Presidency manages to achieve what the Spanish Presidency did not. I hope that the Belgian Presidency can direct discussions in such a way that the Member States commit themselves to maintaining a truly strong CAP in the future, with a sufficient budget for meeting the needs of the 27 Member States, both new and old; I also hope that it will not be as it was in 2005, when there was a lack of money and a modulation had to be improvised. In the upcoming reform of the CAP, we are gambling with the viability of a sector that not only provides intangible goods and services, such as care for the environment, but must also guarantee the supply of food to the European public. We have witnessed distressing shortage situations in the past, which is why the European Parliament should make security of supply based on EU production the main objective of the next reform, without leaving aside other contributions, such as the fight against climate change.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Madam President, to be honest, the first thing I wanted to do this evening is to thank Mr Scottà for his excellent skill in negotiating this report. It has been a real pleasure working with him and with the other spokespeople for the parliamentary groups. We are proud of the position that will be demonstrated tomorrow in the vote in Parliament and on a report such as this, which defends quality and which commits to the development and enhancement of rural areas, not only as mere evidence of a traditional European culture, but as true wealth- and job-creation agents. These are jobs that we currently need so much at this time of economic crisis and such a dramatic situation in terms of levels of employment in some Member States. In addition, we are pleased with the protection maintained by Parliament and the position already maintained by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as it has made clear, in committing to quality of the highest standard. With regard to that highest standard, moreover, we naturally commit to maintaining that differentiation between Protected Designation of Origin and Protected Geographical Indication. Of course, we reject ideas of levelling quality downwards and we want EU production to receive attention and be valued. I am delighted at what Mr Cioloş had to say. It was, of course, pleasing to hear him speak about commitment to the future of the European farming environment. We naturally hope he will listen to Parliament’s voice, which will be reflected tomorrow in the vote. Finally, I would like to say let us hope that it never happens again that the European Commission gets ahead of Parliament by prohibiting things such as, for example, marketing standards for fruit and vegetables, that have caused such damage to European free competition. We want the imbalances in the market corrected and we also want to commit to quality, variety, food safety and the right quantity of production. In addition, we want EU production and the quality of that EU agricultural and food production to be defended in the World Trade Organisation. We are, of course, also relying on the work of Mr Cioloş for that, because neither our European producers nor our European consumers can go on being defenceless. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs McGuinness on this initiative, which demonstrates the important role that the common agricultural policy (CAP) plays in meeting food provision needs internationally. Now that the European Commission seems to want to reduce the burden of the CAP on the Community budget, it is important to stress that while the CAP may not be a priority, food sufficiency must be. In past decades, it has been clear that without the CAP, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve food sufficiency. Agriculture cannot, therefore, be compared with other sectors of the economy which are able to thrive in a free market, because the food market is not a free market. Farmers need the support of the European Union in order for their businesses to succeed, and the European Union, in turn, needs farmers in order to maintain an agricultural model that is capable of providing sufficient food of sufficient quality to its increasingly demanding citizens. I therefore believe that we must change the course of the CAP, but not abolish it. In order to do this, direct aid must be guaranteed to farmers and a policy of managing agricultural markets must be restored to bring about greater price stability, which would benefit not only farmers but also consumers and third countries. A framework of best practices should be established in order to encourage balanced relations between the different players in the food chain, avoiding abusive practices and promoting fairer distribution of commercial margins. In addition, a European consumer information policy that highlights efforts by Community producers to comply with European Union regulations in the areas of the environment, food security and animal welfare is needed, since Community producers have to compete with imports from third countries, where the standards applied are much lower. Third-country producers prefer to export to the European Union rather than supplying their own countries’ markets because such exports are more profitable under World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements. Esther Herranz García,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, the European Union imposes on Community producers the highest standards in the world in terms of food security, health, animal welfare and the environment. European stockbreeders are obliged to meet these standards as a prerequisite for receiving European Union support. For the vast majority, this support does not offset the increased burden, and farms are being abandoned at an alarming rate. This process will continue unless adequate measures are taken. Let us, however, examine the issue more closely. The growing deficit in European production is naturally being covered by imports from third countries, mainly from Brazil. Given the pressure on Community stockbreeders, it would be totally dishonest to allow consignments of meat to enter the Community market if they failed to meet the minimum requirements agreed by the European Union with third countries. I would also like to highlight the fact that these requirements are lower that those imposed on our own farmers, because it would seem that imposing exactly the same standards on third-country imports would go against World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Given that the WTO prevents us from imposing the same standards on imports as we do on European stockbreeders, however, the Commission must, at the very least, guarantee that all meat that crosses Community borders comes from farms that have undergone adequate inspections. It would make no sense to block imports from countries like Brazil, since there is a Community demand which must be met. Nonetheless, this does not justify closing our eyes and looking the other way in the face of any irregularities that the European Union’s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) might detect during its regular inspections. I would like to know why the Commission is so keen to downplay these irregularities given that the FVO, on its last mission to Brazil, confirmed that some certification authorities do not meet the necessary inspection standards. The FVO also found huge flaws in the traceability system used by Brazil and detected problems with many consignments in transit to the European Union that did not have the necessary certificates. In view of this information, how can it be guaranteed that the 1 500 Brazilian farms do fulfil the agreed requirements? Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, you ended your speech by saying that there is a crisis in the milk sector, and yet you started by saying that all possible measures have already been taken and that the situation is being sorted out. You should know that it takes a wise woman to recognise that she was wrong. That is a saying in Spain, which could very well be applied to this situation. For months the milk sector has been suffering one of the worst crises in its history. Despite that, because the European Commission and certain governments – seemingly including my own, the Spanish Government – do not want to allow their arms to be twisted, they are refusing to go back on the decisions relating to the health check of the common agricultural policy. Those decisions were taken without any thought for the fragility of this sector, and in a market context very different from the one that has developed since that compromise was agreed. It makes you think that the Member States did not want to see, or could not see, at that time, the storm that was approaching. The reform has very quickly become irrelevant, due to the major turnaround in the market, which demonstrates that the sector is totally at the mercy of price volatility. The fact that major producers such as France and Germany – countries which, in absolute terms, obtained the biggest increase in their national production quotas in this agreement – are now the ones asking for a review of the health check decisions raises a lot of issues. As I see it, the Member States were wrong and should have listened more carefully to the voices, including mine, which were calling for any final decision on the future of the sector to be postponed until 2011. It is a shame that no one listened to us. Perhaps you should do so now. Eva Ortiz Vilella  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the President of the Court of Auditors for his presentation and the Commissioner for his statement.  The figures show that a number of issues need to be examined and we all – Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control, the President of the Court of Auditors and the Commission – need to attend very carefully to our own areas of responsibility, to ensure that we always achieve the best possible results.  Furthermore, the Member States have a very important role to play and must take on a task that, in my opinion, is vital if we are to succeed in ensuring that the results achieved and the image we convey when allocating funds are as good as they can possibly be. It is all the more important that money is spent soundly since that is why we are all here. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, in the last decade, one of the Union’s greatest successes has undoubtedly been the enlargement process. There is a series of principles that must govern, or must continue to govern, that process. I am referring to consolidation, conditionality and communication with the citizens. Another important prerequisite is the EU’s integration capacity. Does this principle still apply, as Ms Koppa’s report rightly suggests? Will we have resources in the future to finance the common policies or cohesion? I ask this because far-reaching cuts are being proposed for the new financial perspective, precisely in the funds for those policies, and others, too. Is that the European Union that we want in the future? Is that the way to prepare for future enlargements? Paradoxically, sometimes the greatest defenders of enlargement are those who most want to reduce the EU budget. We are also seeing the difficulty of having 27 Member States when taking decisions to tackle the serious crisis and strengthen the economic and monetary union. Sometimes, it takes a great deal of time to apply political decisions and that does not set a good example for future enlargements. It is possible that some of our own citizens cannot understand either how the European Union, with so many difficulties, will be able to cope with new enlargement challenges. I would add a small point: I am very pleased that the Koppa report incorporates the idea of creating a specific curricular element on the Union in secondary schools. It is the best way for young generations to find out about the Union and learn more about the enlargement process. My last point is that I cannot support the removal of the footnote from paragraph 28; it is the same formulation as that used by the Council and the Commission. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, given that foreign and security policy is such a broad subject, I shall focus on three basic ideas. Firstly, the EU’s external action should be ambitious. I want the European Union to be a major player in a global, complex, increasingly multipolar world, and it is also possible that we shall soon see something of a withdrawal in the external action of the United States. Secondly, size counts in foreign policy; as Europeans, we are stronger together than apart, and this ambitious perspective for Europe is reflected in Mr Brok’s solid report, which we shall adopt tomorrow. Thirdly, the Treaty of Lisbon provided new tools for this policy. I am referring to the position you hold, Baroness Ashton, as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Vice-President of the Commission. As you also chair the Foreign Affairs Council, it will now be easier to achieve unity, continuity and consistency in the Union’s foreign policy. In addition, you have a new instrument, the European External Action Service, into which diplomats from Member States have been incorporated, who will use their experience in foreign policy to enrich a vision that is more focused on issues related to economics, trade and cooperation by officials from the Commission. Finally, a true EU foreign policy not only takes time but also needs two basic conditions to be met: the new bodies of the Treaty of Lisbon should be ambitious, working with the purpose of leading the 27 Member States, not just accompanying them or finding lowest common denominators; secondly, the Member States should be aware of the need to work together on foreign policy, acting in a spirit of compromise and taking a constructive approach.

Mr President, I welcome the fact that the recent presidential elections in Egypt took place without any major problems and that the results have been accepted, but I think it is clear that those elections and the unexpected decisions taken by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces a few days before demonstrate that, in reality, there is a dual power structure in Egypt. These are delicate times. I believe it is essential that these two centres of power have dialogue and cooperate during this phase and launch an ordered transition towards normal democracy. I welcome the fact that it appears that the government soon to be elected by President Morsi will be a broad government representing broad sectors of the plural society that Egypt has. It will also be important to draw up a new constitution. I trust that it will establish a multi-party democratic system that respects human rights, including the rights of minorities. We cannot forget, as other speakers have said, the importance of the Christian minority, whose rights must be fully respected without discrimination. Egypt, ladies and gentlemen, is a key country in the Arab world and the whole region. What happens there will have repercussions on the rest of the Muslim world. Egypt can set an example, as Mr Pöttering said. It is also very important for the Egyptian political leaders to be aware of the need for their decisions not to destabilise the region, which has suffered numerous conflicts. I welcome the fact that the current international commitments are going to be honoured. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union cannot be removed from what is happening in Egypt. I repeat, it is a very important country, in our Mediterranean neighbourhood. We must support this transition and try to help where we can, without, of course, failing to defend our values and interests. Finally, I would like to express my support for the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which has been suffering a difficult situation in Egypt for months. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, this is a time of significant change in the Middle East. I will briefly discuss three points: Changes are afoot in Egypt with the forthcoming presidential elections. I would like them to be clean, to take place without incident, and for the parties and society to accept the results. I would certainly have liked the Egyptian authorities to have invited European observers. Egypt is a key country in the Arab world. It is important for a multi-party system to be consolidated there in which the prosperity and freedoms of the Egyptian people are the main objective. Living together in tolerance, rather than radicalism or polarisation, will allow all Egyptians to exercise freedoms, including religious freedom. What are your hopes, Baroness Ashton, for these elections? In Israel, I would like the broader base of the new government to favour the opening of negotiations with the Palestinians, but I am sceptical about the launching of negotiations this year due to the continuing problem of the settlements, which you referred to along with the regional and international context, including the electoral outlook in the United States. Another reason I am sceptical is the way that Israel is focusing on the Iranian nuclear programme. However, I do not think that the deadlock is helping anyone. I do not think that the changes that have taken place in the region are going to provide Israel with a more favourable context in future for resuming the negotiations. I will end by discussing Syria. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, things are not improving there, as has already been stated. Kofi Annan’s plan is not succeeding. The violence is only increasing, and is even seriously affecting children, and Kofi Annan’s plan is not supporting the opposition. I am afraid that President al-Assad’s government thinks that it can crush the revolution by force, and that in the end, the international community will accept it. It is essential that Russia and China place more pressure on the Syrian authorities to change their attitude. I would like you to tell us, Baroness Ashton, whether, at the recent summit with Russia at the weekend, you were able to glean whether there is any desire in Moscow to adjust its position. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, the consolidation of democracy, human rights and the rule of law is particularly important in our neighbourhood – taken from Article 8 of the Treaty on European Union – and Ukraine is a neighbouring country to Europe, with which we have concluded negotiations on an association agreement, and one which has what we call ‘European prospects’. For that reason, therefore, there needs to be a strong demand for human rights. I am worried about the lack of political will from the Ukrainian authorities on this matter. This is emphasised with the case of Ms Yulia Tymoshenko and also other opposition leaders, victims of selective justice and a penal code from the Soviet era, as previously mentioned. It appears that their ambiguity means that there is almost no difference between political and penal responsibility. A democratic system cannot function in this manner. Fundamental rights need to be protected, and opposition politics logically have to be respected. In addition, I think it would be very convenient if the European Union could reach a unanimous view on the level and manner in which high-ranking politicians are going to attend the European Football Championships that are to be played in Ukraine next month. And, lastly, ladies and gentlemen, I was somewhat surprised to read that the President of this House entertained the Prime Minister of Ukraine last week. Given that neither the Council nor the Commission went to such lengths, I wonder whether our coordination within the institutions of the Union is appropriate, and I would like Mr Füle, the Commissioner, to tell me if this coordination exists. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, first of all, Baroness Ashton, I would like to thank you for what you said about the arbitrary and unlawful expropriation that the Repsol company in Argentina is undergoing. This measure goes against international law and the principle of legal certainty that affects all Europeans. I welcome your response and, once again, I thank you for your words, Baroness Ashton. I would now like to talk about the Howitt report. Articles 3 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union show very clearly that human rights are an extremely important part of the EU’s external relations. That is because the rule of law and human rights are a constituent part, so to speak, of this Union and its Member States, but also because in today’s world, the international community as a whole considers that human rights are universal and indivisible, and that defending them can no longer be hindered by the old principle of non-interference in Member States’ internal affairs. The report we shall vote on tomorrow shows how important human rights are for Parliament; this can be clearly seen, I believe, from the Sakharov Prize that we created in this House many years ago, and also from the support we are giving to the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. Ladies and gentlemen, respect for human rights is a highly topical issue. This can be seen from the brand new role being created, which will be responsible for protecting human rights, and from the changes and revolutions that broke out last year in the Arab world – one of the main goals of which was to recover human dignity and respect for human rights. Baroness Ashton, we must all do our utmost – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – so that those political processes can consolidate the noble aspirations for which they were initiated, and so that the expectation of freedom, pluralism, tolerance and respect for minorities is not jeopardised.

 On behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we want to declare that our vote on the resolution on the European integration process of Kosovo is based on the fact that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it was a normal independent state, recognised by the international community, and does not take into account that the status of this territory continues to be controversial. It has yet to be recognised by a majority of countries, five of which are Member States of the European Union, including Spain. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to focus on three points regarding Turkey’s accession to the European Union. The first of these is its visa policy for third country nationals. Speaking two years ago in Parliament, I expressed my surprise that Turkey did not bring this policy into line with that of the European Union. According to the European Commission’s 2011 Progress Report, Turkey has recently signed visa waiver agreements with Sudan and Yemen. I have also been informed that Iranian, Libyan, Lebanese and Syrian nationals do not require visas either. Last week, a very widely read Spanish newspaper claimed that Turkey’s visa exemption for some countries, together with its land border, which runs for thousands of kilometres, make the country a corridor of choice for organised crime. In my opinion, Turkey should make a serious effort and progressively bring itself into line with the Union’s visa policy. It is part of the acquis. It should align itself with Europe rather than continuing on its current line, which takes it in the opposite direction, distancing it from European Union policy. It should progressively align itself, and I believe that the Commission should carefully monitor this matter. Secondly, I think political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey should be closer. Turkey has recently become close to the Arab world. It occupies a very significant position in a region that is very close and very important to Europe, and which is undergoing major changes. Dialogue and cooperation between Brussels and Ankara would be very positive. Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the range of reforms that Turkey has introduced, and I hope it pursues them with determination and strength, as the report that we will approve tomorrow calls on it to do.

 Mr President, talking of enlargement encourages optimism. No Member State wishes to leave the Union; on the contrary, there are a number of states who wish to join, Iceland among them. I welcome its desire for integration and the rapid pace of adhesion negotiations. I say adhesion because that is what it is, adhering to and accepting the European Union acquis
. In the negotiations, efforts are continuing to define the adaptations that the candidate country needs to make to adopt the acquis
 and the timescale for this. In the Commission’s report of October 2011, we were told that as yet, there had been no changes to Icelandic legislation on fisheries, and that it is not in line with the EU acquis
, nor are the current restrictions on foreign investment in fisheries consistent with the acquis
: they infringe fundamental principles, like the right of establishment and the free movement of capital and services. Iceland is a major fishing nation, like my own country, Spain and my region, the Autonomous Community of Galicia. Iceland’s accession will strengthen the fisheries sector within the Union, but, Mr President, it cannot remain outside EU law in this sector. I am asking the Commission to pay the closest attention to this issue. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). -

 Mr President, Russia is very important to the European Union both as a neighbouring European country and as a global actor and permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. This is why we would like to have a closer relationship with Russia so that we can address issues of mutual interest and for reasons of global governance. However, there are obstacles to such a close relationship. We regret Russia’s behaviour during the Syrian crisis, and certain recent events, like December’s elections to the Duma, and the presidential elections on 4 March, have left us feeling disappointed and concerned. The elections did not conform to the democratic standards of a European country which is a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE. As I have said, it is in our interests to have a relationship of mutual trust with Russia, but the fundamental basis of this relationship should be shared democratic values, joint respect for human rights, the multi-party system and respect for the democratic opposition. The modern Russia we want to see is a Russia which shares European values. We can build the close relationship we want on the basis of these values. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Russia is an important neighbour for the EU, for both geographical and historical reasons, and it is also a very significant economic and energy partner. Furthermore, it is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Russia is one of the actors needed for efficient global governance capable of dealing with global problems, and we also need increased cooperation from Russia on issues such as the situation in Syria, which is on the brink of civil war, or the nuclear threat from Iran. I believe, however, that the EU wants a relationship with Russia that goes beyond those global or regional interests. Russia is a European neighbour, and a member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. I believe that we would like a relationship of real trust and friendship with Russia, based on shared values and principles. That is why we want a new association agreement and why we want for Russia what we also demand of ourselves: a pluralistic democratic regime that respects civil and political freedoms, and a rule of law in which corruption and arbitrariness are the exception. However, the organisation of the legislative elections in December did nothing to strengthen that trust. The irregularities of the election process are well known, as are the serious accusations made. I hope that the next presidential elections will not show the same shortcomings, and that Russia can finally start to move towards clear democratic progress and modernity, which is what its European partners wish for.

 Madam President, our ‘southern’ neighbourhood is going through a new phase in its history, from which there is no way back. The European Union must support these processes of democratic change, drastically altering its former complacency, which gave the impression of aiming for stability but was nothing more than inertia. As Article 8 of the Treaty of Lisbon states, our neighbourhood policy should be based on universal values such as human dignity, human rights, democracy and the rule of law, as well as having conditions and specific requirements, since not all processes are the same. There should be country-specific procedures in each case. In any event, we must embark upon dialogue with new political groups, including moderate Islamist forces, based on the values mentioned previously. We should strengthen our relations with these countries, their political and social forces and their civil societies. This is a job for the EU institutions and also for European political and social groups. Aside from the political support, we must provide economic and financial aid to these countries. Commercial opening should be gradual. It should be mutually beneficial and include the services sector, as called for by the report. We should also prioritise the administrative and institutional development of several of our neighbours to the south and help them in the fight against corruption and organised crime. I would also like to see the Union for the Mediterranean find sufficient resources to put some of the identified projects into action. These issues and many more, Madam President – and I am finishing now – are covered in the extensive report written by my brilliant colleague, Mário David, which we will be voting on tomorrow. I am sure, Mr Füle, that you and the Commission services will find it a very useful read. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, Europe and the United States are going through a severe economic crisis. Both our economies are very interconnected and during the next summit, we have to commit to act in a more coordinated manner and to implement the commitments that were made at the G20. In a globalised economy, the solutions should be global, but it is also necessary for everyone to fulfil their responsibilities in their own area. The United States should reduce its trade and fiscal deficits and China should revaluate its currency. We Europeans should finally solve the Greek crisis and the sovereign debt issues in several of our countries. Otherwise, we would not have any credibility as effective partners. The fleeting presence of President Obama in Europe to attend the G20 meeting in Cannes contrasts with the time he is dedicating to the Asia-Pacific region this week. It appears to symbolise the rise of Asia and the decline of Europe. It is not only economic challenges that we Europeans and Americans have to tackle, however, but also many others: climate change, nuclear proliferation, energy, terrorism, poverty; and regional issues such as the Arab Spring and the conflict in the Middle East. We should consult and coordinate and stop the concept of the ‘West’ or the ‘transatlantic community’ increasingly losing value to Asia’s benefit. Asia should also take part in global governance, but not by taking the role of Europe. For that we need a true Europe, a solid European Union, an efficient global player, and not a fragile set of countries that do not know how to resolve the sovereign debt crisis. This is what the United States expects and is also what our citizens want. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, religious freedom is recognised in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and also in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Egypt has been a State Party since 1982. Moreover, we know how important freedom of demonstration and expression is. The seriousness of what happened on 9 October 2011 in Cairo lies in the fact that disproportionate force was used against demonstrators who were part of a minority demanding protection for their religious freedom. There needs to be a rigorous investigation into what took place, and the guilty parties should be punished, as Mr Pöttering quite rightly said. Ms Ashton, religious freedom must be protected, and all countries must respect it, as this Parliament called for in its resolution of 20 January 2011. We want an Egypt of freedom, justice and peace; an Egypt that keeps its distance from events such as these. What is more, Egypt is a great country and a leader in the Arab world: what goes on there has major repercussions. Recent events cannot happen again. Egypt should be an example of tolerance and harmony, not one of violence and violated freedoms. The EU should do its utmost to see that freedoms are respected during the transitions taking place in the Arab world, which we wish to promote and accompany. In recent months, Christian leaders and representatives of civil society expressed their concern to me over the situation regarding religious freedom in their particular countries. Baroness Ashton, I would like you to keep us informed of the measures you intend to propose in order to strengthen the action taken by the EU in this area, as the Foreign Affairs Council asked you to do in February. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we debated the peace process here over six months ago. I stressed at that time that there was an urgent need to re-start talks because time was not in favour of either of the two parties. I can understand how the stalling of the process has prompted the Palestinians to take the initiative and to raise the issue of their admission to the United Nations. We are now in a very complex situation. I suppose that this matter will eventually be passed from the Security Council to the General Assembly. I would like the European Union and its Member States to play an active role and for the Twenty-Seven to be united in stating an opinion on the resolution that will eventually be put to the vote. There are no simple solutions: no simple yes and no simple no. The General Assembly’s resolution must be careful. It must not imperil the peace process or put either of the two sides, or the other players who are the main promoters of the process, into impossible situations. However, a failure to act must not be an option. Ladies and gentlemen, today, unfortunately, just like six months ago, I cannot be optimistic about the progress of the talks. The news we have received today about new settlements in Jerusalem is, frankly, very bad. In addition, I fear that some of the 2012 elections will not help lead to a solution. The situation could be better in 2013, but I would be sorry to have lost a year, particularly given the current dynamics of change in the Arab world. These are times of historic responsibility for the two sides, and also for the international community. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, Lady Ashton, I share your view that the EU must give its attention as a matter of priority to the southern Mediterranean, which is going through a period of extraordinary changes. I am delighted that the recent referendum in Morocco has adopted the reform promoted by King Mohammed VI. It would be good if changes at a constitutional level were accompanied by reforms in economic and social matters in order to reduce inequalities. Contrary to what is happening in Morocco, we are receiving bad news from Syria and, unfortunately, the end of the Gaddafi regime has not yet been brought about in Libya. We must remain involved in these processes, and also in Egypt and Tunisia. It is very important that we go along with the changes that are taking place in the region and we must ensure that the values of liberty, justice, democracy and respect for human rights, including freedom of conscience and religion and also gender equality, prevail. Positive conditionality or, what amounts to the same thing, the more for more strategy, should assist this as well as strengthen relations with civil society. Ladies and gentlemen, I am concluding. I hope, moreover, that the Union for the Mediterranean is finally able to act after a period of paralysis. Furthermore, as of yesterday, it has a new Secretary General, whom I wish success in the complex management of the Union. Let us hope that projects identified some three years ago can be set in motion and so contribute to improving the economy in the Mediterranean countries. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, I, too, of course, would like to add my support for the residents of Lorca. In this debate about education, I want to reiterate an important point: the need to include in secondary school studies a specific subject covering the history, aims and workings of the European Union. I have already talked about this issue in the last term, in plenary, after the failure of Constitutional Treaty referenda. Fortunately, last year in this House, the Løkkegaard report on journalism and new media, approved in September, supported the introduction of this subject in paragraph 13. I myself submitted an amendment in this regard. Recently in Spain, the Valencia regional government decided to include a subject for the next academic year. It is an initiative that other regions and countries should follow. I understand that the Commission, of course, supports and welcomes initiatives of this type. Ladies and gentlemen, we only value, we only appreciate … (The President cut off the speaker) Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to start with two initial observations. I prefer individual debates to a joint debate. We are dealing with separate issues, which deserve independent and in-depth discussion. Meanwhile, I would like to echo the words of Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra about the death of the Cuban dissident, Mr Soto. Please allow me to make three additional comments. Unfortunately, when all of us were hoping we could focus on the European Union’s external role these years, the serious economic and financial crisis has been taking up all our efforts. However, a great number of external challenges, particularly in our Mediterranean neighbourhood, mean we cannot afford to wait. The European Union must have a political and economic presence in the processes of change taking place in the Arab world. I am also celebrating, Baroness Ashton, the fact that the European Union’s voice in the United Nations General Assembly was finally strengthened in New York last week as the result of a vote that received widespread support. I congratulate you on that, given that last year’s disaster raised worrying questions about the future role of the Union in the world and in international organisations. However, the divergent European votes on Resolution 1973 of the United Nations Security Council highlight the enormous difficulties – I stress, enormous difficulties – involved in achieving an effective common security and defence policy. To summarise, Baroness Ashton, you and Mr Van Rompuy, who also has many responsibilities in foreign matters, have the huge task of convincing the Member States of the need for unified and coherent external action. The two of you will have to work hard to push, drag and lead, at a moment in history that we had intended to tackle with the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I regret the Council’s absence in today’s debate. With regard to the Southern Neighbourhood, I shall make three points. Firstly, the European Union must support and facilitate the processes of democratic change. In the past, neighbouring authorities used their concerns over stability as a way of justifying their inaction. Secondly, I wish for economic prosperity for our southern neighbours; this requires a great deal of reforms, investments, and financial and economic aid, as well as trade, not just with the North, but also South-South trade, which is currently non-existent. I am concerned about the line being taken by the Commission and the High Representative, Mrs Ashton: in an article published in The New York Times on 18 March 2011, she appears to be advising those countries to specialise in agricultural exports to European markets. I disagree. Commissioner Füle is well aware of this, although he seems to be shaking his head. These countries need diversified economies and agriculture. I repeat: diversified. They also need to attend to their domestic food needs and not restrict themselves to a few export products which, in addition, cause concern for European farmers. We therefore need common sense and prudence on this issue. Thirdly, we need to revitalise the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and its projects, which can help in the economic modernisation of the Mediterranean countries. Unfortunately, the UfM is still in deadlock, there is no General Secretary, and it cannot continue to be hijacked by the lack of progress between Israel and Palestine. Ladies and gentlemen, we are facing a major challenge. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, as indicated in the Middle East Quartet Statement made in Munich, we would all like to see the end of negotiations between Israel and Palestine in September 2011 in the form of an agreed solution for the two states that will bring peace and security. Unfortunately, the prospects are not rosy. With only six months left, negotiations have come to a standstill, stalled over the question of the settlements. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that the loss of valuable time will benefit Israel, nor will it contribute to finding a successful solution. On the one hand, I am concerned that it will become ever harder to find moderate leaders in Palestine with enough political support to be able to conclude agreements with Israel, which is no easy task. On the other hand, if the settlements remain, it will become ever harder to create a truly viable Palestine state. Lady Ashton, I agree that the peace process should not be put on hold because of political upheaval in the region. If the current events result in democratic regimes, as we all hope, regimes that will listen to the wishes of the people, the climate in the region will become even less propitious for Israel. It may be that Israel will become even more isolated and come under greater pressure from some of its Arab neighbours. In conclusion, everyone, including Israel, would benefit from reaching a solution as soon as possible. I would therefore urge the European Union to contribute actively to restarting the peace process in close cooperation with the United States and the other Quartet members. Lady Ashton, I hope that there will be a high-level Quartet meeting this month, as set out in the Munich Statement. Can you confirm whether that will be the case? Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, I am very pleased that the Commission is preparing a communication on the European strategy for the Atlantic region. This is a region that has two major, related characteristics: its oceanic-maritime nature and its peripheral character. I will make four points. Firstly, I would stress the importance of its maritime aspect, because of which, the strategy must attach importance to the preservation of the marine environment, fishing, the environment, energies related to this marine environment, and tourism. Secondly, given the peripheral nature of the region, transport – so-called ‘connectivity’ – is very important, both between the areas that make up the Atlantic region and, above all, with the rest of the European Union. The trans-European transport networks, the highways of the sea and energy connections must be given priority. With regard to Galicia, my constituency, I also have in mind the high-speed connection with the north of Portugal and the Transcantábrico train. Thirdly, Commissioner, I believe that the strategy must not focus solely on maritime issues. It must, as Mr Cadec has said, have a significant land-based dimension which includes the objectives of social, economic and territorial cohesion. As the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow indicates, the strategy for the Atlantic region must be closely connected with the Europe 2020 strategy, and with regional development policy and future economic prospects. Finally, the various administrations and organisations that exist in the Atlantic region must be taken closely into account, including the regional government of Galicia and the Euroregion created with the neighbouring community of North Portugal, which were amongst the first in the European Union to create a European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation. All of this means that there is a need for the Commission to maintain a permanent dialogue with these regions and entities, during both the development of the strategy and its subsequent implementation.

Mr President, we need further clarification on the Supreme Military Council’s plans in Egypt. One specific undertaking is the holding of democratic elections within six months, following a constitutional reform led by experts. However, I have also read that next week we will see a new government supposedly including opposition representatives, according to the British Foreign Secretary. I think we all agree, in any case, that the best way forward is to have a transitional process, supported by the widest possible political consensus, until the elections are held. It would also be desirable for the social forces to work together to ensure that this transition is unburdened by major tensions. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union must support the democratic process and contribute to its success. Egypt is a key country, and developments there will be felt throughout the Mediterranean and the Arab world. I therefore welcome Baroness Ashton’s visit to Cairo next week. One further point: The Tunisians and the Egyptians have given us a lesson in the people’s desire for freedom. I hope the foreign ministers will not overlook this lesson when they come to assess the common position on Cuba, which is precisely aimed at attaining a democratic transition in that country, and which defends those who defend freedom. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).

 Madam President, the events taking place in Tunisia and Egypt are very significant and it is possible that these processes of change will spread to other countries in the Mediterranean region, which is a region of the highest importance to the European Union. These countries are right on our doorstep and we have numerous strong ties of friendship with them. In the last decade, the European Union has been unable to persuade their authorities to undertake the necessary reforms. In the last parliamentary term I myself stressed that stability could not continue to be used to justify a lack of change, but rather that these countries needed profound political, economic and social reforms. Now change and reform are being demanded by the people on the streets. Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that the Council finally paid attention to these events on Monday and has taken a position. I too have the impression that the transition process in Tunisia is headed in the right direction. However, the wider perception is, unfortunately, that the European Union has been almost absent from these processes in recent weeks. We have heard several speeches by President Obama, we have heard statements from Secretary of State Clinton, and we have even heard about contact between the Tunisian Army and representatives of the US Army… The Union’s visibility has been in no way comparable. The Treaty of Lisbon’s new mechanisms should have been more active and visible, including the President of the European Council. Baroness Ashton, I welcome your trip to Tunisia in two weeks’ time, but I also believe that we must improve our capacities for prediction and reaction. Do we want to be a major global player? We need to start with being relevant at regional level, as a minimum. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, this debate is very necessary given the recent serious events that are affecting the religious freedom and even the lives of Christians. I am particularly referring to what has happened mainly in Pakistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Egypt. Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights sets out in great detail what it calls freedom of religion or religious freedom. Despite this, it is, unfortunately, a right that is little respected in some countries. We are now even seeing that those who profess the Christian faith can pay for it with their lives. Baroness Ashton, the European Union must robustly defend the right to religious freedom in general, clearly incorporating it into its external action and demanding respect, freedom and security for what is now the most persecuted religious group in the world, the Christian community. We must demand that all the governments concerned do what is necessary to prevent these attacks, and when that is not possible, to arrest and punish those responsible. Ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, freedom is a symbol of European identity, and that includes religious freedom, which is part of the basic core of human rights. That freedom is also a path to peace, as Pope Benedict XVI said in his message on 1 January. I would also like to highlight the essential role of Christianity in shaping the European identity. It would therefore be a sad paradox if the European Union did not demand as firmly as possible that the world protect the most basic rights of Christians and did not help them where it could. The European Parliament resolution sets out methods for better defending religious freedom in general and the freedom of Christians in particular. I welcome the fact that the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council is to give them close consideration, and – I am finishing now, Mr President – that the forthcoming European Council on 14 February is to give its opinion on these serious events, just as, for example, President Sarkozy very courageously did.

Mr President, this debate on Libya is taking place at a time when very significant changes are happening in another neighbouring Mediterranean country: Tunisia. I have always believed that the European Union must help to promote serious reforms in the Mediterranean region, with the aim of making it an area of freedom and prosperity. I refer to my speeches in this House in recent years, in which I have repeatedly said that the Union’s policy cannot be focused on simply maintaining the status quo
. This is not, however, the specific issue being debated today, which is the Framework Agreement with Libya. I would like to stress the need to cooperate with Libya in managing migratory flows, including an agreement to readmit illegal immigrants including third-country nationals, as is the case in all readmission agreements concluded by the Union. Giving in to Libyan positions that are contrary to this agreement would be detrimental given Libya’s important position as a transit country, and it would also send a very negative message for the negotiations with Morocco and Algeria on readmission agreements, which have been in deadlock for many years. However, we do also have to insist that the Libyan authorities respect the rights of refugees, including – as has already been said – the principle of non-refoulement. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would also like to express my concern regarding the impact of this agreement on the canned tuna fishing sector, which is very important in Spain and particularly in Galicia, my constituency. This negative impact is, as has been said, due to an unprecedented and ill-founded concession: the exemption from the rules of origin for processed fish products, when requested, due to not having sufficient indigenous raw materials. That was the first thing that Papua New Guinea did, and the exemption is being applied. Papua New Guinea is thus becoming a major platform for the processing and export of tuna from the European industry’s major competitors: the Philippines, Thailand, China and the United States. It is really they who are the major beneficiaries of the agreement. It is estimated that this tuna production will ultimately amount to 400 000 tonnes per year, destined for the European market, which currently consumes a total of around 710 000 tonnes. The impact will be very serious, as the prices of the tuna from Papua New Guinea are one third lower than the price of European tuna, due to the country’s low wages and non-existent environmental standards. In my region, Galicia, this is considered to be unbeatable competition, which will have serious consequences for employment. I want the impact assessment announced by the European Commission to be as rigorous as possible and to take into account the short and medium-term consequences of this exemption from the rules of origin. I hope that it will put an end to the application of this exemption as soon as possible. It is an exceptional and temporary measure, but it appears that in Papua New Guinea, they consider it to be a permanent one: otherwise, the investments would not be made. I also hope that this exemption is not included in other agreements or in the final agreement. Currently, however, there is a problem with the provisional agreement, and it must be rectified. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, the Union’s most important strategic relationship is the one it has with the United States. We must maintain a continuous dialogue on bilateral issues and also on global issues, and try to ensure the most coordinated action possible. In my view, this is the main message of tomorrow’s resolution. I therefore regretted the fact that the planned summit in May was not held. Moreover, I found the argument given at the time that there was no agenda to be absurd. There is always an agenda between two partners that are so important and which are immersed in a global economic crisis, and when there are challenges such as terrorism, climate change, energy security or nuclear proliferation. Moreover, there are major regional conflicts, for example, the Middle East peace process, the Iranian nuclear challenge or the issue of Afghanistan, which, in my view, are worthy of coordinated action by the United States and the European Union. I hope that the forthcoming Lisbon summit will be a success. There are many issues to tackle, some of which I have already mentioned. Moreover, the world is changing. Asia is in the ascendancy; let us think about the importance of China or India, which President Obama has just visited. There is even talk of a post-Western world. In this context of a changing world order, we need close coordination between Europe and the United States. We have many interests, ideals and values in common. We will be stronger if we act in a coordinated way. Ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has also created new bodies to strengthen the Union’s role in the world. We should therefore also improve our mechanisms for dialogue and coordination with the United States. The resolution adopted by Parliament in March last year contains many ideas as to how to strengthen those institutional mechanisms for dialogue between Brussels and Washington. My final comment is that I regret the fact that the representative of the Council only referred to an exchange of data; he did not come here to talk about the summit, about which we heard nothing. Unfortunately, the Commission did so only very briefly. Who really came here to talk about the summit? Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I am really delighted that the European Council has discussed the Union’s external action. We are in a new world, which is multipolar from an economic point of view and increasingly from a political point of view, with a smaller number of significant players. Moreover, the challenges that we face are global ones. No country can face them alone, including the countries of the EU. As the President of the Commission said a few days ago, in a global world, size does matter. The European Union must be one of those players. I therefore regret the result of the vote in New York last week on strengthening the EU’s position in the United Nations. What happened is very concerning. I think it would be very good for careful preparations to be made in future for summits with the other major players. As well as tackling the way that the other players voted on 14 September in New York, they are also needed to tackle important bilateral and multilateral issues. Among other things, we need to govern globalisation, adapting the institutions that were established after the Second World War and strengthening more recent forums such as the G20. In doing all these things, I also think that we need to be working in harmony with the United States. We share many values and interests with them, and I trust that sound preparations are being made for the summit on 20 November. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union’s external action will have more continuity and consistency. However, along with the internal strength of the Union, the political will for joint action by the 27 is also essential, particularly among the most significant Member States. This process of uniting will inevitably be a long and difficult one. It is necessary, however, if we want to prevent Europe from being irrelevant and prevent what is beginning to be described as the advent of a post-Western era.

On behalf of the Spanish delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we would like to state that the reasoning behind our vote on the resolution on the process relating to the European integration of Kosovo is that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it were an independent state in an entirely normal situation, without taking into account the fact that the status of this territory continues to be very controversial within the international community – an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice is also pending – and Kosovo has not been recognised by five Member States of the European Union, including Spain. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Madam President, the importance of relations with Russia for the European Union is obvious: it is a powerful neighbour, a strategic economic and energy partner, and a permanent member of the Security Council. Russia now seems to be more peaceful and settled, thanks to the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the United States, overcoming its disagreement with the anti-missile shield and the agreements that it has reached with the new Ukrainian Government. Furthermore, the tension caused two years ago by its intervention in Georgia has decreased. In this new context, we all welcome Russia’s support of the recent Security Council Resolution 1929 on Iran. This is therefore a good time to improve relations with Russia. Consequently, Baroness Ashton, I regret the fact that there has not been any progress in the negotiation of the new partnership agreement with Russia that first requires Russia to join the World Trade Organisation, something that has also still not been clarified. Ladies and gentlemen, there needs to be an ambitious agreement that includes and regulates energy, investment and trade issues. Clear, legally binding rules are what is needed. Also, I do, of course, agree with the European Union supporting and helping Russia in its desire to modernise, but the Partnership for Modernisation, which was the framework for the relationship established at the recent summit, should not be an alternative to the aforementioned agreement. I certainly welcome the fact that the Presidency is including the effective functioning of the judicial system and stepping up the fight against corruption in that partnership. I will conclude now: what I also want is a single, efficient and coherent EU policy, and I hope that the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon – you yourself, High Representative, and the permanent President of the European Council – will help us to achieve this aim of a single, coherent policy. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, a preliminary clarification: in my view, either a representative of the Presidency of the Council, or, perhaps, of the current French co-presidency of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), should have spoken in this debate today; their absence is deeply regrettable. Ladies and gentlemen, it is a priority for the European Union to ensure that its closest neighbours form an area of peace, prosperity, freedom and security. This should be the primary objective of the UfM, which I hope is due to hold its second summit next month. I would like to congratulate Mr Peillon and to express my thanks, most especially, for his open-minded and extremely constructive approach. In spite of the proximity of the European Union to the southern shores of the Mediterranean, there are considerable differences separating us in economic, political, social, demographic and cultural terms, and so on. Some of these disparities are due to serious deficiencies in our neighbouring states. It is crucial to promote close dialogue and cooperation within the framework of the UfM, and to bring forward those major joint projects which it has identified, as well as the bilateral dimension of the association agreements, in order to strengthen the relationship between both shores and to be able to reduce these disparities. In order to achieve this, our neighbours, too, must implement reforms. Standing still cannot be an option. I would like briefly to raise three further points. Firstly, it is very important for the secretariat of the UfM in Barcelona to be fully operational as soon as possible. Secondly, and closely linked to the previous point, the UfM must not fall hostage to conflicts, such as that in the Middle East. The UfM can facilitate a solution but it does not claim to be the means to the solution nor should it be blocked by these confrontations. Thirdly and lastly, the UfM must also pay particular attention to what is known as Chapter Four of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation: migration, security, social integration and justice.

 Mr President, we are all concerned by the increase in violence in Ciudad Juarez, but I trust in the broad measures that the Mexican authorities have put in place in order to effectively tackle this complex situation. I also support the vigorous battle President Calderón is currently waging against drugs trafficking, which is a very serious global threat that concerns us all. That is why we should help the Mexican authorities in this difficult struggle. Ladies and gentlemen, over the past 10 years, Mexico has gone through a very positive process of political and governmental modernisation. President Calderón is steadily promoting reforms. Mexico has also taken on greater international responsibilities and is playing an active role within, for example, the United Nations and the G-20. In this Parliament, within my modest capabilities, I have always supported the establishment of a strategic partnership between the European Union and Mexico, which we finally achieved in 2008. I hope we can adopt an ambitious joint action plan or programme at the May Summit in Madrid, because the European Union and Mexico need to work together in many areas, both on a bilateral level and in multilateral forums, in order to confront challenges and threats together, including drugs trafficking and other forms of organised crime Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, the Union’s foreign policy is entering a new phase, as Baroness Ashton and Mr Albertini have said this morning. Article 21 of the treaty establishes objective principles. New positions are also created by the treaty, with a High Representative, a Vice-President of the Commission, a permanent President of the European Council, a European External Action Service, and a new Security and Defence Policy, which is the subject of the report by my colleague Mr Danjean, etc. These innovations aim to ensure that the European Union has a much more effective influence in the world, and I think that summits with third countries continue to be an ideal instrument for achieving this. The European Union does not hold many summits with individual countries, so we should take care with them. The summit held last week with Morocco was the first summit with an Arab country, and also symbolised advanced status being granted to Morocco. I would have liked you to have attended, Baroness Ashton. I also regret that the King of Morocco was not present. His absence meant that a summit that should have been historic lost political influence, significance and effectiveness. I hope that the Union for the Mediterranean Summit in Barcelona will also be successful in terms of the level of the delegations. I also regret the fact that the summit with President Obama planned for the spring is not going to take place. As the Albertini report states, the Treaty of Lisbon sets the stage for strengthening our mechanisms for dialogue with the United States. This and other subjects could have been dealt with at the summit. The European Union and the United States should not miss the opportunity to deal at a high level with the bilateral matters, conflicts and global challenges that are now mounting up on the world’s agenda. It would be paradoxical – and I will finish now – if now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, we ran the risk of becoming irrelevant in this world that some are now calling ‘post-Western’ or ‘post-American’. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Madam President, democracy and defending human rights have an important place among the Union’s principles and objectives for external action – I refer to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union. This Article also applies to relations with Cuba and with the Cuban people, who are very dear to us. Unfortunately, in the last five years, the Council’s actions appear to have been essentially governed by a desire to correct the line adopted in previous years, especially in 2003 when there was an extremely harsh wave of oppression in Cuba. In 2005, the Council suspended the 2003 measures. Subsequently, there were trips to the island by foreign ministers and commissioners. In June 2008, the 2003 measures were lifted and a global political dialogue was established – as Mr López Garrido reminded us – along with regular high-level meetings. A Head of State of a Member State even recently visited Havana. Unfortunately, the European political leaders who went to the island did not have any time to meet with the representatives of the dissidents, who therefore felt marginalised. Over all this time, repression in Cuba has continued. There have been no changes or reforms. Nevertheless, political dialogue has been maintained. Now we are all shaken up by the cruel death of the political prisoner, Orlando Zapata. As is well known, ladies and gentlemen, some governments, such as the Spanish Government, have repeatedly said that they want to cancel the common position. It says something very logical: support for democratic transition, essentially the same thing that is required by the principles and objectives of Article 21 of the treaty. I will conclude with two points. The common position has not hindered dialogue. This is obvious. What is more, it was reconfirmed recently by the 27 ministers, in June 2009. Secondly, the priority cannot be to change the common position – that would be the last straw! The priority now is to ask for the immediate, complete and unconditional release of all political prisoners. I see Cuba and Latin America as Western, and the symbols that identify the West are the dignity of human beings and respect for their fundamental rights. I have a final thought: I would like to remind the Council that, in its own conclusions in June 2009, it said that the future of political dialogue with the Cuban authorities was dependent on progress being made, in particular, on human rights. Can anyone say that this progress is taking place today? Can anyone really say that? Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, may I welcome the Commissioner. In this decade, enlargement policy has been the European Union’s greatest success, along with the euro. That policy should not be held back. Furthermore, we cannot break the commitments we have made with candidate countries, although we should also respect the well-known principles of consolidation and conditionality. We also should not forget the European Union's integration capacity or the need to communicate with citizens on the subject of enlargement and its advantages and consequences. Given the time restrictions, I shall just make a few brief comments. In principle, candidate countries should resolve beforehand any territorial disputes and similar issues they might have with each other and with Member States, so as not to later slow down the operation of the Union. In the case of Turkey, I would particularly like to highlight how important it is for the rate of reforms – which are also necessary for Turkey itself – to be maintained and even increased. I also welcome the recent commitment Turkey has shown with regard to Nabucco, which is very important for energy diversification in Europe. However, I must admit that I was somewhat surprised by the gesture that the Turkish Government made last autumn in support of the Iranian authorities. Indeed, I believe that a candidate country’s foreign policy should be in line with that of the Union. Finally, last week, I read an interview with the Turkish Minister for European Affairs which seemed to suggest that Turkey had abolished visas for countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Libya. I was somewhat surprised by this because a candidate country should also be bringing its visa policy closer to that of the European Union, not moving in the opposite direction. I would like confirmation of that information. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has strengthened the European Union’s commitment to stability and development in Afghanistan through the action plan. I would, of course, like to know more about funding for this plan as far as Afghanistan is concerned. Another very important moment for Afghanistan will be the London Conference in January. At that conference, we will hear about the specific pledges made by the European Union and its Member States. We should also hear from the new Afghan Government about the many commitments it must make in areas such as combating corruption and drug trafficking. I am rather alarmed at reports in today’s press of the speech given yesterday by President Karzai on the corruption issue. Ladies and gentlemen, President Obama’s decision to increase his military contingent by 30 000 troops is very recent. In short, Afghanistan is at a crucial stage and the United States and Europe must work in a very coordinated manner. What is at stake in Afghanistan is not only the prosperity and freedom of Afghans, but also the stability of the region, including such an important country as Pakistan. Our own security is also at stake, given the continuing threat posed by al-Qaeda, as has already been said. The credibility of NATO and of what we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan. We cannot fail. In order to succeed, though, as has also been said, we need the support of our own citizens. This support is conditional on transparency and clarity. We must explain that our compatriots in Afghanistan are in serious danger, but we must also stress the importance of the mission there and that failure cannot be an option. As I have said, many important factors are at stake. Francisco José Millán Mon and José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 With regard to the resolution on the Commission’s enlargement strategy paper for 2009, we would like to make it clear, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), that the fact that we supported it overall does not in any way mean that we agree with the recognition of Kosovo as an independent State. We feel that Kosovo is an exceptional case, and we would like to point out that it has not been recognised by Spain or by four other Member States. Consequently, both in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and today in plenary, we have supported the amendments that were in line with our viewpoint. Our vote in favour of the resolution is due to the fact that we do not want our position on Kosovo to be understood as a negative attitude to the enlargement process that the countries of the Western Balkans, Turkey and Iceland are now involved in. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, the enlargement process has been a resounding success. The latest enlargement has allowed us to come together with those countries of Central and Eastern Europe that were unfairly denied freedom and prosperity after the Second World War. At present, enlargement is focusing on the western Balkans, Turkey and Iceland. I endorse the ideas that we have identified as the guiding principles of the enlargement process in recent years. I mean consolidation, conditionality and communication. That is to say, that we should fulfil our obligations, but not make rash promises on future enlargements. Secondly, progress in the various accession processes is subject to strict compliance with the conditions. The candidate countries must make a determined effort to carry out the necessary reforms. Thirdly, we must all make an effort to communicate with the citizens. The resolution we are to vote on tomorrow highlights the very important issue of communication. In this connection, I should like to reiterate the broader proposal I made on previous occasions, namely that it would be appropriate also to enhance young Europeans’ knowledge of the Union by making this a compulsory subject in the upper secondary school curriculum. Another relevant idea contained in the resolution is the capacity for integration. Enlargement requires existing Members of the Union to take certain measures. Regarding finance, for instance, enlargement calls for sufficient financial resources to ensure that essential community policies such as the common agricultural policy or cohesion policy are not put at risk. I am about to conclude. I should like to point out that as we are all aware, Kosovo is a special case. Unfortunately, however, there are sections of the resolution where this particularity is not made clear. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, with regard to the Fajon report, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to point out that, although we voted for the report, we do not agree with recital 2a, added by Amendment 4, which states that the Commission ‘should start a visa dialogue with Kosovo with a view to establishing a roadmap for visa facilitation and liberalisation similar to those established with Western Balkan countries’. In my delegation’s view, Kosovo cannot be put on the same footing as the Western Balkan countries. I would point out that Kosovo has not been recognised by the Spanish authorities or by any other Member States. Since the amendment I have mentioned was voted on in block voting with many other amendments, we were not able to vote against it, but we would like it placed on the record that we are not in agreement with its content.

Madam President, relations with Russia are very important: it is a permanent member of the Security Council and a military power; its cooperation is necessary in order to tackle the nuclear challenge of Iran, the issue of the Middle East, disarmament, climate change, etc. Moreover, Russia is a neighbouring country of Europe with which many EU Member States have significant economic relationships and high levels of energy dependence. It is a country with which we have two regular annual summits (which certainly provide a good opportunity at which to evaluate the state of the relationship). Now we are negotiating a new partnership agreement, which would increase cooperation in the so-called four ‘common spaces’. In my view, the most important of these spaces is the economic and energy space: we need openness, clear rules, guarantees for investments, and Russia first of all needs to join the WTO. Next week’s summit should therefore be an opportunity to clarify Russia’s intentions with regard to the WTO and to ensure it does not take initiatives that are incompatible with it. In addition, the gas supply crisis of recent years should not be allowed to recur and the new agreement must include the principles of the European Energy Charter which, as has already been said, is the treaty from which Moscow has unfortunately withdrawn. We must continue to work on the other three spaces as well. I have already mentioned the importance of Russia as a global player. Ladies and gentlemen, we can do many things together with Russia, but, as has also been said, there is one aspect of the relationship that we should not forget, since Russia is a European country and a neighbour. That is the need for it to respect human rights and the obligations that its membership of the Council of Europe imposes upon it in that regard. One of the most obvious failures of the EU’s external affairs policy is the lack of a common policy with regard to Russia. With the instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon, it will be simpler to create this common policy, but it is also necessary for us, as Member States, to have a genuine will to create such a united policy and not to continue prioritising bilateral channels with Moscow, which are, at times, openly divergent from each other.

 Madam President, the relationship with the United States is, strategically speaking, the European Union’s most important relationship. The United States holds a key position in the world and the European Union is increasingly becoming a global actor. We can, and should, undertake many things together. First of all, we should take a leading role in creating a new, global world, featuring new challenges and the emergence of new actors. We need to further strengthen our relationship and create new institutional mechanisms. This is the right time to undertake such action. We have a government in Washington which favours multilateralism, a European Union strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon and we are witnessing the emergence of a new world which we want to shape together. The resolution we will adopt tomorrow specifically supports the strengthening of the institutional mechanisms, something which Parliament called for in its resolution of 26 March. The decision to create the Transatlantic Economic Council two years ago was the right one. However, in today’s world, we also need to develop excellent coordination in terms of policies and security. We need regular meetings between officials responsible for external affairs and security. That is why this House, this Parliament, supported the creation of a Transatlantic Political Council which, in the future, must include the energy council that you wish to establish at the next summit. The Parliament also wants two summits to take place every year. If we have two summits with Russia, why not with the United States? Ladies and gentlemen, there is increasing talk of a G2 being set up by the United States and China, that is to say, a privileged relationship between the top global players. It worries me that we Europeans may weaken our role as partners and undermine our privileged relationship with the United States. We must explain to the United States that, in the field of foreign policy, the Union will be strengthened by the Treaty. The European Union, or the Europe of today, is no longer the problem it had been for decades. Today, in this complex world, Europe should be part of the solution, and I hope that is the way the United States sees the situation. In order for this to occur, as the Commissioner pointed out, Europeans also need to act in line with the global role we want to have, and to be up to the mark, with respect to the privileged relationship to which we aspire with the United States. To summarise, a key issue for the upcoming summit, in my opinion, should be the strengthening of transatlantic relations, including at institutional level. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, given the EU’s dependence on external energy supplies, securing its supply is an issue which must always form part of the EU’s external policy. In addition, all predictions agree that energy demand in the world will increase significantly over the next 25 years. Here in Europe, we have to reduce our high dependence on Russian gas, particularly following the crises in recent years. There is also a clear strategy in Russia to secure its dominance in Europe over the gas sector. That is why we have projects such as Nord Stream, Blue Stream II and also South Stream. We therefore need to diversify in terms of suppliers and routes. That is the reason for the interest in Nabucco, which will give access to Azerbaijani and Iraqi gas, and also to gas from Turkmenistan, thus reinforcing our energy relations with Central Asia, which is an increasingly important region. I am therefore delighted about the agreement reached last July, as reported by the Commissioner, and also the explicit support given to Nabucco by President Barroso in the political guidelines that he recently presented. I know that there are doubts about the viability of Nabucco, but I also had doubts about the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, which is now a reality. I must stress that the countries around the southern rim of the Mediterranean also have an important role to play in the supply of gas to Europe. The main country in this respect is Algeria, which is an important supplier of gas to my country and to Italy. We must ensure that the work on the Medgaz pipeline is quickly completed. I also want to highlight countries such as Egypt and Libya in terms of gas supplies. To sum up, energy issues must be a priority in the Euro-Mediterranean relationship, to the benefit of both sides. Ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon includes energy as a shared responsibility and lays down that one of the EU’s energy policy objectives will be to guarantee the security of energy supplies. This really encourages us to move forward with developing an increasingly essential common foreign policy on energy, as stressed by the motion for a resolution to be adopted today. I will end by saying that this is a difficult objective, as proven by our failure in Europe, in the European Union, to achieve a true internal market in energy, because we do not even have the necessary interconnections. That is why I am delighted about the commitments made in this respect in the document mentioned by President Barroso. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I am here to talk about Iran, and I would first like to join in expressing my condolences for the victims of this morning’s plane crash. Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with many of the ideas that have already been expressed regarding the situation in Iran following the electoral process. This process was neither free nor fair, and has allowed President Ahmadinejad and the most radical sectors of the regime to remain in power, violently repressing demonstrators, preventing journalists from doing their job and seeking to hold a supposed external conspiracy responsible for internal disorder, while using misinformation to conceal the truth. What is certain is that the Iranian regime has been seriously damaged, both internally and in terms of its external image. Moreover, the oligarchy that has enjoyed power in recent decades is now divided, which will affect the stability of the regime. At the same time, discontent among the people will continue to grow, especially if oil prices do not rise again and consequently the economic situation does not improve. The European Union needs to maintain a united front and continue to condemn the abuses committed in Iran. It should demand greater respect for human rights, and we also need to look at how we can help civil society, in particular those sectors that want democratic pluralism and respect for human rights for their country. We should not disappoint those sectors that are looking to the West, including the European Union. However, with regard to Iran we must also not forget the threat that its nuclear programme represents, as it is having a destabilising effect on the region and on non-proliferation in general. It is essential that the European Union and the United States continue to cooperate on this matter, and I am sure that this will be a priority for the Swedish Presidency. We need to fully involve Russia and China, which are permanent members of the Security Council. Their support is essential in order for a negotiated solution to be found to this grave threat, which requires unity and firmness from the international community. I therefore welcome the resolution adopted in this respect last week at the G8. Ladies and gentlemen, the events of the last few weeks have openly demonstrated the extremism and radical nature of the current Iranian leaders; it is clear that the international community cannot afford for them to obtain nuclear weapons.

Mr President, Commissioner, these are tough times for the European fisheries sector. The serious economic crisis that is devastating Europe, the scarcity of marine resources needed to allow the fleets to be economically viable and the negotiations on agreements that are often unacceptable because of their detrimental interests, mean that the sector is looking towards the future with some concern. If we add to that the shameful obstruction of the multiannual plans by the Council, which is also seeking pretexts for reneging on the Treaty itself – something that we absolutely will not stand for – we end up with a panorama that is pretty bleak. We are discussing different aspects of great importance, including the external dimension of the common fisheries policy, which enables the EU fleet to fish in the high seas and in third-country waters, and through which the European Union also exports principles of good governance, leading the fight for sustainability, ensuring food security in the least-developed countries and eradicating illegal fishing. In all, 60 % of the fish consumed in the European Union comes from third-country imports and, as a consequence, one of the objectives of the external dimension of this policy must be to ensure the continuity of the economically viable high-sea fishing. We do not agree that the fisheries agreements should entail an exclusivity clause that prevents the European fleet from fishing in third-country waters when the European Union has failed to conclude a new protocol and we have several examples of that. Nor do we agree that there should be penalties for the temporary reflagging of EU vessels when they change their flag so that they can access third-country waters – even if those countries comply with all of the international regulations – where no agreement on access to resources has been reached. Similarly, we do not agree with the fact that the fishing authorisation fees that shipowners have to pay to access the fishery resources of a third country can triple on occasion without a cost-benefit analysis having been carried out. In my opinion, it is pointless to propose keeping fish stocks above, rather than at, maximum sustainable yield, as this would reduce fishing opportunities by more than is necessary. For these and other reasons, our group has tabled an alternative motion for a resolution, which, in our opinion, improves the rapporteur’s proposal. In conclusion, Commissioner – and I see that the Council is absent once again – fisheries is such an important sector that it is crucial for the three institutions to be able to reach agreement and work towards the same goal. Parliament certainly will. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

I am a firm advocate of programmes aimed at education and young people and specifically of the Erasmus programme, and I am concerned by the news regarding its immediate future. However, as a Member from an outermost region such as the Canary Islands, I am also concerned that our young people do not enjoy equal opportunities in the mobility measures financed by the EU. Young people from the Canary Islands cannot and should not be in a worse situation than other young people in the EU due to living in an outermost region. Youth unemployment figures in the outermost regions are really worrying and it is our duty to ensure that the additional cost of students travelling from their outermost region of origin is borne by the programme itself and not by the students, who often see this additional cost as an insurmountable obstacle that prevents them from accessing Erasmus grants. Yes there should be Erasmus for all, but that should include young people from the outermost regions. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, I am not going to talk about independence for Catalonia, I am going to talk about La Gomera, a small island which is part of the Canary Islands and which has experienced an appalling fire, a fire which began on 4 August and was not extinguished officially until last month, in September. Not only has the fire affected the Garajonay National Park, which has been a World Heritage site since 1986, it has also scorched around 11 % of the surface area of the island, and more than 4 000 people have had to be evacuated. The damage caused to the environment, to the economy and to the living conditions of the islanders has been estimated at around EUR 60 million and is very difficult to rectify. So, what I would like to talk about today is solidarity, the solidarity of Europe with a very small but very important part of the Europe which unites us, about Europe’s solidarity with La Gomera and its inhabitants. The Spanish Government has already requested the intervention of the Solidarity Fund. All that remains now is for it to become effective and for us to help La Gomera to move forward. We are talking about the future of the island and that future is something for which we are all responsible. Gabriel Mato Adrover,

Mr President, Commissioner, based on the fact that in my view the agreements with Peru, Colombia and Central America are tremendously damaging for European banana producers, and the Canary Islands in particular, and that the only safety margin we have left is economic compensation via the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), which I hope is obtained, I have to express my satisfaction, given that these reports have included many of our proposals, which I am grateful for. The negotiated safeguard clauses have been improved and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas has been strengthened. There will be greater transparency and exhaustive monitoring of banana imports into the European Union with prior surveillance measures. Moreover, and what I believe is an essential point, the Commission shall present an annual report on how the clause is functioning, which should include an examination of the development of banana imports and their impact on European production. These are all very positive elements. European banana producers, all of which also come from the outermost regions, need help during these difficult times. There still some way to go, but this is a very significant step. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, if I may, I shall use my speech in this joint debate on fisheries policy in order to make some demands. Today, we are debating good reports that properly define Parliament’s efforts to achieve sustainable fishing by preserving fish stocks, and which try to establish a common organisation of the markets in which consumers are not only protected but also well informed. In addition, we are stressing the need to take action against those who authorise unsustainable fishing, and we are doing so by discussing, debating and reaching agreements. Unfortunately, however, those efforts clash with the actions of those who sometimes confuse confidentiality with a lack of transparency, with protocol negotiations carried out behind Parliament’s back and, what is worse, behind the backs of those who should be benefiting from the very same agreement. Commissioner Damanaki, there is still time to rectify this situation. Please do so. Our efforts also clash with those who are less concerned about blocking instruments that are fundamental to developing the sector as they are about not losing powers which even the Treaty does not bestow on them. Mr Mavroyiannis, we still have time. Stop blocking the management plans. It is important for the fishing industry and therefore for the citizens of Europe and for us. Therefore, at a time of uncertainty with so many boats and so few fishing opportunities, with fierce competition from imported products and a considerable reduction in subsidies, we have an obligation to support this reform. We should do so bearing in mind the fishermen in Galicia, Andalusia, the Canary Islands and all the other regions of Europe. They expect something very simple from us: that we do not let them down. Gabriel Mato Adrover,

Mr President, Commissioner, I want to clearly express, with the resolution and conviction given to us by the force of reason, the Committee on Fisheries’ unanimous concern when it comes to possible agreements under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) on state responsibility for vessels’ activities. Ladies and gentlemen, in the fishing regulations of both the European Union and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), there is an overall principle that is paradigm in the regulation to control fishing activities and the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing: it establishes that the flag state is primarily responsible for controlling its vessels’ activities, wherever they work. Based on this principle, the flag state must, for example, certify that their vessels’ catches conform to legislation. This catch certification is essential to these catches being unloaded in EU ports and being sent to market. However, it is also essential to respect the adopted conservation and fishing management measures, the objective of which is to ultimately bring fish stocks up to sustainable levels for fishing. Many states without their own fleet must charter ships from other countries to fish, which is natural, as long as they comply with the legal requirements. That said, Commissioner, you are aware, as we all are, that many of these chartering states have neither the resources, the capacity, nor often the will to control the fishing activities of these vessels. You will agree that, if there is no guarantee of an effective control of fishing activities, it is absolutely impossible to fight against illegal fishing and it is very difficult to aid sustainability, which is the cornerstone of our common fisheries policy (CFP) and the focus of its reform, which we are currently debating in Parliament. In the latest CITES meeting, the Working Group on Introduction from the Sea discussed the flag state’s responsibility over the species covered by CITES, and proposed to transfer this responsibility to the chartering state for CITES species caught on the high seas. This working group will report to the Standing Committee of the Convention in July 2012 and this committee, in turn, will report to the Conference of the Parties (COP) at the March 2013 meeting, when a definitive decision will be taken. According to my information on the European Union, the Commission held a meeting with the Member States last Monday. During this meeting, the Commission appears to have inexplicably announced that there is no official position, that is, that the Member States are free to adopt whichever position they consider to be most convenient for their interests in the upcoming COP. If this is the case, Commissioner, you can understand that it is both disappointing and discouraging that the Commission has not taken a stand on such a vital issue, particularly during a period when we are reforming the CFP. I have been informed that in the coming days, there will be a meeting between Member States and the Commission itself to adopt a common position. I think that there is still time to rectify the situation and for the Commission to send out a clear and resounding message, preventing the derogation of what has been the basic principle up until now: the flag state’s responsibility. This issue is a lot more important than some irresponsibly believe. If the proposal goes ahead, it will set a precedent that will undoubtedly cause great harm to our fisheries management and to the fight against illegal fishing. The Commission cannot allow all the work undertaken hitherto to be thrown away. It has been a joint effort on two aspects in which Parliament is completely involved and which also involves regional organisations such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) or the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) itself. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will finish. Under no circumstances, in my opinion, should the charter state be granted responsibility for controlling their vessels’ activity; this must remain the flag state’s responsibility. This is the unequivocal position of the Committee on Fisheries of this Parliament, and I hope it is also that of the Commission itself. For that reason, I ask if the Commission could explain its position on the issue and how it will ensure that the primary responsibility of the flag state is maintained. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, we are debating herring, we are debating multiannual plans, but essentially, we are debating jurisdiction, the competencies of Parliament and the need for the Council to accept and most importantly respect what was established in the Treaty of Lisbon, and furthermore, to respect the decision of the legal services themselves. This is codecision and in this context, a political decision by the Council that not only calls into question the competencies of Parliament, something which we cannot or should not allow of course, but most importantly, puts the future of such essential issues as the reform of the common fisheries policy at risk. I am addressing the absent Council members and also the Commissioner today; I think the issue is much more important than some believe. Give some thought to the matter. Gabriel Mato Adrover,

Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, please believe me when I say that, with this being my first speech before this House as chair of the Committee on Fisheries, I would rather not have had to make it, because we are not only going to talk about fishing, total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas – although these are very important – but also issues of jurisdiction. The question I asked on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries relates to the Treaty of Lisbon and how it should be applied in the area of fisheries policies, and, as I said previously, this goes much further than an isolated discrepancy. It concerns the undertaking by the three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – to accept the rules of the game that we agreed upon, based on the premise which underlies the Treaty: to take appropriate decisions, each according to its responsibilities, in the interests of the citizens of Europe. There is no doubt that the new Treaty has made major changes to the decision-making process for fisheries policy, and understandably it is going to take time to make the necessary adjustments to ensure that the new procedures operate correctly and in full. However, unfortunately we have learned from experience in the two years since the Treaty came into force that the Council and, in some cases, the Commission continue to deliberately – or so I believe – put up obstacles in an attempt to prevent Parliament from exercising its new prerogatives. This is unacceptable. Parliament cannot accept under any circumstances that the Council should continue to operate as if nothing had changed, as if Parliament were a mere bystander and the Treaty of Lisbon and the new division of competences had never existed. Minister, Commissioner, whether you like it or not, Parliament cannot be excluded from making decisions on fisheries policy, whether internal or external. These are not my words, they are the Treaty’s. Now, once again, following the Commission’s proposal, the Council has sought to exceed the scope of Article 43(3) of the Treaty, quite unacceptably in our view, in an attempt to exclude Parliament’s voice from the decision-making process. The procedure laid down in this article clearly refers to the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, that is, decisions on TACs and quotas, and to these two aspects alone – not to a whole series of other measures for achieving the objectives of the common fisheries policy, which would be covered by Article 43(2). As is stated in the preamble to the question, technical measures, such as prohibition or restricted zones and periods, restricted fishing depths and specific requirements related to fishing gear can in no way be interpreted as falling under the remit of Article 43(3). Parliament’s position is quite clear. We have been stating it for some time now: you cannot take a broad interpretation which is in clear contradiction with any exceptional status. Our reaction, in various dossiers, has always been to seek proportionate measures. We clashed over the Venezuela–French Guiana dossier, when the Council decided to forge ahead without Parliament’s consent. We had no alternative than to go to the European Court of Justice. Also when we opposed the Council’s blocking of long-term plans for hake and anchovy; we disagreed and we chose the first reading to try to negotiate seriously with the Council for a second reading. In terms of TAC and quota regulations we have been even more tolerant, if that is possible. It has not escaped our attention that what was adopted in 2010 and 2011 – in both cases on the basis of Article 43(3) – was done incorrectly. We continued to insist that sufficient time should elapse before the Council and the Commission could take joint decisions and were operating correctly. However, now of course we realise that in this case they are introducing a recital on certain conditions, functionally linked to the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, when clearly the concept of associated conditions, formerly covered in Article 20 of the Regulation, has been explicitly omitted from the new Treaty. The Members of the European Parliament thought that we should allow some time to elapse. However, we are – and I say this clearly – most disappointed because in 2012, three years after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, there are still major discrepancies between what the Commission proposes and what the Council approve, on the one hand, and what the Regulation states on the other. In my view, neither institution has given any indication that it is willing to abandon this broad interpretation of Article 43(3) for once and for all, and adopt another procedure that is more respectful of Parliament’s prerogatives. To conclude, there is unanimity among groups, coordinators and all the Members. We have made our approach very clear in our oral questions and I would like the Commission and the Council to answer the questions we have put to them today just as clearly. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, the feelings of hundreds of thousands of farmers in many regions in Spain can be summed up in a simple but resounding word: ‘no’. We say ‘no’ to an unbalanced agreement; ‘no’ to an agreement without even a single guarantee that customs duties will be paid or fraud prevented; ‘no’ to an agreement that allows unfair competition against our farmers, inducing them to abandon their crops. In short, we say ‘no’ to the disappearance of fruit and vegetable farmers in regions such as Andalusia, Murcia and the Canary Islands. Our ‘no’ should not come as any surprise. It is a consistent ‘no’, just like our consistent ‘yes’ to the fishing agreement. We have not changed tack. We are defending today what we defended last July in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. We voted against then, and we will vote against once more on Thursday, because nothing has changed. However, we do not want anyone to see this as a ‘no’ against the Kingdom of Morocco, which is a preferential partner, and should continue to be one in the future. While Morocco may benefit from the European Commission’s inability to amend the regulation on entry prices, it is not responsible for it. I will finish by saying that our ‘no’ today is also a ‘yes’. It is a clear ‘yes’ to our farmers; a ‘yes’ to reciprocity and strict respect for agreements; a ‘yes’ to good relations between the European Union and third countries; a ‘yes’ to being able to continue farming; and lastly a ‘yes’ to differences being defined by quality, not by fraud. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is clear that something is wrong when we are debating an extension today, in the month of December, which ends in scarcely two months. Nonetheless, we are discussing an agreement that is important to the European Union and to Spain in particular, an agreement that cannot be used as an excuse for diverse claims that are not strictly fishing based, and one which I agree should be extended despite the fact that many aspects of the agreement are unsatisfactory. I have always defended agreements with third countries, and even more so with neighbouring countries and those of such importance as the Kingdom of Morocco. It is precisely for that reason that I hope that the extension will be ratified and that a new agreement is negotiated, which is balanced, fair and beneficial for all signatories and allows our fleet to continue working. I am confident that this agreement will be reached, and that, as well as being economically viable and guaranteeing the sustainability and conservation of resources, it will also have positive consequences for the signatories from a social and working perspective. However, I also robustly defend that the agreements must be respected and comprehensively fulfilled, and for that reason and to be consistent, I questioned the agreement with Morocco for the agricultural sector and I emphatically support the agreement for the fishing sector. We do not have anything against Morocco, quite the opposite, but this does not detract from the fact that we demand that the agreements are respected as is deserved by the citizens we represent. This Parliament should send a clear and open message to the Commission that they should negotiate and negotiate well, without delay and with transparency. Remember that poor negotiations always bring poor consequences. There are many examples. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, much has been said over recent days about the volcano on the island of El Hierro, in the Canary Islands. I was there last Friday and experienced for myself, along with the people of El Hierro, an earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale. I can assure you that it was not a pleasant situation to be in. However, it was even more unpleasant to see the situation in which the thousands of inhabitants of this small and very European island find themselves, with their lives determined by the volcano and continuous seismic activity. The tunnel linking the two main cities on the island is closed, people cannot go out to fish, and businesses are being closed down. People are seeing a major crisis grow to terrible proportions, and they can do nothing but wait. This wait is unsustainable from an economic perspective. Fishermen, farmers, small business owners, hoteliers and society as a whole all urgently need Europe’s assistance and economic support in order to tackle not only the present situation, but also an uncertain future. The European Union must be where it is needed. That place today, more than ever, is the island of El Hierro. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, it is precisely in situations of crisis that the efficiency of and confidence in institutions is seen. In this case, they have left much to be desired. The Commission has said precisely that suspicions about Spanish cucumbers have not been confirmed. No, Commissioner: what has been confirmed is that the suspicions were unfounded, irresponsible and without objective data; what has been confirmed is that there are 23 dead and that the Spanish horticultural sector has suffered enormous damage. What has also been confirmed is that the Commission must do what it has not done up to now, which is to act with conviction on various fronts: stop the outbreak; prevent unfounded suspicions from being given a glimmer of credibility, seriously affecting a Member State – in this case, Spain – by taking the necessary measures to achieve this; compensate the damage suffered without delay and restore to the Spanish brand its image of safe, very high quality agricultural products. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, the best thing about asking a question is that you get an answer, even if, in this case, it could be considered disappointing in some ways. The fisheries sector is clearly in crisis: fishers’ incomes are lower every day, making it difficult to continue working in this field in many cases. We are not talking about stealth subsidies or unsustainable practices: we are talking about problems that require our full support. We suggest it time and again, and reiterating a fair demand, as Mr Cadec has done, cannot be reproached: he is being consistent. Nobody has suggested increasing fishing efforts. We do not understand why measures that are immediately relevant to exceptional situations have to be rejected. We are just suggesting that the Commission not turn its back on a sector that urgently needs aid, and this aid can, today, be an increase in de minimis
 aid. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, the tomato growers of the Canary Islands, Murcia, Andalusia and the Community of Valencia, all of them European Union producers, need the Commission to take robust action with regard to an unfair situation which is causing them serious damage. Fraud is being committed, and you know it. Thanks to its agreement with the EU, Morocco benefits from an entry price to which it does not adhere. In addition, we should not only look at 2007, but also at 2010. The Commission is well aware that Spanish tomato growers have to compete with Moroccan growers under unfair conditions, as they must bear much higher production costs stemming from the strict European standards on quality, food safety and workplace safety, as well as restrictions on pesticides which are not required of third countries. Even so, our growers, with great effort and commitment to quality, continue to work hard to save their crops. Thus, it is unacceptable for the Commission to ignore the malfunctioning of the entry price regime, whose complexity encourages fraud, as the European Anti-Fraud Office itself does, and for the Commission to look the other way when the tomato quotas agreed with Morocco are being contravened. It is not enough for the Commission to tell us that surveillance is the responsibility of the Member States. If they fail in their duties, the Commission must act. It is intolerable for regulations on Moroccan import quotas to be breached, and for the applicable customs duties to go unpaid, without the Commission taking any action. The Commission would have us approve a new agreement with Morocco. Unless we are given assurances that the price system will be modified to prevent unfair competition between Moroccan and Spanish produce, we will certainly not be supporting that initiative. It is your obligation to ensure adherence to agreements, but it is also your obligation to defend the interests of growers in the Canary Islands, Murcia, Valencia, and Andalusia. Do it before it is too late. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Madam President, I would respectfully inform Mr Campbell Bannerman that his banana is not from the Canary Islands. Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to talk about bananas in this plenary sitting and I think that it is positive that bananas are being talked about here. It is positive because it is important to reiterate the need for EU banana producers to be protected, including those in the Canaries. I think this because I believe that the conclusion of the Geneva Agreement on Trade in Bananas is not good news for EU producers. Moreover, there are aspects of the resolution that we are debating today that are not completely satisfactory from the point of view of agriculture and of protecting EU banana producers. However, I am aware that this proposal originates with the Committee on International Trade, whose criteria relating to several issues are very different from those that I am able to have. I will therefore assess the positive aspects of the proposal and not the negative ones. It is positive that it brings to a close so many years of disputes in the World Trade Organisation, thus restoring tranquillity to a sector that needs certainty and stability for the future above all else. EU producers belong to the outermost regions, which have enormous problems producing bananas – or excellent-quality ones, anyway – and whose banana production is nothing like that in third countries in any respect, including in terms of cost, workforce, the environment or of plant protection safeguards. From an agricultural point of view, it is important to stress that the agreement is damaging to EU producers. We are facing drastic cuts in tariffs, from EUR 176 to EUR 114 per tonne and EUR 75 per tonne in the case of the agreements with Colombia and Peru. Therefore, Commissioner, with all due respect, I can tell you that it is not credible that there were provisions for this drop in tariffs in the financial detail of the 2006 Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), because it is not true. The Commissioner said that it was provided for in relation to the Geneva Agreement; let us bear in mind that this tariff is EUR 114. There could never have been provision in 2006 for the tariff to decrease to EUR 75 as there is following these agreements. I therefore believe that the necessary evaluations should be carried out and it will be confirmed that it is absolutely necessary for the financial details of the agreement to be updated because, inter alia
, the Commission already saw the tariff of EUR 176 per tonne itself as low when it was implemented. EU producers are not, therefore, asking for anything that is not wholly justified, and we in Parliament have an obligation to protect them, as does the Commission. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, in my speech, I am going to focus on two reports whose procedure and final results are an example of what to do and what not to do. I am referring to the plan for anchovy stocks and the use of exotic species in aquaculture. Regarding anchovies, an example of how not to do things, the subject has been under discussion for more than one year and, unfortunately, it has become a debate on the powers that the Treaty of Lisbon grants to Parliament and on the legal basis for the Commission proposal, rather than a debate on what is better for fishermen, industries and fisheries. It has been a long and futile debate, the victim of which has been the sector, which has looked on in astonishment as we have become lost in discussions while the long-awaited management plan has yet to move forward and is in danger of never seeing the light of day. People who work in the anchovy sector are rightly complaining about the administrative hindrances that this plan is facing, when it is so essential for avoiding further interruptions to the activities of this fishery. I sincerely believe that, given this background of uncertainty, the Commission should seek to send a positive signal to the sector today in Parliament. On the contrary, with regard to the use of exotic species, the agreement reached by Parliament at first reading is a good compromise. The Commission, the Council and Parliament have succeeded in reaching an agreement quickly and without major disagreements over law or fact. The agreement not only establishes a strict definition of closed aquaculture facilities, but also achieves greater legal clarity for the businesses in the sector and, more importantly, removes a piece of the bureaucracy that Europeans have had enough of. I am convinced that the administrative processes need to be reduced to an essential minimum. Europeans have to deal with excessive bureaucracy, which makes it extremely difficult to start up or operate any activity. Therefore, reports such as today’s that remove administrative procedures are not only good news for the aquaculture sector but should also be a constant feature of the way in which we work.

Madam President, I am also going to talk about Venezuela, because there are some people who do not understand that democracy is not just about casting votes. Democracy is being able to do so with security, freedom and equality, and in a democracy and under a system of freedoms, private property must also be respected. Unfortunately, at present in Venezuela, the public and their businesses are under threat. In this respect, I would like to mention one business, Agroisleña, which was founded by people from the Canary Islands and on which more than 1 000 families depend. It has been unfairly expropriated, and like so many other businesses, after many years of hard work, it is failing, following capricious decisions by those who think that anything goes. First, land was confiscated, now businesses are being confiscated, so who knows what will be next? It is time for the people of Venezuela to feel free and for businesspeople to no longer feel defenceless and permanently under threat. As has already been said, it is time for Venezuela to be a genuine democracy where there is no doubt that terrorists will not find refuge. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, if we are talking about territorial cohesion, we have to talk about islands, mountain regions and also the outermost regions. It means talking about their problems and difficulties, their natural disadvantages and their structural handicaps. However, it also fundamentally means talking about how we can remove the obstacles that prevent their development. It means talking about strategies for converting those disadvantages into opportunities. Improving connectivity, an adequate neighbourhood policy and stability in policies and in the Structural Funds are issues that we need to tackle without hesitation, on the basis of two major premises: territorial cohesion and the principle of solidarity. There are people who do not believe in strategies. I do believe in them, and this resolution should be proof of Parliament’s commitment to these regions and of its demand for the Commission to make political decisions that take into account the needs of these vulnerable areas, whose problems become even more harshly evident in times of economic crisis such as we are experiencing at the moment.

Madam President, it is two years and one month today since the air accident that claimed 154 victims at Barajas Airport, Madrid, and tore apart many families, most of which were in the Canary Islands. All Members share their pain. Unfortunately, today, two years later, the technical investigation has not been concluded. The victims’ families are still wondering what happened and they have no answers. I find this state of affairs regrettable for two fundamental reasons: firstly, because the victims’ families do not deserve it, and secondly, because important information that would be fundamental for air safety and could be essential to preventing further incidents is not coming to light. I trust that this regulation that we will adopt tomorrow will at least, among other things, help to speed up the technical investigation processes and to ensure that these situations are not repeated. I share the concerns expressed by my colleague, Mr de Grandes, and I congratulate the rapporteur on achieving an agreement at first reading, but I hope that we have not given in on too many things in order to satisfy certain interests: it is the victims that are important here and they come first. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, once again, we are going to talk about free trade agreements between the European Union and third countries. I have already spoken about the agreements with Colombia and Peru, which are extremely damaging to the banana industry in the Canary Islands, and today, I wish to talk about Morocco. On 16 September, the Commission adopted its proposal on a new agricultural chapter of the association agreement with Morocco: a proposal that increases the tomato quotas, maintains the October to May period instead of extending it to the whole year, and does not revise the entry price system which has been proven to be fraudulent, as recognised by The European Anti-Fraud Office itself. This agreement is lethal for EU producers, essentially in Andalusia, Murcia, Valencia and the Canary Islands, and the Commission is perfectly aware of that. The Commission cannot look the other way and propose a fresh agreement with no guarantees when the current agreement is being violated without any measures being taken. There needs to be an urgent review of the entry price system and I ask the Commission to undertake one without further delay. The Commission has an obligation to defend farmers, so defend them! Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Madam President, this is not the first time that I have spoken about Venezuela and the breaches of human rights that are occurring in that beautiful country and I fear it will not be the last. During my previous speech I referred to journalists. Today I am referring to judges such as Judge Afiuni, and as always to ordinary Venezuelans, who, like the thousands of canaries that live there, only want to live in peace and freedom. These people aspire to safeguard their land and their affairs without the permanent uncertainty of ‘what will happen tomorrow’. Venezuela has been a land of refuge for many. Today, unfortunately, it is a country where freedom of expression and other freedoms and rights are mere memories. We are talking here today about human rights and who is breaching them. May our support go out from here to Judge Afiuni, and to everyone living in Venezuela, together with our hope that political freedoms will once more be a reality. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with a reform that is simple but extremely important for the outermost regions. This is especially the case at a time when the crisis is affecting everyone, but is affecting these regions in a fundamental way, as they have permanent structural handicaps that mean that they need these changes. I am going to talk about the Canary Islands. In the case of the Canary Islands, the most important change is regarding supplies of milk-based preparations intended for industrial processing. We are talking about skimmed milk powder with vegetable fat, which is a traditional product for local consumers that has been sold in the Canary Islands for more than 40 years. After a great deal of effort and despite many difficulties, a local industry was established that generates employment and obvious added value. I would like to highlight this because, in the current times, particularly on our islands, which have extremely high unemployment, supporting a small industry that creates jobs is not only a necessity but an obligation. The proposal is to maintain the supply of this product, which is used for local consumption in small quantities of 800 tonnes per year. This would eliminate the transitional nature of the measure, which is of little importance in the global context, and therefore give stability to this industry. As I said before, the outermost regions have significant handicaps, but they must be considered an opportunity for Europe. The different association agreements that are being worked on and debated at the moment, such as the free trade agreements with Colombia and Peru and others on which negotiations are beginning, such as with Mercosur, are a clear threat to our agricultural sector. I am thinking about numerous products: tomatoes, bananas, and the livestock sector. I have said this many times: these agreements must achieve a balance, whereby everyone surrenders a little ground, so we all win. However, in no way must one product or one specific sector be forced to bear the cost of the agreements. Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Alves, and thank the Commission and the Council who, along with Parliament, have succeeded in reaching an agreement in this first trialogue on agriculture. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
).

 Madam President, I am going to talk about tourism, a fundamental sector for the Canary Islands, which receive around 12 million tourists per year. If there is one thing that tourism needs, it is certainty. Situations like the one that we have experienced – and which may be repeated – have dramatic consequences for this strategic sector for the Canary Islands. The losses have not only been suffered by the airlines, the airports and the tour operators: hotels, car hire companies, restaurants and services in general have suffered huge damage. Between 15 and 23 April alone, 313 818 aeroplane seats were cancelled in the Canary Islands, with losses of around EUR 57.3 million as a result of the tourists not coming. This is, of course, a significant loss. We need immediate measures when the event occurs, such as opening airports at night without additional costs and looking after the public, the passengers, properly; but we also need compensation. I am not going to criticise what was done or what was not done or say whether the crisis was managed well or not. It is only worth being aware that it could happen again and that we need to be prepared for it. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
).

Mr President, last week Europe missed a great opportunity: the opportunity to be the world leader in astrophysical research for the next twenty years. The European Southern Observatory decided, on the basis of reports which were far from transparent, that the European Very Large Telescope would be located in Chile and not in the Canaries. This is a time to congratulate Chile, but also to reflect on whether in Europe everything possible was done to have a European installation, decided on by a European institution, with European funding involving an investment of more than EUR 1 billion, located in Europe rather than in the Americas. The European Parliament was unanimous in its support for locating it in La Palma and I am grateful for that, but what did the Council do? What did the Spanish Presidency do? Did it hold any meetings with the Observatory? Did it hold any meetings with any of those Member States responsible for deciding on the location of the telescope? Did it really support the European bid? Europeans from La Palma, the Canaries and the rest of Europe are waiting for answers on this. At the moment they are left with the conviction that not everything was done that could have been done. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
).

 Mr President, although it is merely an administrative issue for certain people, for others it is much more. We are talking about freedom. I know that for some people freedom must be defended in certain ways and in certain places. However, I also know that for some people, true freedom, their own freedom, is one that is imposed by certain dictators whom they defend and in some cases they even encourage and not the freedom of people like us who defend this word to its fullest extent, who believe in free media and who believe that land cannot be taken by decree. You should ask the thousands of people from the Canary Islands who have been subjected to this situation in Venezuela. We are talking about rights, plurality and freedom. Unfortunately, certain people do not believe in this yet. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, last December, the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco entered into an agreement to liberalise trade in agricultural products. Unfortunately, the only information we have on the content of this agreement has been gleaned from the media. This information indicates an increase in the quota for tomatoes imported into the European Union, something we categorically reject, as the Kingdom of Morocco has repeatedly failed to honour its obligations to the European Union. The European Commission refuses to admit to the existence of this situation, even though OLAF itself has done so. We cannot allow the Commission to continue turning a blind eye, disregarding the needs of producers in the Canary Islands, Andalusia, Murcia and Alicante. We therefore appeal strongly for agreements to be honoured and for more attention to be paid to plant health controls. In addition, the timetable for Moroccan exports should be made more flexible, allowing exports to be spread across the entire year. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, the situation in the agricultural sector is not only of concern. I would call it unsustainable: farmers’ incomes are declining and every day there is a greater difference between what farmers receive and the market price for consumers. Succession is already a Utopia, and association agreements are repeatedly infringed, as in the shameful case of tomatoes from Morocco, a situation that has been recognised by the European Anti-Fraud Office with no decisive action by the Commission. Plant health rules and controls are applied to varying degrees, creating entirely unfair situations. If we add to this isolated cases, such as the decrease in duty for the banana sector, which is going to have entirely negative consequences, or the fact that it is impossible for livestock farmers to afford input costs, you will agree with me that the future of the sector is, at the very least, uncertain. Moreover, for agriculture in the most remote regions, the future is not only uncertain but extremely worrying. Farmers want to continue farming, but it is becoming more difficult for them every day. The Commission must accept the importance of agriculture. Face up to it boldly! Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, agreements should be honoured and rules should bind everyone equally. This statement, which may seem obvious, is not so obvious in reality when we are talking about the Association Agreement between the European Union and Morocco, which contains consistent irregularities, as recognised by the European Anti-Fraud Office. Spanish tomato producers, particularly in the Canary Islands, are going through a difficult time, and need the agreement to be honoured, but also want to know what the Commission plans to do about the new agreement that is still being negotiated: whether an increase has been offered in the preferential tomato quota and under what terms, whether the entry price system is going to be changed to prevent further breaches in the future, and whether the plant health requirements demanded of European producers are going to be enforced. Also, while we are talking about agreements, banana producers are also following negotiations, in some cases bilateral negotiations with third countries, with a great deal of concern, because such dealings could have irreparable consequences if they do not go hand in hand with compensatory measures. In both cases, the Commission cannot abandon its producers and we cannot allow that to happen. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, a fire is always a tragedy, a tragedy for people, a tragedy for the environment, an economic and social tragedy. I had the misfortune to live very close to this tragedy, to the fire that took place this summer on the island of La Palma in the Canaries. I therefore welcome this resolution and I am convinced that we are going to be able to adopt it unanimously. It is a complete resolution, which has received many contributions and which, above all, does something important. First of all, it remembers the victims, all the victims, and pays tribute to all those who work voluntarily to put the fires out. However, it also includes some significant reflections on the importance of drought and desertification in the spread of the fires, and the resulting disappearance of hundreds of thousands of hectares per year. There are also important reflections on the causes that aggravate the fires, such as the gradual abandonment of the countryside, deficient maintenance of the forests and inadequate punishment for arsonists. In this respect, we need to act and we need to act firmly. The Commission needs to draw up a risk prevention strategy and an effective strategy for combating natural disasters, and a protocol for uniform action. However, aid is also important, for restoration, for re-establishing production potential and for compensating for the social costs and job losses. As the Commissioner said, coordination is vital. However, there needs to be coordination between the different Community instruments: the Structural Funds, the Solidarity Fund – which clearly needs to be reformed – and their flexibility, and also instruments such as Aid Plus and, of course, the rapid response mechanism that we have already discussed. We need to go further in solving these problems, and I sincerely believe that this resolution is the right way to do so. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I believe that the thing we politicians must be able to tackle is unforeseen circumstances. I believe the European Council tackled the unforeseen, and I think it did well – and I say this standing alongside my friend Mr Atkins – in not giving in to Mr Cameron’s blackmail. I also believe it did well in seeking an alternative solution, the intergovernmental treaty. Sometimes, God moves in mysterious ways. We have an intergovernmental treaty that will be easier to approve than the reform of Article 48, and which will come into force sooner. The crux of the matter – and I am addressing the President of the European Council, my friend Herman Van Rompuy – is to do it quickly and for Parliament to be involved in the exercise. This seems fundamental because, returning to the metaphor of the lunch used previously by Mr Verhofstadt, I believe that if the European Council makes this lunch without Parliament, there will be no dessert.

 Mr President, President of the Commission, today was an important day, and Mr Barroso’s speech was an important one. I think you have achieved a good result, because you have established the three Cs: courage, credibility and confidence. It has been said here that the Community method is antiquated. However, the Community method has brought us many years of peace and prosperity. The Commission plays a vital role in that method; indeed, it lies at the very heart of it. It is therefore very significant that today, at this time of crisis and confusion when our people are asking for guidance, the President of the European Commission has made such a committed speech. Mr Barroso, you can count on Parliament’s political support when those commitments are turned into initiatives. I offer you my congratulations. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Madam President, I do not think this is the first debate we have held on this topic in Parliament. We had it in 2008, 2010 was the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion when we put forward a written declaration, and we are now putting an oral question to the Commission. What I mean is that, firstly, Parliament has always been concerned about this problem, which is a real one, because one often hears it said that we are preoccupied with institutional issues in which people are not interested. Institutional issues are important, but the issue of poverty is a genuine one and those of us who are present here tonight are demonstrating our concern. Secondly, it is true that – as the Commissioner has said – the action plans are essentially national plans. This is so. However, it is true that we can also do things at a European level. We did this – as Ms Berès will recall – when, at the insistence of this Parliament, we included the reference to social exclusion in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the struggle against poverty among the EU’s goals. I believe that very soon, we shall have the opportunity to take concrete action. I am referring to the debate and vote on the European Union budgets. These will take place very shortly and I think this will be an opportunity for demonstrating our commitment. The third point I should like to make, Madam President, is that it is very important to combat social exclusion and to combat poverty, but it is even more important to respect human dignity. A person suffering from poverty is one who possesses all the fundamental human rights, and we need to recognise this. Recently, I watched a film on Father Brezinski which I would recommend that my colleagues see, because this film demonstrates that the fight against inequalities is closely linked to the fight for dignity. Finally, Madam President, I would not wish to overlook one fact. From certain speeches, it would seem as if the defence of the European social model were the exclusive heritage of one particular political group in this Chamber. This is not the case. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and in all groups place great importance on the European social model, because this defines us, and because this is part of our identity. Therefore, I think that together – and both this question and the resolution show this – we will continue to fight for it to remain so. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

 Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon grants Parliament the power to initiate a reform of the Electoral Act, and therefore we have to do so. We also have to do so because, soon, the MEP seats in Parliament will be redistributed with the entry of Croatia. Therefore, the report by Mr Duff, whom I want to congratulate for the work he has done, is included in this field. The Electoral Act, as you know, dates back to 1976. A great deal of time has elapsed since then, and we therefore need to improve it. The debate taking place today is likely to focus on the pan-European list, and I say pan-European because my group has tabled an amendment along these lines that we will uphold, with all the more reason today, in honour of the recently deceased Archduke Otto von Habsburg, who used the term ‘Pan-Europe’. The pan-European list appears to raise serious doubts. Some people are telling us, ‘It is too soon.’ However, I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, that on 8 May 1950, an advisor told Chancellor Adenauer or Mr Schuman, ‘Minister, Chancellor, it is too early to make a Franco-German agreement to pool coal and steel.’ For conservatives, everything is always too soon. For those who want nothing to change, it is always too soon. For those of us in favour of progress, those who want Europe to move forward, we want to have high hopes, Madam President. One of William Faulkner’s characters said, in a very glorious way, ‘Our dreams must be like mountains so that, wherever we are, we can see them and pursue them.’ The transnational, pan-European list fits into this idea of dreams, ideals, poetry and struggle. Madam President, the style of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is to have the greatest possible consensus. We will seek the consensus needed to introduce it here. Nevertheless, as Paul Valéry said about every poem, ‘It is never finished; only abandoned.’ Today we are abandoning it, but we will come back to it, Madam President. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
). 
 – Madam President, Mr Kožušník, who is no longer here, said of my speech that I was in the mountains. Maybe, but I prefer to be in the mountains than to be in the past.  (FR)
 My colleague, Mrs Auconie, and Mr Kožušník, expressed how hard it is to explain to their constituents why we are dealing with institutional matters rather than real-life issues. It was a Frenchman, Jean Monnet, who explained that politics needs institutions. Commissioner, before this debate, we held another debate today on the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union. Let me tell you that with a little intelligence and ingenuity, anything is possible. At the end of the day, in response to the argument that the transnational European list would disadvantage the smaller States, we need to remember that the Presidents of the Commission have included Gaston Thorn and Jacques Santer. Mr Juncker is the President of the Euro Group. Are they from large countries? Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Mr President, when I first entered this House 20 years ago, this debate would not have taken place, because this House was a consultative parliament at the time, and many of us have battled over the last 20 years to make it what it is today, a co-legislator parliament. However, when one co-legislates, one must be responsible. It is an exercise in responsibility that is now in need. A part of this House has adopted the old May 1968 slogan, according to which it is realistic to demand the impossible. Obviously, if one demands the impossible, it ultimately becomes impossible to agree on anything. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has not negotiated with any individual groups. We have negotiated with all the groups. However, we have only reached agreements with those that were ready to do so. Mr President, it is my belief that much progress has undeniably been made with the Commission’s proposal, the Council’s position and what is now on the table – which will be put to the vote tomorrow – if they are examined objectively. This is the real controversy or dilemma that we will have to resolve tomorrow. At the end of his fruitful existence, Miguel de Cervantes said that there were moments in life when one must choose whether to be a road or an inn. By being an inn, Cervantes meant lying still, complaining that one is ignored and remaining static. Being a road means moving forward, overcoming obstacles, knowing that not all has been achieved, that the road is probably not the one we would like to be walking on, but going on walking all the same. This is what I believe this House should do tomorrow: walk on, resolve the differences we still have with the Council, but look towards a time when the crisis is hitting all Europeans. It is not responsible at this juncture to say ‘I am not happy with this, goodbye, have a nice day’. Responsibility means walking. Therefore, Mr President, I think that in tomorrow’s vote we will convene another meeting with the Council to be held in July. As another poet used to say – Mr Sosa Wagner has quoted a German poet, I will quote a French one, Paul Valéry – poems are never finished, they are simply abandoned. We will abandon the end result until July, and I hope that the Hungarian Presidency, which has proved so successful, will also be able to reach an agreement that satisfies everyone. Thank you, Mr President, and may I point out that this is the first time in 20 years that the clock has erred in my favour, giving me more time. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Mr President, we will not be going ahead with the vote on the Brok-Gualtieri report this morning: we will do it during the Brussels sitting. We will do it then in order to give Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri time to negotiate the conditions for applying Article 136 with the European Council. We are doing so because, as Mr Leinen said, the European Parliament is also der Hüter der Verträge
 – the guardian of the Treaties – and because we want the euro to function with everyone involved and with everyone committed; in the end, Mr President, we want it to be effective. That is what we asked for. It is not about any dispute between the institutions. It is not about gaining power for Parliament. It is about the result – the mechanism resulting from this – being effective for the European public. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,

Madam President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is going to vote enthusiastically in favour of this report, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council on this agreement. Ladies and gentlemen, in the 1980s we coined the phrase ‘democratic deficit’. By this we meant that in the European Union decisions were taken only by the Council of Ministers, based on Commission proposals, and that Parliament was only consulted. Parliament has been battling since the 1980s, through the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, the Constitutional Treaty and the Treaty of Lisbon, to close that democratic deficit, and I believe that through the Treaty of Lisbon, with Parliament’s new powers and the participation of national parliaments, we have achieved that objective. We are adding to that achievement today through this citizens’ initiative, which in the work of the Convention was due to the sound cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament. I would like to recall the following names here today: Jürgen Meyer, our German Social Democrat colleague, and Alain Lamassoure, who were responsible for bringing this initiative to the plenary of the Convention and getting it approved. I therefore believe that we have completed the circle, Madam President. I believe that today, when we adopt this initiative, we will have signed the death warrant of the idea of a ‘democratic deficit’. Now it is up to us to act responsibly, ladies and gentlemen, and today we also have the opportunity to do so. By adopting the Union budget we will be fulfilling the role that is expected of us: as a responsible Parliament with codecision powers. Ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is a good day for Europe. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,

Madam President, I joined Parliament 18 years ago now. Then, the European Parliament was a consultative parliament. It was a parliament that did not have any powers. In this process over the past 18 years, we have seen Parliament change from a consultative parliament to a fully colegislative one. Our good friend, Francisco Lucas Pires, who witnessed this process, said that it changed from a deliberative parliament to a legislative parliament. Therefore, the text that we are going to adopt on Wednesday is the culmination of negotiations between the Commission and Parliament on the framework agreement. I confess that when I tell my family that I am going to Strasbourg to take part in the debate on the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission, I have to give them quite a lengthy explanation. This is because, obviously, these things do not exist in national parliaments or at national level, so people do not understand why an agreement has to be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to implement what the treaties say. However, it does have to be done. It has to be done for a very basic reason, which Mr Rangel and Mr Šefčovič have already stated: because we want to be efficient. What the framework agreement is essentially seeking to do is to resolve all the practical obstacles that could arise in terms of legislation, parliamentary control and codes of conduct. I therefore believe that it is a good blend of European democracy. It is ‘consensual’ democracy rather than the ‘conflictive’ democracy that we have in our countries. In consensual democracy, the intelligent thing to do is to find solutions to any problems that could arise. Therefore, the framework agreement is an instrument for preventing future problems and making what the treaties say a reality. As we have a new treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, it makes sense to implement it. I would like to congratulate Mr Rangel and the team that he led, and the European Commission, because I believe that they have reached a very reasonable agreement. When reading the content of the agreement, one cannot fail to be surprised at the voices being heard in some national parliaments questioning whether it poses a threat to the Council’s powers. For goodness’ sake! The Council is indeed the other colegislator. We do want to legislate, and we are legislating a great deal and successfully with the Council of Ministers. We are colegislators on an equal footing. We do not need to gain any sort of small advantage. What we want is for this to be effective, and I believe that the agreement is going to help to achieve this. Allow me to say, Mr Šefčovič, that you took the bull by the horns – a very bullfighting-related expression in my country – when you said that the interpretation of Articles 6 and 7 of the resolution is Parliament’s interpretation in relation to international agreements and international conferences. I do not believe there is anything strange here. What we are talking about here is Parliament being informed and participating through the Commission and through negotiation, nothing more. What is the purpose? The purpose is for us to know what the Commission has done when we have to adopt it here. Therefore – and I will finish here Madam President – congratulations to both of you. I believe that this is a good omen: as they would say in Casablanca, 
‘the beginning of a beautiful friendship’. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, on 14 February 2008, as a Valentine’s gift, the Conference of Presidents decided that the intergroups would only meet on Thursdays. Since then, we have been trying to resolve this issue. We have not managed to do so. Now the intergroups have to meet on an unsuitable date. They almost never have rooms and they never have interpretation. I am speaking today not only as the Chair of the Intergroup on Poverty and Human Rights, but with a mandate from the majority of the intergroups in this House, and therefore from the Members of this House who are part of those intergroups. I formally ask the Conference of Presidents to reconsider and to revoke the decision of 14 February 2008, going back to the previous situation of giving freedom to the intergroups. If it does not do so, I would like to say respectfully that we will bring the matter to Parliament’s plenary session, which will decide who is sovereign in this House, which is Parliament.

Mr President, Mr Leterme, I would congratulate you on your speech: it was an excellent presentation of this Presidency. I believe that we can already draw one, or even more than one, conclusion from this morning’s debate: firstly, that this House – those of us who want to build Europe, those of us who want to think positively about Europe – supports your Presidency and supports the efforts that you will be making. Furthermore, being aware of the difficulties within your government, I would like to thank you doubly, as it is all the more difficult for you to have come here today with this ambitious programme. We offer you our heartfelt thanks. Secondly, concentrate on resolving the economic issues. I believe that we have a great opportunity at the moment. I believe that we are on the point of reaching agreement on the issues relating to financial supervision. Concentrate on that. Thirdly, make the Trio work. I believe that the Trio of Presidencies is the great innovation of the Treaty of Lisbon. Let it not be a gimmick, let it be a reality, and let us do what the founding fathers said: think and act – in this case, Spaniards, Belgians and Hungarians – as Europeans. Thank you very much, Mr Leterme, and good luck! Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,

 Madam President, I believe that there can only be two solutions for resolving the financial crisis that we have experienced: either we give more powers to national supervisors, or we create a European supervisor and give powers to it. I am glad, Madam President, that at this moment, Parliament is firmly committed, politically committed, to European supervision, and I believe that there is great consensus on this among all political groupings. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs will support, and has supported, all institutional measures that move in this direction. It seems to me at the moment, Madam President, that once this commitment becomes manifest tomorrow, the Commission has a first order function in negotiations with the Council. During these negotiations, it seems to me that the key point will be whether these European authorities will be able to deal with companies affected directly at national level if the national supervisor is not involved. Therefore, Commissioner, the best of luck with this task, which I believe to be a determining factor for the future of supervision and capital, at this time, for those of us who would like more Europe.

Mr President, when you attended a meeting of the European Economic and Social Committee, Mr Van Rompuy, you used a beautiful image. You said that in the economic and financial crisis, we had wanted to build life rafts during the voyage. This was indeed the case, as the Economic and Financial Affairs Council that preceded the last European Council meeting took certain measures that were unthinkable in some countries, one of which I know very well. What we therefore need to do is ensure that this does not happen again in the future and therefore, that we build the life rafts in advance. I listened very carefully to what you said. You mentioned ‘a strict supervision of the national budgets’. I agree. Then, however, you added that there was no question whatsoever of the Commission supervising the national budgets before they were approved by the national parliaments. Well, I heard you say this to Commissioner Rehn. Moreover, I think it is a good idea and one that we should explore. ‘De l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace
’, as a French revolutionary would say. I have no problem at all, President Van Rompuy, with being under the protection of the European Union. I prefer to be under the protection of the European Union than under the protection of rulers whose method of government involves constantly changing course and improvising. We are therefore going to pursue any possibilities that we have. Secondly, it has been said here by some Members that as they are not in the euro, they do not care what happens to the euro. Well, I am concerned about what happens to the national currencies that are not in the euro, because that is being European. If, at any point, those currencies are in difficulties, it will concern me, because they will affect the economy that belongs to all of us. Mr President, one last aside. I know that, in times of crisis, it is more difficult to talk about fighting poverty, because there are fewer resources. I believe, however, that what has made us greater as Europeans is fighting against social exclusion and poverty. I ask that 2010, which is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, should not be simply one more conclusion of the European Council. President of the Commission, let us make active policies in this area. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Madam President, more than 20 years ago – in fact 23 years ago – I was fortunate enough to witness the signing of an agreement in the other parliament building between the then President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, and the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Marcelino Oreja, for what were then the European Communities to sign up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. That was 23 years ago. This reminds me of the answer that the poet Heinrich Heine gave when he was asked, ‘Where would you like to die?’ He replied, ‘In England, because there everything happens 100 years later’. Based on some speeches that we have heard, it seems that everything happens 200 years later, Madam President. I trust, however, that Mr Duff’s influence in the new Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition government will improve this situation. Therefore, Madam President, my Group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), has been in favour of this accession for a long time now, and we warmly welcome the excellent report by Mr Jáuregui. It is his first report and I am sure that it will not be his last. We are doing so because we feel that it will increase guarantees for the public, because what we are doing is giving more guarantees to people that the European Union legislation applied by the Member States and European Union laws is in line with the set of rights recognised in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. This report opens the way for resolving many of the technical legal problems that are going to arise, because we must not forget that the convention was designed to be ratified and applied by Member States. Whatever the propaganda from some sides of this House, the European Union is not a state or a super-state. It is an international organisation, and therefore, there are difficulties in adjusting an international organisation to something that was made for states. Mrs Giannakou, who was our shadow rapporteur and did an excellent job for which I sincerely thank her, will talk about the specific issues. All I want to do now is join Vice-President Reding in calling for the Council to give the Commission a mandate to negotiate swiftly, and I am sure that my friend, Mr López Garrido, will ensure that this is the case. This will mean, Madam President, that soon we will be able to celebrate the European Union signing up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, I would like to clarify two things. Firstly, the articles that are in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that are also in the European Convention on Human Rights are the same and mean the same thing: Articles 52 and 53 of the Charter; there is therefore no contradiction. Secondly, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights is supranational. Therefore, if someone wants to apply to it due to a European Union decision or the application of Union law, they will first have to apply to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling. I understand that Europhobes always want to vote against Europe, but at least out of parliamentary courtesy, they should read Mr Jáuregui’s report, which sets everything out clearly. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, please allow me to begin my speech with a line from Rilke: ‘Herr, es ist Zeit. Der Sommer war sehr groß...
’.
 Rilke was the favourite poet of our recently deceased fellow Member, Dimitris Tsatsos. Some time ago now, on 19 November 1997, Dimitris Tsatsos and I had the honour of submitting the report on the Treaty of Amsterdam to this House. It was in that very report on the Treaty of Amsterdam that we proposed that any amendment to Treaties be prepared beforehand by a Convention. We called that the Community method. Indeed, it is that Convention method that was used in preparing the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, above all, the Constitutional Treaty. I wish to remember Dimitris Tsatsos today in particular, as we are on the threshold of carrying out the first reform of the Treaty of Lisbon, which, in the last analysis, Mr President, is the Constitutional Treaty for which we fought so hard. That first reform, which is going to consist of the amendment of Protocol (No 36) of the Treaty of Lisbon, is caused by an anomaly because, at the time the elections to this Parliament were held in June last year, the Treaty of Lisbon had not come into force owing to the vicissitudes with which we are all familiar. Consequently, the last parliamentary elections were held under the Treaty of Nice, which was in force at that time, and said Treaty of Nice provides for the existence of 736 MEPs, as opposed to the 751 provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. To complicate matters even further, Mr President, the 1976 Act lays down that an MEP’s mandate lasts for five years. This means that we cannot now simply apply the number laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely the 751 MEPs, given that under Lisbon a certain country loses three Members who have been elected and, therefore, cannot leave Parliament during this parliamentary term. That, Mr President, is why Protocol (No 36) has to be amended in order to enable the Lisbon agreements to come into force, and why during this parliamentary term, 2009-2014, when the amendment of Protocol (No 36) comes into force, this Parliament will, exceptionally, have 754 Members. That is why, Mr President, the European Council addressed a letter to you asking that, in accordance with Article 48(2) of the Treaty, this Parliament give its opinion on two questions. The first question is whether or not a Convention is necessary in order to prepare the amendment to Protocol (No 36). The second is whether or not the Heads of State or Government can call an Intergovernmental Conference to amend Protocol (No 36). Both questions are linked, although they are dealt with in two different reports. I will begin with the calling of an Intergovernmental Conference. As I have said, we are dealing with the political result of applying the Treaty of Lisbon and we are also dealing with a transitional and exceptional solution that will only last for the duration of this parliamentary term. Therefore, that Intergovernmental Conference will confine itself to something that has already been agreed: how to distribute those 18 MEPs among 12 countries. Consequently, Mr President, there is no debate. I believe that the Intergovernmental Conference can be very quickly called and can even resolve the issue in a single morning, given that the political decision has already been taken. For that reason, I am going to ask for a ‘yes’ vote for an Intergovernmental Conference and say that I do not believe that a Convention is required for an issue that has already been resolved. We are in favour of holding the Intergovernmental Conference; we are against calling a Convention. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, when people coming from positions as different and far-removed as those of Mr Mauro, Mr Gollnisch and Mr Colman come to the conclusion that there are problems with the electoral procedure and systems for the election of MEPs to the European Parliament, it means that we need a uniform electoral procedure. That was a mandate that already existed in the Treaties of Rome. Therefore, we coordinators – and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them, most especially Mr Jáuregui and Mr Duff – have agreed on Amendment 2, which will be voted on tomorrow. I hope that this amendment will be supported by this House, particularly so that we can soon resolve this issue of a uniform electoral procedure for elections to the European Parliament. By means of this, we would, it seems to me, remove this type of question mark. In his speech, Mr Trzaskowski spoke about the necessary representativeness of this Parliament, something that the majority of the speakers and Vice-President Šefčovič, among others, have also highlighted. I agree. Indeed, we say as much in paragraph 1 of the report, to the extent that the 18 MEPs should enter en bloc
, otherwise we would lose representativeness. In order for them to enter en bloc
, in order to comply with this act of political justice that is the Treaty of Lisbon, we have to be practical, because a transitional and exceptional situation, ladies and gentlemen, also requires transitional and exceptional situations and solutions. This is why, and I am quite open about it, I do not like the possibility of MEPs joining this Parliament who were not elected in 2009, something which, by the way, I clearly state in paragraph 2 of the report. Nevertheless, if I have to choose between that and the 18 Members not taking their seats, or coming up with a practical solution and the 18 joining, meaning therefore that we comply with the Treaty of Lisbon, I ask this House, as I have already done in the report, to choose that solution; a transitional and pragmatic one but, above all, Madam President, a just one. I would like to thank everyone for their collaboration and for the interesting contributions that were made to this report. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,

 Mr President, it was in this very House, almost seven years ago, at the end of the constitutional convention, when we Members of the European Parliament and members of the national parliaments succeeded in putting forward a proposal that was accepted by the Presidium. I had the honour of taking it to the Presidium and we approved it. Furthermore, I wish to recall here the names of Mr Lamassoure and Mr Mayer, because it was they who drew up the Citizens’ Initiative proposal, a popular initiative that is today incorporated into the treaties. A popular initiative that is an example of participatory democracy – Mr Šefčovič has explained this very well – and of European democracy, because the issues that need to be covered by this initiative must be European issues, not local issues. Participation by citizens, therefore, and issues dealt with at European level. Mr Šefčovič, who is preparing this proposal, has not told us what it involves. He has left us with our mouths watering. On behalf of my group, Mr Šefčovič, I would ask that it contain at least three ideas. Firstly, that it should be clear and simple. In other words, do not let us make things complicated. It must be something accessible to the people, so that they can participate without having had to have gone to university. Secondly, that it should provide for cooperation between the European authorities and the national authorities, because, in my opinion, the national authorities must play an important role in the way signatures are organised. Thirdly, that we should educate, through the European Commission and through Parliament, by explaining how this legislative initiative may be used to avoid disappointments. I will give you an example of this that I saw on the Internet. An online petition has already been launched to use the popular initiative to make it possible to change the seat of Parliament so that there is only one. Well, this is impossible and we must say so from the start; it calls for reform in the treaties and cannot be dealt with by the popular initiative. There is, therefore, a lot of educating to be done, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, and of Parliament, in an initiative that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) endorses and hopes may serve to promote the sense of belonging to the Union and public participation in the Union’s business. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, I had the same concern as that expressed by the rapporteur. I think that in order for the vote to proceed properly on Wednesday, in the case of such an important report, we need to know in advance which amendments you consider to be inadmissible. I therefore accept what you said, and we would like to have them tomorrow. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would like to return to the subject of the admissibility of amendments, which you referred to before. Pursuant to Rule 157(3), it is up to you, but I would ask you, Mr President, to take into account the wise words of the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Casini. I do not think it can be left in the hands of the Parliament’s services to determine which amendments relate to the Treaty of Lisbon and which do not. Moreover, this House has the sovereign right to decide whether or not an amendment is necessary, at this time when, as everyone has said, a new phase is beginning. Mr President, I would ask you, therefore, to use the considerable power granted to you under the Rules of Procedure in moderation, and with your usual prudence. May you make the right decision, and may we all see it. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

Mr President, the President of the European Commission was saying that he congratulated Mr Reinfeldt on having brought the ship safely to harbour, the ship in question being the Treaty of Lisbon. Two years ago, in this House, I was saying that I was afraid that the Treaty of Lisbon might end up like the fish in The Old Man and the Sea,
 Hemingway’s novella, which, after a long battle, arrived at the harbour almost as a pile of bones. Well, I can see that the Treaty of Lisbon has not arrived at harbour as a pile of bones, but that its essence is still there. Thank you, Mr Reinfeldt; thank you, Cecilia. I must say, however, that I believe that what you have done, in seeking the agreement with the President of the Czech Republic, is right. Many of us in this House were troubled by the behaviour of the President of the Czech Republic, but there is a Spanish poet who says: ‘after everything, everything has been nothing’; in the end, the important thing is that the treaty is in force and that now we are thinking about the implementation of the treaty. Mr Barroso, it is not my intention either to give you any advice on how you ought to form your Commission, partly because I respect the autonomy and independence of the President of the Commission, who has received a substantial vote asking him to do this. When you present your college of Commissioners and the division of responsibilities, we will tell you whether we are for or against, but today, you have our full support. Neither do I intend to give any advice, clearly, to the President-in-Office of the Council, but, if you will permit me, I would like to point out to you something that happened during the work done on the constitutional treaty. In the first draft, which created the post of the President of the Council, there was a proposal that this Council President should be a prime minister who had been in office for at least two and a half years (as a joke, Mr Reinfeldt, we called it the ‘Bruton clause’, after John Bruton, because John told us that he had been prime minister for two years and seven months, and therefore would be eligible for the post). However, we later removed this condition – Mr Duff remembers – and we removed it because in this Parliament, we were asked what there was in the DNA of a prime minister that was not possessed by other mortals’ DNA. Why must the President of the Council be a prime minister? Mr Reinfeldt, you should rather seek out the person who can best represent moral authority, who can be the broker of agreements in Europe. In order to do this, we have given you a tool, Mr Reinfeldt: it is the fact that the election of this President of the Council does not have to be unanimous, but may be by qualified majority. Therefore, consensus is desirable, if it is possible; if not, use the qualified majority to seek out the best President of the Council. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).  
– Mr President, because the speaker was so kind as to agree to answer a question, I am going to ask one. Real Madrid, which is a Spanish football club, has got a flag and an anthem. Do you believe it is a state? (Laughter and applause) Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us imagine that tonight, when this interminable debate finishes, we go out and we meet 27 fellow Members downstairs and we have to decide unanimously which restaurant we are going to. If we negotiate this obstacle, then imagine that the 27 of us have to choose the same thing to eat, and that the 27 of us also have to decide whether or not to have wine. Mr President, this metaphor, which comes from someone who is on a diet, provides a good illustration of the current situation of the European Union and what the Treaty of Lisbon brings in: in my view, it is the most important thing, namely eliminating the requirement for unanimity. If those of us who have spoken here all want the European Union to function properly, to be effective, to produce added value for the people, then the first thing that needs to be done is to replace the requirement for unanimity with a requirement for super-qualified majorities. That is the most significant achievement of the Treaty of Lisbon. Opposing the Treaty of Lisbon means not wanting Europe to function properly or to have an important role in the world. Mr President, I do not understand, and it is a source of regret for me, how some fellow Members who have freely entered this Parliament can have more confidence in the Council of Ministers than in the European Parliament. In addition, these are people who will never be in the Council of Ministers. Why do they believe that their interests are better defended by the Council of Ministers than by this Parliament, where they are present and where they can vote? Mr President, another thing I do not understand is why a certain fellow Member said that what they want is to take their country – and this is a legitimate view – out of the European Union. In that case, ladies and gentlemen, it is necessary to be in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon, because the Treaty of Lisbon establishes, for the first time, an exit clause. Now, in truth, it is necessary to have the courage and the ambition to say to their people that it is necessary to leave the European Union. That is also something that I would like to see. Mr President, to sum up, I believe that through the result of the Irish referendum we are completing the process. Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Rouček and Mr Brok – who are concerned by the attitude of the President of the Czech Republic – that I have no doubts. I have no doubts because a person who refused to sign what had been adopted by the Chambers that elected him, a person who refused to sign the Treaty, would be like the Queen of England refusing to sign a law from Westminster. That is not possible. I am also certain that someone as patriotic as Mr Klaus would not want to see his country engulfed in an internal constitutional crisis. Mr President, I therefore believe that the time has come to join forces, for us to realise that the world is not waiting for us, the Europeans, and that either we Europeans must unite and maintain constructive positions regarding the problems that our citizens are experiencing at the moment, or else Europe, as a power, will disappear from the map. Mr President, that is what I believe that we must now do, in unity, as Europeans and as Parliament. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

Mr President, I believe that one of the conclusions of this debate is that when things are explained, when there is discussion with people, when there is communication, when lies are denied, then greater participation and greater backing for the European project are achieved. Therefore, I venture, along the lines of what many speakers have said, to make a positive, constructive contribution, and to ask the European Commission to consider whether, in the make-up of the new Commission, the duties of the Commissioner for Human Rights should not be included within a wider portfolio such as the Commissioner for Citizenship, to include communication, which is vitally necessary in order to be able to communicate well, to explain well, and to be able to begin a genuine dialogue on our European project.

 Mr President, the seriousness of the situation undoubtedly means that the forthcoming European Council to be held on 28 and 29 June will be perceived differently by Europeans, as a starting point in the efforts to build a new structure for the European Union. It cannot therefore simply involve the proposed freezing of a series of measures and initiatives that people do not understand. Instead, we need to be able to find sufficient symbols and unequivocal signs in this Council that a new era is dawning in the European Union. A plan needs to be decided upon, with a timetable and priorities, and, above all, short-term measures need to be as important as medium and long-term measures. We are all aware of the areas where action needs to be taken. The Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, has recently sent the President of the Council and the President of the Commission an action plan with five measures. What we wish to highlight, however, is the need for a new European structure that can bring an end to the instability and turbulence that we are currently experiencing. Jaime Mayor Oreja,

 Mr President, I shall not waste too much time describing the decision and procedures undertaken by the Argentine Government in its expropriation of YPF-Repsol. As I said yesterday, however, arbitrariness, legal uncertainty and illegitimacy are some of the terms that this decision merits. We are therefore facing a violation of rights and principles, appalling political and economic practice, and a worrying precedent, which means that this incident affects all Europeans. This is not, therefore, a dispute merely between Spain and Argentina. That is why today, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to stress what Europeans – the European institutions – can do, as well as why, what for and how, when this kind of decision is taken, which weakens the principles and, undoubtedly, the freedoms I have just mentioned, with the aim being that this type of action is never repeated. Allow me to express two ideas. The first is that in times and situations of crisis such as we are currently experiencing, the weaknesses of everyone, national governments and national institutions of the different countries, both inside and outside the EU, tend to increase; this is a reminder that the EU’s strength is its reason for being, and that the best instrument with which to alleviate the difficulties and weaknesses of the Member States should be the Union’s strength. That is the EU’s main purpose. My second idea is this: the crisis involves us all and is present in every European country; although it might appear momentarily that it is settling in one country or another, it is, in fact, our very model that is in crisis and, if it is not resolved, that crisis spreads slowly, gradually and systematically throughout all the countries. That is why one of the deep-rooted causes of this crisis is the EU’s lack of political ambition, and therefore the different manifestations of the crisis at hand should serve as opportunities so that the European voice can be clearly heard when this kind of injustice endangers the investments and future of the European institutions. I therefore welcome the determination shown by Mr Wammen, Mr Tajani, Baroness Ashton and Mr Barroso, who have proven that they are examining measures with which to tackle this situation. The more planned, strategic and organised measures we adopt, the greater and better our response will be to this crisis.

 Mr President, the climate crisis cannot be used as an argument to cover up an injustice of this kind. The fact that we are experiencing harmful climate change should in no way allow us to hide the injustices, arbitrariness and legal uncertainties that are taking place in a country such as Argentina. One day, we shall have the debate you want on climate change and – you are not really listening to me – on the crisis of values and principles that we are having in the EU and European countries. We can talk about climate change and the crisis of values whenever you like, but today we must address an injustice that is being carried out in Argentina, which is damaging European prospects and investments in the countries of that region. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, there is one principle that we should defend both inside and outside the European Union, and that is the principle of legal certainty. Arbitrariness is an aspect of this that we should be able to face up to and fight against, both inside and outside the European Union. When a decision is dominated by legal uncertainty and arbitrariness, that constitutes an unlawful action which affects thousands of small shareholders and which, most of all, sets a bad precedent for many European investments around the world. We therefore maintain that this debate is necessary and essential, not only for Spain and for a Spanish company, but also as a future reference for the many European investments made outside our borders. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

 Madam President, the European Council has adopted a series of measures covering governance, budgetary rationalisation, competitiveness and so on and I must say that they are all along the right lines. The European Council’s 16 points are largely due to the work of President Van Rompuy and President Barroso, to whom I first of all offer my congratulations, because I do value – some of us do value – what you have done as leaders of the institutions. However, the problem is that not only are we going through a financial crisis, we are also experiencing a crisis of confidence and a political crisis in Europe and in the European nations. The problem is not simply one of assessing the actual economic and technical contents of the European Council. At the same time as there are meetings of the European Council, European, national and regional elections are being held and all of these confirm our apprehensions. Extreme positions are being adopted. Some of these positions are currently taking refuge in forms of nationalism. Therefore, you must be very well aware that our problem is not simply to face up to the crisis, but to face up to the political and social consequences of that crisis. It is not simply a time when there is, as a fellow Member quite rightly said, a north-south crisis in the European Union. These are new times and a particular feature of new times is that crises mount up and proliferate and are not resolved. They turn up unexpectedly, both inside and outside the EU. Moreover, these new times basically demand new ways of thinking at both individual and institutional levels, and that is the major political challenge that faces us. Any change in one’s personal way of thinking starts with that person him or herself. First of all, if that person is a Member of this House, he or she must say in what ways Parliament must change if it is to deal with new times. The same goes for members of the Commission and the Council; each and every one of us must be able to face up to this issue. However, in any case, the main thing is not to go off course, because you are heading in the right direction. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

Mr President, the attacks that have recently taken place in Iraq and Egypt are evidence of two tragedies for Europe, albeit of a different nature. Firstly, it is a tragedy that the events themselves have taken place, due to their cruelty and the loss of human life. Secondly, however, it is also a tragedy to see how too often they go unnoticed in our society. In many cases, the way in which we act means that these events are confined to the accident and crime reports in the media, as if they were something external rather than an attack against us. It is as if they were happening somewhere else when, in fact, these attacks are taking place at the heart of and against the core of our civilisation, our Europe. The role of the European institutions is, fundamentally, to raise awareness regarding the seriousness, the significance and the scope of the attacks against Christians in these places. The European institutions should not only issue generic statements condemning these attacks, but should also promote action along two lines: firstly, ensuring that this tragedy is more present in our societies and our media, and secondly, ensuring that the European institutions are more present where the tragedy is taking place. With this objective and with these two lines of action, allow me to say, Baroness Ashton, that the European institutions and you yourself must promote the important role of the victims of these events. The victims need to be given faces. The victims need to be present in our European institutions. We need to prepare a programme of visits, meetings and even material support for the victims, but it is the victims of this terrible persecution themselves who will do much better than we can to defend their cause. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE

Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, these first six months following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon required and merited a change in political attitude. If the economic and financial crisis has been a consequence of the move away from the ‘real’ economy and the disordered development of the ‘unreal’ economy, the same can be said in a political context. On 20 January, in this Parliament, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero announced the four – not two – priorities of his Presidency: first, the common market for energy; second, investment in the information society; third, a sustainable economy or industry, with a plan for developing an electric vehicle; fourth, the completion of the Bologna higher education area. I ask myself, to what extent does this statement of objectives approach the reality that we have lived through? During his first speech, when he put forward his objectives, he did not mention the words ‘deficit’ or ‘debt’ once. The entire Presidency changed radically at the Ecofin meeting on 9 and 10 May of this year, and the euro crisis came to light. He continued to be late and unsuccessful. Necessary measures had to be improvised in the European Union due to the lack of foresight and depth in the diagnosis of the crisis. There was an additional difficulty: because of the results of his economic policy, the person holding the rotating Presidency was not in a position to participate in the leadership required for a solution, as he had become part of the problem. While rotating presidencies are, without a doubt, different following the treaty, in such an acute situation of economic crisis, either they assert themselves, or else they are even more limited and weighed down by the lack of confidence in, and the lack of credibility of, their economic policies within their respective countries, as in this case. Mr President, the greatest crisis that we politicians are living through is that of confidence. A crisis of confidence of such magnitude can only be resolved if we dare to tell the truth. We can find a description of the third fiction of this Presidency within this morning’s speech, in which it seemed that the President was only interested in extolling this Presidency. The question that we must ask ourselves is whether we will be capable of not going back to improvising or, instead, whether we will be able to diagnose and foresee the specific crisis scenario that will have a social dimension. (Applause) Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I believe that the worst crisis that we could suffer is not only the one that we are currently suffering, but the one that we will suffer if we are not capable of learning the right political lessons regarding what is happening. We have been living beyond our means, especially in some countries. We have moved away from the real economy and embraced the fictional economy, in our public accounts and, at the same time, in our family and private lives. We have not been capable of understanding that, as is the case for any living organism, growing is not the same thing as getting fat. Growth requires effort and proportion, while the process of getting fat involves a lack of proportion and balance in comparison with the work that we do and the welfare that we enjoy. This crisis does not remain static. The picture of the crisis a few months ago was a different one, a completely different one, to the picture that we have today. The picture of the crisis in a few months is going to be a different one to the picture that we have today. This crisis was economic and financial, and will have a growing social dimension involving social conflict. This means that while we are in this phase, before the conflict becomes a social one, those of us involved in politics need to be aware that our main crisis is a crisis of confidence. It is not only a crisis of the euro. Let us analyse all the political and electoral processes in recent months. There is a crisis of confidence, and that means that what we need to ask ourselves is how we need to change, how our attitude needs to change: our political, institutional and personal attitude. In this respect, instead of thinking about other institutions, the question that Parliament needs to ask itself is what contribution it can make to a change of institutional and political attitude in this House. I dare say that today, having heard many reasons for the crisis – bureaucracy, agencies, governments – there are two issues on which we need to change. Firstly, Europe requires a minimum level of cohesion from Parliament: it cannot bleed itself dry in such a profound debate on two concepts of European society. Secondly, we need to dare to tell the truth about what is happening to us. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE

Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to express my wholehearted, firm and unreserved support to Mr Barroso. This is based not only on what he has said today, but also on speeches he has made in Parliament that have encouraged us to support him more strongly and significantly than ever. I would like to say that the main reason for that support is not the number of Commissioners that our Group, or our political family, has in the Commission, but rather it is fundamentally the belief that this is a unique and distinct time for the European Union. This Commission is not just any Commission and this Parliament is not just any Parliament, not only because of the Treaty of Lisbon, but also because we are experiencing a crisis that is unprecedented in the European Union: an economic and social crisis. We do not think that the Treaty of Lisbon is the most important thing. The most important thing is for there to be a change of attitude in terms of steering all the European institutions towards greater political ambition. We therefore unreservedly support the Commission led by Mr Barroso. We also support the Commission because, whilst we are currently experiencing an economic and financial crisis, we are going to move onto another phase: the social crisis. The differences between some countries and others are going to increase, and there is going to be increased social unrest. The economic and social crisis is undoubtedly going to cause increased social unrest. Another reason is that we are experiencing a crisis of values, making it essential that all of us, not just the Commission, change our personal attitudes. We all need to change our attitude. Our Group therefore believes that the best way to change, to transform and to improve is to support the European Commission led by Mr Barroso. I therefore think that in the context of this task, and of the work that we have to do, the PPE Group is the group that wants us all to change the most. The European Parliament also needs to change. The Commission alone cannot be held responsible for the frequent lack of unity in this House, which is largely the reason why there is no European voice in the world. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

Mr President of the Spanish Government, I would like to say to you that we are not living in just another period, we are not living in just any moment in and for the European Union. What you and Chair Daul said is true: the European Union and the European people know that their main concern is the crisis. It also needs to be pointed out here today, however, that before the economic crisis, in various elections in which there was a low turnout, Europeans were also showing signs of a growing disinterest and distance from the European institutions. Therefore, the crisis of values has manifested itself before and also during the European integration project. I want to say this to you because, in view of the obvious impetus which will be provided by the Treaty of Lisbon, we have our first opportunity to reduce this rift between the European people and the European institutions. We are therefore living – or at least we should be living – in a period of transition and of change, which you referred to. I would like to say, however, that the first challenge that we have ahead of us is to be able to find the turning point in the process of Europeans becoming distanced from European policy. Transitions are always an opportunity. They are also a risk, but I obviously encourage you to have a small number of clear ideas that can always be communicated to all Europeans. I would therefore like to say that a change in attitude in all the European institutions, in all of us and in the national governments and parliaments, in politicians, is undoubtedly much more important than the Treaty of Lisbon itself. It is not enough for the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force in order for us to be able to talk about transition and change in the European Union and ambition in the European project. I therefore want to say to you that the prime ambition is for Europeans to understand us better, as they do not understand us. Our language is unintelligible and, at times, incomprehensible, and we therefore have to know how to say that this is a problem in itself and a challenge in itself, so that we can move closer to the European people. We need to devote much more time, much more political energy and much more political impetus to ensuring that Europeans can understand us. Ladies and gentlemen, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, all the presidencies are going to be distinct, different and more demanding, and they are going to demand more sacrifice and more generosity from us than ever. I therefore would like to say that I am very pleased to say here today that the Spanish Partido Popular
 has supported the objectives of the Spanish Government in the European Presidency at such an important time for the European Union. What we need to do now is to apply them in the right way. I am going to tell you how the Spanish Presidency should not be measured. It is not going to be measured by the number of meetings that we hold. The measure of a good Presidency is not conventional speeches or great words, or common places. It will be measured by the results, the realities, our capacity to change our attitude – in all the European institutions – and our capacity to prioritise the real problems that Europeans have. This will be the only way that we will truly move closer to all Europeans. (Applause) Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commission President, I want to make a preliminary comment. We cannot have the same debate after elections as before elections, out of respect for the elections and for the European people. We should not do things any differently from what happens in the national parliaments in this respect. If the European Commissioners are the result of a majority in each country, our main concern should be that the Commission President is faithful to what the European people have voted for in the European elections, hence the importance and correctness of Mr Barroso becoming Commission President. This is a strictly democratic principle. There are two points which Mr Barroso made and which I do not have any doubts in clearly and definitively supporting. The first is the extent of the diagnosis of the current situation, which he gave in his speech and comments. We are not only experiencing an economic and financial crisis, but also a crisis of values. This is the first time that I have heard in this House any confirmation of these characteristics. We are not only experiencing a crisis, but also a changing world. That is why, more than ever before, the emphasis must be placed on positive action by individuals and on a change of attitude towards the State and the markets, because we have probably lived beyond our means in many EU countries. The second point, which I also support, is Mr Barroso’s European ambition. Europe needs to elect, prioritise and organise, and the crisis and the Treaty of Lisbon are the two main issues on which the Commission President must particularly concentrate. Tackling the crisis requires a determined Commission and also a Parliament which is capable of tackling the serious circumstances that we are experiencing. The crisis is not yet over and its landscape is still unrecognisable. It is also forcing us to deal with social inequalities in the European Union. We therefore need the political ambition that you have shown this afternoon, Mr Barroso. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again the horrific images from the Middle East have shaken us all. More than 35 children were among the 140 victims in the Gaza Strip; six people have been executed as alleged Israeli collaborators; a number of Israeli citizens have also killed by hundreds of rockets made in Iran; there has been an attack against civilians today in Tel Aviv; 45 000 reserve troops have been mobilised; and a ceasefire seems to have been confirmed, or so Mr Cohn-Bendit has just told me, after frantic diplomatic activity: mediation by the President of Egypt; phone calls by the President of the United States; visit to the region by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and US Secretary of State; involvement of the Arab League ministers; French-Qatari plan; and threat of a resolution on Syria in the United Nations Security Council. Of course, Mr President, in this case words are not enough as the situation is so serious. There is a great deal of impotence and frustration after the trite condemnation of the Council of Ministers the day before yesterday, and I believe that the most important thing is to achieve, and consolidate, a ceasefire that is guaranteed by the United Nations, and that protects the civilian population and supports the moderates. We saw the alternative, Mr President, in 2008: 1 400 victims. We are only too aware that the circumstances are not the best: fragmentation and division within the Palestinian cause, elections in Israel in January and, of course, a nuclear escalation in Iran. Therefore, President-in-Office of the Council, what Europe must do is support unreservedly this ceasefire to prevent the worst from happening. However, we must not fool ourselves, Mr President, into thinking that there can be stability in the area, stability in the region, unless we tackle the deep-seated causes and injustices that are fuelling the hatred and violence in that troubled part of the Middle East. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, when the negotiating guidelines were adopted, the European Union – its 27 Member States, the Commission and this Parliament – had a commitment from Israel dating back to 2005.  Israel is a partner of the European Union and an essential participant in the peace process, even if we dislike the decisions that have been taken with regard to settlements and in spite of the fact that some of the decisions taken by the Israeli Government undeniably violate the rights of the Palestinian people.  After the elections in the United States, the peace process negotiations will be revived, and it is clear that the European Union cannot be excluded from this process. The European Union and this Parliament therefore need to honour their commitments and adopt this agreement.  Mr President, the interpretative amendment that has been tabled to the draft legislative resolution is clearly in violation of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, as Rule 83 states quite clearly that no amendments may be tabled to a draft legislative resolution.  Parliament is entitled to express its opinion through non-legislative resolutions and, in any case, the acceptance of this amendment sets a worrying precedent, which, if this decision is not reversed, is likely to be the subject of an appeal before the Court of Justice, leaving those who tabled and accepted the amendment in a sticky situation. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
).  
– (ES)
 Mr President, I would like to make a clarification concerning the oral amendment presented by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Normally, my group strictly fulfils the commitments that it signs at the negotiating table, and the terms of negotiation, Mr President, state that the European Union will take appropriate and responsible measures. Clearly, included in those measures are humanitarian measures, as was reflected in the debate that we had with Baroness Ashton the other day, concerning the situation in Syria. Therefore, the addition of this word is superfluous because it is already included in the terms. Mr President, my group is opposed to the inclusion of this word. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Brok, on this report on the state of the common foreign and security policy, which cannot be separated from the times that the EU is living in with regard to the debt crisis, the euro crisis and the crisis in European integration. Baroness Ashton, as a bloc we may be the leading global importer of goods and services, we may be the leading global exporter of goods and services, and we may be the leading donor of humanitarian aid, tripling the aid donated by the United States, but what credibility do we have on the international stage, despite your efforts and our own, if we are not capable of solving internal problems with due care and in an effective manner? The new European External Action Service and the new common foreign and security policy have come into being at the most complex time and in the deepest crisis the EU has experienced since it was founded. It is clear that if we want to have a coherent, visible and effective common foreign and security policy, we need to try to answer the questions raised by Mr Brok in his introduction. How do we defend human rights in an international community that considers our Charter of Fundamental Rights to be a westernised view of the world? How do we reconcile the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, laid down in the United Nations Charter, with the principle of the responsibility to protect in order to prevent crises such as that in Syria, which you, Baroness Ashton, said appalled you? How do we identify new partners in line with our world view and how do we work with them, and how do we meet the challenges raised by the Northern and Southern Neighbourhood Policy? It is a difficult task, Baroness Ashton, to solve our external problems, and that is not your responsibility alone, as we will see tomorrow in the debate on the state of the Union. We must start by doing our work internally. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (ES)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, in the previous debate, Baroness Ashton said that you were appalled by the situation in Syria, and I think we have run out of words to describe it, as has been said in other debates. Indignation, frustration, impotence, and meanwhile, the bloodbath continues in Syria. We should look at events, too: Kofi Annan’s resignation in a plan that was doomed to failure from the very beginning. And statements, so many statements: a statement by the new Special Envoy, saying that this is an almost impossible mission, which makes me wonder why he accepted it; a statement by the minister of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, saying that new sanctions are to be imposed on Syria; statements by the Swedish minister, saying that he does not believe sanctions are going to have any impact; statements by the French minister, saying that we need to put more pressure on Syria. In short, a lot of words and not much action. As you rightly said, Baroness Ashton, the situation is continuing as it has done for months, but with even more deaths. The regime is sheltering behind the complicity of Russia and China in the United Nations Security Council, and the opposition is winning support across the regional sphere, hoping that sooner or later, there will be international intervention. In the meantime, Baroness Ashton, I believe the time has come for the EU and regional actors to make a decision. I would like to ask you to answer some specific questions. Do you agree with the statement made by the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, who said the time has come to do something if the Security Council does not make any progress? Do you believe it is viable to establish humanitarian corridors? Do you think it is possible to establish a no-fly zone? Do you believe it is desirable and advisable to arm, support and help the opposition? Baroness Ashton, more than 20 000 dead people are looking to us, and we have to turn our words into actions. You have done a very good job of providing humanitarian aid, and continue to do so, but our purpose is not to be an International Red Cross. We want to have political leverage, with other actors, in order to stop this carnage. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, despite the financial crisis, I do not think we should forget that the European integration project is based on values: peace, understanding, harmony, reconciliation and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are part of the genetic code of the European Union. Not only are they part of the genetic code of the European Union, but they are also laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Among the institutions, surely Parliament is the one that is most committed to defending rights and fundamental freedoms and has a total and permanent commitment to the cause of human rights, which must not just apply to one region, country or continent, but which must be of a global or universal nature. Parliament has therefore given a Vice-President the responsibility for monitoring human rights; it has a body, which is the Subcommittee on Human Rights, as part of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET); it has created a new working group on democracy and electoral observation and there is always a section in its order of business dedicated to resolutions to defend human rights. Obviously, Parliament has distinguished itself by awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, which, as you know, was founded by a person who left a legacy promoting peace, respect, tolerance and peoples living together peacefully. Madam President, in this context, I am delighted to present this report which, in the form of recommendations, discusses the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights, and I would like to thank members of my political group for the prior work they have done and also thank the other political groups for their work and support. An important aspect, Baroness Ashton, is the mandate of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights. The representative must work to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, international justice and humanitarian law; to promote the abolition of the death penalty; and in all areas aimed at defending the causes of human rights’ defenders, fighting torture and impunity, defending women’s rights, child protection and the rights of minors, peace and security and, of course, the rejection of all forms of discrimination. The EU Special Representative must work very directly with Parliament and other international bodies, and must work in a context of visibility, flexibility and coherence with the historical aspects that I mentioned at the start of my speech, Madam President. The representative must be a person of broad experience, proven ability, international prestige and, of course, sufficient professional experience in the field of human rights. Obviously, Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Parliament does not seek to hijack the decision-making process for appointing this person, as it is up to the High Representative to make the proposal to the Council. However, in this context, I would like to highlight the particular importance of this appointment and the desire that, based on the trust and the mandate represented by the resolution that Parliament is going to adopt, you make the right appointment. This person is going to have a huge profile in defending this cause which, as I said, Parliament sees as a total and permanent commitment to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank some of my fellow Members for the work they did in advance to prepare this report and, of course, all those who have spoken in this debate. I note with satisfaction, Baroness Ashton, your firm commitment to ensuring that the EU Special Representative has a link with and works permanently and continuously with Parliament. Beyond the terms of the mandate, on which we have spoken extensively during this debate, and which, in my opinion, should also be applied to the interpretation of the democratic clause that we have with some third countries, there remains the question of the personal profile of the candidate. I was personally very pleased by the speech made by Mr Mitchell regarding the profile that this person should have, which brings to mind the anecdote sometimes told about when, in fourth century Athens, after the age of Pericles, Aristotle was walking with his pupils of the Peripatetic School and one of them made an observation that displeased his teacher. When Aristotle answered, the pupil said to him, ‘that is not my observation, but that of your teacher Plato’. Aristotle’s response has been repeated numerous times on the European stage from the fourth century BC to the present day and our technological and Internet era: ‘Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is the truth’. I believe that the Special Representative must be an integral part of the institutional structure of the European Union, report to the High Representative, have a link to Parliament and the Member States, but that what must be more dear to him or her must be the cause of defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, so that human rights and fundamental freedoms, as Parliament wishes, can take hold in the 21st century across the world. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus on the case of Syria. We have run out of adjectives to describe the deterioration of the situation there and the growing number of victims, including executed women and children. The words that best describe the way the international community feels are indignation and, of course, a feeling of frustration and powerlessness. It is clear that Kofi Annan’s plan has failed spectacularly and that we will need to think about other options. Keeping a minute’s silence – as occurred recently at the United Nations – and applying economic sanctions are hardly ways to overcome this situation. The Secretary General of the United Nations has said quite clearly that the President of Syria has entirely lost his legitimacy and that we cannot become accustomed to massacres being a daily occurrence. This situation and this conflict are dragging on too long, in my view, with the complicity, in particular, of a permanent member of the Security Council and of the Iranian regime. Baroness Ashton, a moment ago in this House, we had an extensive debate on the European Union’s role in defending rights and fundamental freedoms in the EU. Above and beyond our presence in the various contact groups, which is entirely justified, the EU has an obligation to put forward initiatives to bring an end to this situation and prevent the President of Syria from continuing to buy more time and massacring the opposition. It is also clear that the Syrian National Council must cooperate, and we hope that its new president, elected in Istanbul the other day, can unite the internal and external opposition. However, given the failure of diplomatic measures, there are not many options left open: humanitarian intervention, which is currently not possible due to the vetoes by Russia and China in the Security Council; political agreements with President al-Assad, which are continuing to result in him buying more time and cruelly repressing the opposition; or other mechanisms that would ultimately result in a civil war being sparked, which is already practically the case. Experience in neighbouring countries has shown us that, in order to try to bring an end to this situation in the short term, we need to seek political solutions to transfer power in the medium term. In this context, this solution is very difficult without a military presence and international troops. These are my questions, Baroness Ashton: do you ultimately think it will be possible to provide a military presence in order to try to respond and stop the dreadful conflict currently taking place in Syria? Who would be responsible for supplying those troops? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s debate in the House and the resolution that will be adopted afterwards, we wanted to highlight the importance of this association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine for the country’s European prospects, and as we have been reminded in this debate, a key element of the agreement is the democracy clause on respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, and respect for the rules of the democratic game. It is clear that the trial, conviction and humanitarian situation of Yulia Tymoshenko and of others blatantly violate the spirit and letter of this democratic clause. Parliament therefore must show its solidarity with these people, request that their rights be fully respected, strongly condemn the use of force, as has been observed, and, of course, ensure that opposition leaders can stand in the next elections, many of whom are currently in jail, like Yulia Tymoshenko. For that reason, I agree with what the Commissioner, Mr Füle said, in the sense that the signing of the association agreement cannot occur under these circumstances, and therefore, Parliament should not go ahead and ratify it. Secondly, without questioning the hosting of the European Football Championships, which is being organised jointly with Poland, I believe, and I am addressing you, Commissioner, that the European Union should try to give a joint response, given that we are supposed to be trying to establish a common foreign and security policy, as such that the representatives of the European Union and the Member States can act in a homogenous, joint manner from a shared standpoint. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we are debating an agreement between the European Union and Peru and Colombia, and speaking of human rights, Mr President, I would like Parliament to condemn the assassination of 12 members of the Colombian armed forces yesterday at the hands of the FARC terrorist organisation, 150 metres from the Venezuelan border. And I think, Mr President, that Parliament should convey its condemnation, warmth and solidarity to Colombian society as a whole and the victims’ families during these difficult times. The Commission has made it abundantly clear, Mr President, that we should not emphasise an ongoing dynamic of demands that has not been imposed on other countries that have signed up to agreements of this type. I think we should place emphasis on the fact that this agreement is a clear and predictable framework to try to overcome a regime of unilateral concessions, which I want to remind my colleagues already exists, is in force, and is going to affect trade, investments and services. And in this context, I am greatly surprised that many Members in this House state that they have doubts about this agreement, but that they do not have doubts about the human rights situation in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras or Nicaragua, with which the European Union has reached the same type of agreement, or in Mexico, where we all know about the rates of violence. What is true, Mr President, is that this agreement is going to put Peru and Colombia on an equal footing with other countries that benefit from the same facilities, as is clearly the case with Chile, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, Israel and the CARICOM nations. I believe, Mr President, that the European Union, its 27 Member States, the Commission, Peru and Colombia have signed this agreement, and I believe that we are falling into the trap of a paternalism exercise if we tell our partner countries what is good for them or what is no longer good for them. I think they are mature enough to know that they want this agreement because the European Union is a useful partner. And I believe, Mr President, that instead of considering introducing discriminatory and additional measures, what we have to do is to find out why, after almost two and a half years, Commissioner, this agreement has not yet been ratified. I do not think this situation paints the European Union in a good light and that, on the contrary, we should swiftly ratify it. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Mr President, I think we should congratulate ourselves on having made the decision to hold a debate and adopt a resolution. However, bearing in mind that Baroness Ashton will not be present in Parliament tomorrow due to a commitment she has with NATO defence ministers, I believe it would be appropriate to alter the agenda so that we could hear her speak, because she intends to make a statement on that very issue. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Howitt concerns human rights, including political, social and economic rights. That is why I should particularly like to thank you, Baroness Ashton, for the statement you made on the situation that has arisen in the Repsol company before we began our debate on this report. You said a great deal in a short time. You mentioned a wrong decision; a threat to investments and the future of Argentina; the need to comply with the commitments that were made; the measures you took to include this issue on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council; the postponement of the meeting of the EU-Argentina Joint Cooperation Committee; as well as analysing possible measures. With regard to Mr Howitt’s report, Madam President, I believe it is a reasonable report in general terms, although clearly some matters still need to be addressed, such as the decision to send a fact-finding mission to Gaza – which is a request that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) obviously cannot accept, as the rapporteur is well aware – and Mr Howitt’s position on Colombia, which is quite simply delusional. That amendment was already rejected in the vote taken in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and, for us, at a time when we are waiting for the Multipart Trade Agreement between Peru, Colombia and the European Union to be ratified, it is unacceptable. Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to highlight a fundamental aspect of our human rights policy, one with which Parliament has an irrevocable and unquestionable commitment. I am referring to the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. Parliament will vote on this issue in a resolution, and we would like the selection procedure for this individual to be objective, Baroness Ashton, so that the person appointed can truly have the merit and capability to fulfil this important role to the high level it certainly deserves.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, a threefold game is currently being played out in Syria. Several things are being determined: the influence that Iran and Saudi Arabia will have; the role that Egypt is going to play in the context of the Arab Spring; and the vacuum created by the election campaign in the United States, which China and Russia would both like to fill. The apparent good news is the unanimous adoption of this resolution in the United Nations Security Council. The important thing here, Mr President, is that the adoption of this resolution should be consistent with the attitude of those countries as regards the situation that has arisen in Syria. The path of diplomacy is slow to produce results, and meanwhile, Mr al-Assad is gaining time in order to continue repressing the population. The truth, Baroness Ashton, is that although we need to support Mr Annan’s plan, we are sending out mixed signals to the international community. On the one hand, Mr al-Assad remains in power, gaining time – for he knows that the veto by China and Russia enables him to massacre his population with impunity – and, on the other hand, we are sending out a message to dissidents that there is no short-term solution. It is therefore important, Mr President, that we should take all these factors into consideration; the EU deserves recognition for the action it has taken on humanitarian aid, the mobilisation of funds with Ms Georgieva, which you just mentioned, and its continued support for the deployment of this mission. However, as a diplomat from my country pointed out – and rightly so, I believe – according to the basis of Mr Annan’s plan, the solution to the conflict unfortunately has to begin with Mr al-Assad, but it also has to end with his removal.

 On behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we want to declare that our vote on the resolution on the European integration process of Kosovo is based on the fact that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it was a normal independent state, recognised by the international community, and does not take into account that the status of this territory continues to be controversial. It has yet to be recognised by a majority of countries, five of which are Member States of the European Union, including Spain. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, in the interests of achieving the broadest consensus possible, we believe that this resolution should receive wide support from this House, and so we propose an oral amendment to Amendment 5, in agreement with Mr Swoboda, Mr Verhofstadt and the other political groups. In the English version, this oral amendment consists of adding the words ‘strengthening and implementation’ after the word ‘introduction’, and the replacement of the word ‘condemns’ by the word ‘deplores’.

 Mr President, Mr Søvndal, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate on Russia is of great concern to us and forces us to choose between what is desirable and what is possible. The resolution that Parliament will have to vote on tomorrow addresses the very specific set of circumstances that have followed the presidential elections. We are faced with an official Russia which still harks back to the era of the Soviet Union and which feels entitled to veto freedom within the United Nations Security Council. This is a Russia where the President and the Prime Minister shamelessly take turns to be in power. A Russia where elections are not held in compliance with international standards, and a Russia where opposition figures are detained, which takes us back to the recent and far from glorious past. However, Mr President, this is also a Russia which is a member of the Council of Europe and of the World Trade Organisation, which duly collaborates with the OECD and wishes to become one of its members, and a Russia where, as in the Arab Spring countries, there are men and women who are fighting for their freedom and dignity. Mr President, I think what is central to this resolution is to work for change and to open a space for dialogue and conversation with the opposition whose rights have been infringed and ignored. We should leave until later, until Mr Swoboda’s report, the issue of the institutional framework, the new association agreement between the European Union and Russia, two entities that need to come to an understanding. Mr President, I think that from the viewpoint of the European Union – I would like to appeal to the President-in-Office of the Council and to the Commission’s representative – that we should mobilise all our efforts and influence to make what is desirable become possible, so that fundamental freedoms and the rights of all will soon become a reality throughout Russia.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, surely the deterioration of the political situation in Belarus, the problem of the political prisoners and the crisis that has arisen in relation to the EU ambassadors, which was analysed by the Foreign Affairs Council last Saturday, require that Parliament hold a debate on this issue. Therefore, Mr President, we call for a statement by the High Representative or, if she cannot be present, by the President-in-Office and, of course, by the Commissioner for Neighbourhood Policy and for a debate to take place. Accordingly, Mr President, we ask that, on the basis of this statement, this matter be included in the agenda, together with a debate and a resolution. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are three independent and developing factors affecting the Syrian crisis. Firstly, a kind of cold war between Saudi Arabia and, currently, Iran, which is becoming apparent on several fronts, and specifically in Syria at the moment, then, what is clearly a domino effect from the so-called ‘Arab Spring’, and finally, a greater desire on the part of China and Russia and other players in the Middle East conflict to make their presence felt and to fill the vacuum left by the European Union and the United States. We have followed the High Representative’s actions with a great deal of interest: suspension of development aid, humanitarian help, a contingency plan, the tightening of sanctions at the next Council of Ministers on 27 February, and support to the Arab League initiative. A more effective and coordinated diplomatic response from the Member States of the European Union was lacking, however. Unfortunately, none of those decisions has led to a short-term reduction in the intolerable violence that is being suffered by the Syrian people, hence the frustration we all share. The French Foreign Minister expressed that view today during an appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, in relation to the failure of the initiative and the Russian and Chinese vetoes in the United Nations Security Council. An initiative from Qatar and Saudi Arabia is being debated in the General Assembly as we speak, with the specific aim of ratifying the agreement, even though we know that it does not have any binding effects. What can we do about this situation? Increase the pressure on Russia and China, certainly. Two very appropriate occasions for doing so have arisen recently: one was the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of China to the United States, where he was received with full honours, and, of course, the EU-China Summit that has just taken place. It is also clear that we have to strengthen our relationship with the Syrian dissidents, and we have to see how this humanitarian corridor they have requested can be established and developed. In addition, it is clear is that the questions the Foreign Ministers of the Arab League asked themselves the other day also apply to us. How long are we going to remain impassive towards the violence that the Syrian people are currently suffering? Also, what is our tolerance limit when deadline after deadline passes, initiatives come and go, and the regime continues butchering the Syrian people? It is my belief, Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Secretary-General of the European External Action Service, that this is the key issue to be considered in today’s debate.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to bring up the matter of the El Universo
 newspaper in Ecuador. The facts are well known. The President of the Republic of Ecuador has brought criminal proceedings against the journalist, the newspaper and its owners because of the opinion that was expressed. The proceedings have led to a three-year sentence, given by two courts, and a fine of USD 40 million, which presents a serious threat to the newspaper’s very survival. A number of organisations have made reference to this matter, such as Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, and other international media and organisations working in the field of human rights. My question, Baroness Ashton, is very simple: are you aware of these facts? What is your opinion on the matter? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, as you are aware, Baroness Ashton, Ecuador is linked to the EU by a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement, which is based on the democratic clause and respect for fundamental rights, one of which is the right to freedom of expression. As you rightly said, on 10 February the Supreme Court will give its verdict on the appeal for this case; President Correa has said that he would be prepared to withdraw the court action if he is issued an apology. In addition to the concern you have expressed for freedom of expression in Ecuador, what would you be prepared to do in order to find a balanced, fair solution that respects the principle of freedom of expression?

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, on 23 January the Council took a difficult but consistent decision, and for that I congratulate Baroness Ashton. This Parliament will support the Council conclusions in the resolution we will vote on tomorrow. As you have just explained, it was difficult because it required sacrifices by several Member States, and it was consistent because it is in keeping with the positions we have defended so far. Both the President of France and the Prime Ministers of France and the United Kingdom have said that they will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. However, as well as being consistent, these measures need to be effective in order to promote the path of dialogue, bring Iran back to the negotiating table, ensure its full cooperation with the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and also, Baroness Ashton, to silence the drums of war that can be heard. Israel has said that all options are being considered, and one Republican candidate in the United States has said that swift action should be taken. Furthermore, some Iranian ministers have said that these sanctions will be ineffective, because the EU needs Iranian crude oil more that Iran needs the EU’s resources. What is more, the threat to close the Strait of Hormuz and the risk of escalating tension in the region could have serious repercussions for oil prices and further complicate the difficult economic situation we are going through. That is why, Baroness Ashton, I would like to say to you that, beyond the internal dimension and the consistency that were shown in the Council decisions of 23 January, it is also important to take action with our allies at this stage as regards our external scope and influence. You just told us that you visited India; the stance taken by India, Japan and other countries is vital to ensure that the measures adopted can have the effect that many of us are hoping for.

 Mr President, High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as Baroness Ashton has said, the situation in Syria is getting worse by the day, with an extremely high toll in terms of human life. You mentioned the figures released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: more than 4 000 people, of whom 1 000 are members of the security forces, and this augurs a bloody civil war in the country. Statements of condemnation have come from all sides – the United States, the European Council, the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union. However, Baroness Ashton, I believe that the time has come to move from words to action, because condemnation alone will not bring a halt to this situation. On the economic side, what can we do? You got it right, Baroness Ashton: implement the economic sanctions we have introduced, stop Syrian oil imports to the European Union and support the decisions of the Arab League and Turkey. On the political front, we should firstly support the deployment of ground forces requested by the Arab League. Secondly, we should strengthen relations with the Syrian National Council. I would also like to ask your opinion, Baroness Ashton, on the French initiative to create a humanitarian corridor protected by international troops. Lastly, we should obtain a more solid resolution from the United Nations, overcoming the reticence of some permanent members of the Security Council, such as China and Russia, whose position is absolutely unjustifiable, continuing in the vein of Resolutions 1970 and 1973, which, in the case of Libya, made it possible to put an end to a government’s criminal violence against its own people. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the next EU-US summit will be determined by the economic and financial crisis. I believe that both parties should adopt a modest approach and apply that Chinese proverb that, before launching ourselves into the task of putting the world to rights, we should first take a look at our own house. This means weighing up the global influence of each party and highlighting the role and the economic, commercial, financial and industrial weight of the European Union. Beyond the economic and financial problems, I believe that it is important to consider the lessons learned in Libya, after Operation Unified Protector, where the European Union was criticised. We should also consider the situation in Syria, after today’s meeting of the Arab League and try to move forward the search for a resolution in the Security Council of the United Nations. Then there is the peace process in the Middle East, which the Commissioner referred to, and the Palestinian question, in which the European Union gave a pitiful performance at the vote in UNESCO. We should also ask for greater consistency between words and deeds after the speech of President Obama in the United States. It is clear, Madam President, that the European Union and the United States are two partners who have a shared vision of the world, and although this is not always identical, they have a duty to understand and respect each other. Therefore it must be accepted that in today’s globalised world, in the face of challenges and threats that affect us all equally – whether it is the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime, the economic and financial crisis or unemployment, protecting the environment and natural resources or emigration – we must search for responses to all of these equally. It must also be accepted that unilateralism, even for the most prosperous and the most powerful, is an impossible dream. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, a balanced approach to the problem should be based on three premises: the State of Israel’s legitimate desire for security, the frustration of the Palestinian people and the blockage in the peace process. All of this, Baroness Ashton, comes at a time when international attention is focused on the Arab Spring, at a time when the United States is hampered by its electoral commitments, at a time when the government of Israel is divided and has almost no room for manoeuvre and when Palestinian radicals are increasingly showing their pleasure with the lack of results. Given this situation, Baroness Ashton, the question is very simple: what can we do as the European Union? In this context, I would like to tell you that Parliament, which has criticised you so many times – and I have been the first to do so – must acknowledge your efforts to seek solutions in Cairo, Ramallah, Jerusalem, New York and Washington, and your calls for the European Union to speak with one voice. In politics, Madam President, whatever is impossible is wrong. In the face of the United States’ announced veto in the Security Council, the President of France, as in the Georgia crisis in 2008 and this year in Libya, has proposed a compromise solution, which is the Vatican solution. Baroness Ashton, what view should we take of this initiative? Do you think it can be supported by the Member States? What can the European Union do to make the Quartet’s solution acceptable to the Palestinians? Madam President, if the European Union wants to be relevant and not decline in significance on the international stage, it must take a step forwards. It must move in the right direction and rouse itself from its lethargy. I am not saying this because of you, Baroness Ashton. You have done a lot and you have done it well, but you must propose solutions that are concrete, tangible, with defined costs and a precise timetable. You need to do this – and this is the hard part – without impinging on or harming the dignity of either side, while also recognising the inalienable rights that will enable one side to live in peace and security and the others to form their own state.

 Madam President, Commissioner, if we consider that a 42-year dictatorship has been brought to an end within a period of six months, in theory that could sound like a relatively short time frame. However, if we take this into account and consider it in the context of the human lives lost, the suffering caused and the setback this will bring for generations to come, then I think our assessment will be significantly different. In any event, everything remains to be done now that Muammar Gaddafi’s regime has fallen: provide humanitarian aid; guarantee security; establish order and control along the borders; bring about economic reconstruction, as well as a process of transition under extremely difficult circumstances; and ensure that there is no impunity for crimes committed. The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Dowgielewicz, has just said – and I agree with his assessment – that, within the framework of both NATO and the European Union, this despicable regime has been done away with thanks, in particular, to the action taken by specific Member States – such as France and the United Kingdom – and thanks to the determination and courage shown by the Libyan people. We should also acknowledge that the European Union, after some early wavering and remaining within the scope of its powers, acted swiftly and properly. It is true, as well, that Parliament was the first authority to call for the recognition of the National Transitional Council (NTC), thanks – if truth be told – to an invitation by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. It should also be noted that France was the first country to recognise the NTC. We have EUR 154 million in humanitarian aid, and a newly opened EU Office in Benghazi and Tripoli, which should quickly be upgraded to delegation status and for which a head of delegation with auctoritas
 should be appointed as soon as possible in order to tackle the important task of coordinating EU action with the Member States, and also with the Office that the Secretary General of the United Nations requested from the United Nations Security Council. Madam President, Mr Dowgielewicz, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, just three days ago in this Parliament we, like many others around the globe, commemorated the tenth anniversary of the vicious terrorist attack on the Twin Towers. The EU must make the Arab Spring one of its absolute priorities for two reasons: firstly, in order to live up to that cry for freedom and dignity that is spreading through North Africa and the Arab nations; and secondly, to prevent radical Islamic fundamentalism from taking root in the societies around us and interrupting the process of transition that is under way in those countries and, above all, to prevent freedom from being threatened once again by barbarity and fanaticism. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Secretary-General, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the interest we have been taking in the Arab Spring, as shown by the debate we have just had on Libya and Syria, should not distract our attention away from the situation in the Middle East and, in particular, from the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. This issue can be approached from an outside perspective – any implications that the outcome of the General Assembly might have on the peace process, and any change to the status quo, count a great deal – and from the perspective of the internal dimension of the EU. With regard to the external perspective, the peace process is in deadlock, as Mr Dowgielewicz has just told us. We are seeing increased tension in the region – the most tangible evidence of that was the attack on the Israeli embassy in Egypt – and also very particular circumstances for the United States government. President Obama is going to have difficulty meeting the proposals he set out in his inaugural speech in Cairo, because of the situation within the United States and also as a result of the electoral process he will soon have to face. Mr President, in politics anything that is not possible is false; without wishing to prejudge the substance of the resolution that is going to be adopted, I believe that we should start getting ready to adopt a draft resolution that improves the status of Palestine within the United Nations. This leads me on to the internal dimension of this issue: it is vital that the EU can express itself in a united voice on this sensitive point. Our past experiences in the United Nations have not been glorious. To be sure, we have shifted position in light of the new mechanisms established by the Treaty of Lisbon, and I believe that we need to focus all our efforts on three objectives: the peace process must move forward, and the status quo of a lack of negotiations must end; the chances to move forward on this issue must not be compromised or endangered; and the dignity of both parties in this conflict must be respected. Mr President, on this point I feel that the EU’s greatest strength is its union, and its greatest weakness is its division. I would therefore ask Mr Dowgielewicz – I realise, of course, that the Commissioner and Baroness Ashton are doing all they can on the matter – to ensure that the European Union faces this sensitive issue without showing its customary division, and appears united by making a positive, active contribution to the progress that needs to be made in this conflict.

Mr President, they say that when the celebrated thinker, Ortega y Gasset, was asked what distance one needed to be from events in order to write history, he said, far enough not to be able to see the profile of Cleopatra’s nose. Lady Ashton, I bring this anecdote up not because Egypt is a country affected by the Arab Spring but rather because in the EU, we are experiencing an historic dilemma involving a lack of confidence in our project, debt crisis, the calling into question of the basic achievements that are most valued by our citizens, such as the Schengen area, and doubts over the ability of NATO. However, over the last two and a half years, we have experienced tangible progress in the form of your own duties as Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the birth of the European External Action Service and the Joint Communication on a renewed European Neighbourhood Policy. You said yesterday that our neighbours will always be there and I share that view. The question is about us, whether we will rise to the occasion, whether we will live up to the expectations of our citizens, who regard foreign policy as a barometer for the state of the EU, whether we will be able to accompany these transition processes effectively in the countries that are the subject of the resolution that we will adopt tomorrow. Lady Ashton, we are clearly backing that. We believe and hope that you will succeed in your work, but in order to do so, you must act with the highest profile. Not a physical profile, like in Ortega’s response, but rather a political profile, with particular emphasis on finding the greatest common denominator and not the lowest common multiple. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the central factor in this overly broad debate should be the situation in North Africa and the Near East. We must approach this debate without extolling virtues – Baroness Ashton has rightly highlighted some positive elements; I would emphasise the good or, rather, the better provision of information between Parliament and the European External Action Service – yet also without concealing defects, and a voice as sensible as that of Giorgio Napolitano, our former fellow Member and President of the Italian Republic, has reminded us of this recently. Among the negative aspects, and despite the efforts of Baroness Ashton, is the different yardsticks against which the cases of Libya and Syria are measured in the United Nations Security Council and also in the Council of Ministers of the European Union. Also among the negative aspects, Baroness Ashton, is the situation of Camp Ashraf: you are aware of the positive, constructive and moderating role that my group is playing in the development of foreign policy, and believe me when I say that the importance and sensitivity of the Iranian dossier has not escaped me. However, in spite of the warnings about the humanitarian aspect made to your services, to your collaborators, to your cabinet and to your Director-General, and despite the fact that I submitted a draft statement to you myself, you did not speak out until there had been 32 deaths and more than 300 wounded. You can draw your own conclusions. You yourself said this morning that we have to act and we have to be coherent, particularly in relation to the defence of human rights; especially by taking risks, Baroness Ashton, when there are lives in danger. My question to you is this: with regard to the Cuban dissident, Juan Wilfredo Soto García, who was arrested, beaten and finally killed, are you willing to call for an investigation to shed light on these tragic events? If this investigation shows that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the beating received and his death, are you willing to condemn them? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I entirely agree with what you have just said. Mr Németh, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that we have been continuously following the flow of information provided by the High Representative, Mrs Ashton, on the developments in these countries and I think we should recognise the efforts she is making on behalf of the European Union in support of the democratic aspirations in Bahrain, Yemen and Syria. Tomorrow, Parliament will adopt a resolution supported by all the political groups in this regard. However I would like to put forward a couple of questions, Mr President, and would ask Mr Németh to pass them on to Mrs Ashton. First of all, in some bodies of the Union and, of course, in this Parliament, there is the feeling that we are taking a step back in the development of the Common Security and Defence Policy, and that we are being taken back to the times of political cooperation. Obviously, that is not why we established the Treaty of Lisbon. Secondly, a contradiction has arisen, related to the growing need for a European presence in those countries, with no knowledge of what will be the end result of these transitional processes. It is clear that we have to be present, and it is also clear that the slogan used in Mrs Ashton’s communication is very wise: ‘more for more’ However, the question I wish to ask – and I shall conclude now, Mr President – is whether the EU Member States are willing to increase resources to meet the growing needs that are emerging in those countries. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Madam President, the crisis in North Africa is putting the mechanisms established in the Treaty of Lisbon to the test. Yesterday, in the High Representative’s appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we stressed the positive aspects of European Union action: Baroness Ashton’s communication that distinguishes between the short, medium and long terms; rapid application of Resolution 1970 of the United Nations Security Council; the ability to negotiate with the Arab League; and the European Council meeting. However, it is only fair to say here today that there are still certain questions being asked by European public opinion and, therefore, by our citizens. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt is absolutely right. How is it possible that, in this day and age, the four Member States that form part of the United Nations Security Council do not vote in the same way but rather do so differently? How is it possible, in this day and age, that we should be discussing whether the United Nations resolution is applied by the European Union, by NATO or by the international coalition, when we are talking about the same resources coming from the same taxpayers; about the same ships and their use in the same theatre of operations? It is clear that we still have much to improve as regards our capacity for coordination, and much to improve too in the decision-making process. There is a famous line from a film, which says that ‘we will always have Paris’. Someone said during this debate that the European Union’s response has been hasty. If it had not been for France’s courage, determination and consistency – and that is how it must be put – in recognising the rebels, in sending the Minister of Foreign and European Affairs to the Security Council, in calling the Elysée summit and in applying the resolution, Lady Ashton, Colonel Gaddafi’s troops would already have entered Benghazi.

 Mr President, the European Union finds itself torn between two frustrations in the Libyan crisis, between what is desirable – the earliest possible disappearance of a criminal regime that is determined to die killing – and what is achievable. If we are honest, Mr President, we must acknowledge that the European Union, despite all its efforts, has not lived up to public expectations. This is not a criticism, Baroness Ashton, but rather a question of powers. We have acted promptly and we have acted well, within the scope of our powers, with the European Union fully endorsing Resolution 1970 of the United Nations Security Council. However, we are not a military union. We are aspiring to be a political union, and we are still only an embryonic player on the international stage. This is why, Mr President, whilst we are holding this debate, whilst the United Nations Human Rights Council is meeting today, and whilst the Council of Ministers for Defence, the Foreign Affairs Council and the European Council are meeting tomorrow, people are still dying in Libya. It is against this backdrop that we must think about what it is that we can do. Can we stand aside whilst innocent civilians are massacred? Can we remain impassive to the ‘Somalisation’ of Libya, whilst the United Nations Security Council reaches another slow motion decision? The European Union must send a message that is loud and clear, and has a single message: ‘the Gaddafi regime must end right now’. This message must be accompanied by a set of measures that ratchet up the pressure. First and foremost, Mr President, the no-fly zone, the neutralising of Mr Gaddafi’s communications – and I believe we should congratulate the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe for bringing representatives of the Libyan opposition to the European Parliament – and, of course, international coordination, most particularly with the African Union and also with the Arab League. This, Mr President, is what the public is expecting of us, and you will have the full support of our political group to achieve it, Baroness Ashton. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, in the context of our debate on the current human rights situation, and in view of the last report discussed, I would like to address the following question to Lady Ashton. In view of the current situation in some North African countries and within the region, do you feel that this is the right time to be opening a European Union delegation in Iran? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I did not really understand Lady Ashton’s answer. I am not sure whether she gave me an answer, whether she said that she would respond at a later date to my question on whether it is the right time to be opening a European Union delegation in Iran given the current human rights concerns, or indeed whether there was no answer. As I did not understand the answer, I would like to repeat my question. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, you quite rightly said, Baroness Ashton, that the situation in the southern Mediterranean is diverting attention from the conflict in the Middle East and the peace process, which has already been drawn out over almost 30 years and appears to have come to a standstill. As your visit has demonstrated, current events and the general situation in the region have had an impact on the process. In the light of that visit, I would like to ask your views on a number of issues. This morning, we discussed the difficulties that the United Nations Security Council is having in obtaining a further resolution to impose a no-fly zone in Libya. To what extent do you feel that the peace process and the credibility of a key player have been affected by its recent veto of the proposed resolution condemning the settlements in the Palestinian territories? In your opinion, how does the lack of a Security Council decision affect perceptions of the Obama administration’s commitment to pursuing this process? Secondly, how do you view the decision taken by the Palestinian National Authority to hold presidential and legislative elections before September and Hamas’s decision not to take part in these elections? Lastly, Baroness Ashton, I would like to hear what you think of the resignation of the Palestinian chief negotiator following the publication of documents by WikiLeaks, the reshuffle within the Palestinian National Authority and the repercussions that the leaked documents have had on the Palestine side, on the Israeli Government, or on both parties as a whole.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mubarak has disappeared from the scene and everyone seems to have breathed a sigh of relief. Firstly, the Egyptian people, who have seen their legitimate expectations of greater dignity and democracy satisfied, and, secondly, the international community that, not without a certain cynicism, has gone from being the ally of yesterday to the nuisance of today and, perhaps, to the accused of the future. However, Madam President, I do not believe that we should deceive ourselves. The departure of Mr Mubarak and Mr Ben Alí are necessary conditions, but not sufficient, to guarantee the process of democratic transition, over which there still hang many uncertainties. The most important thing is: to consolidate democracy. Madam President, it is also evident that, although democratic freedoms and human rights can be initiated by sixteen days of protest and public spiritedness, and be proclaimed by law from morning to night, economic and social progress cannot, unfortunately, be marshalled in the same manner. We have seen this in the heavy economic losses that both Egypt and Tunisia have been suffering in recent days. Returning to the Commissioner’s speech, I would like to say that, after the initial hesitations and some problems with the EU’s image, it appears that things are back on track. Baroness Ashton is in the region and what Mr Füle proposes makes a lot of sense. Firstly, to firmly and wholeheartedly support the process of democratic transition and the political reforms in those countries.Secondly, to carry out a critical review of the European neighbourhood policy in a way that strengthens the democratic clause. We have heard today, in the Enlarged Bureau, from the Polish Foreign Minister, the next President-in-Office of the Council, and his initiative to establish a Polish foundation on the subject of democracy and human rights. This could also be extended to the entire EU. Madam President, the EU has mobilised large amounts of resources in its Euro-Mediterranean policy with poor results. The EU’s image has suffered in this conflict, even more than that of other international players. However, the EU’s appeal remains intact. I would like to say, Madam President, that this is a good opportunity to underline that the EU understands, once and for all, that today history is being made in the present and in these historic times we are living through we have to act as a global player and perform the necessary duties or we will have to resign ourselves, Madam President, to not playing on the international stage in the role we want to maintain and we will have to restrict ourselves, as was the case until now, to picking up the bill for major global problems. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, whatever the result or outcome of the situation in Egypt, I believe that we are safe in saying that there will be a before and after the events that have taken place in Tunisia. It is my opinion that we should not be looking for culprits in this House as this crisis has caught the European Union on the wrong foot, however I feel that we ought to draw some conclusions on the matter. Firstly, the European Union needs to be more visible, it needs to speak with a unified voice and to avoid any cacophony; it is for this reason that we have created the European External Action Service and the figure of the High Representative. Secondly, we need to draw on the lessons offered to us by complacent policies with the enemies of freedom, from Belarus to Cuba and with the Mediterranean countries in between. We need to ask ourselves if there really is more stability, more prosperity and more democracy as the Barcelona Process intended. Thirdly, Mr President, I feel that we need to distinguish between what the European Union needs to do in the medium term and what it needs to do in the short term. In the short term – I think that Baroness Ashton has drawn up a road map – the European Union needs to offer resolute support to these transition processes so as not to frustrate these friendly countries’ hopes for freedom. It is also our duty, Mr President, to warn them of the risks involved in these processes, so they are not hijacked by the enemies of free societies. In the medium term, Mr President, it is important that the European Union reflects deeply on a strategic approach to reforming our neighbourhood policy as we also requested of Mr Füle yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. All of this must be done, Mr President, whilst bearing in mind that often it is more difficult to maintain the balance of freedom than to shake off the yoke of tyranny.

Mr President, as stated in the text of the oral question that we have tabled, in the last three years, we have seen an escalation of the situation detrimentally affecting European Union interests and citizens in the southern Sahara, which has become a haven for the Islamic branch of al-Qaeda, with a whole string of murders, kidnappings, extortion, blackmail, drug trafficking and people trafficking, the victims of which have been German, Italian, Spanish and, most recently, French citizens. We therefore want to express our solidarity with our French fellow Members, and say, Baroness Ashton, that this situation demands a firm, unflinching response from the European Union, as President Sarkozy has demanded. In this context, this response needs to be made in the political, economic and development spheres, and Mr Danjean reminded us of the huge resources in the European Development Fund. Baroness Ashton, I would like you to give your assessment of the G8 anti-terrorism summit in October – when you received the Council mandate – in Mali, which Algeria did not attend. You said that the response needs to be a regional one. I think it is a bad sign that two of the parties in this conflict – such as Morocco and Algeria – are not cooperating with each other, on top of the unstable situation in Tunisia. Finally, Baroness Ashton, I would like you to give your assessment of the anti-terrorist centre created by Algeria 2 000 km south of Algiers, in which Mali, Mauritania and Niger are participating, and to tell me if you share the interpretation that the aim of this anti-terrorist centre is to prevent the European Union and the United States from being present in order to guarantee security in the area.

Mr President, the recent events in Tunisia should encourage us to reflect with a sense of responsibility on at least two issues. Firstly, on whether policies to support the status quo 
in countries that lack democratic freedoms really contribute to stability, in this case, in our immediate vicinity. Secondly, Mr President, we should reflect on whether the disappearance of Mr Ben Ali from the political scene is sufficient to guarantee that a real democratic transition will be brought about. In my view, Mr President, the answer to both these questions is no. Therefore, Mr Füle, there needs to be a thorough reflection around why the Neighbourhood Policy, in the spirit of the Barcelona Process, has not had the intended democratising effects, and how we could or should make adjustments to it. Secondly, experience has shown us in many cases that, when there is a power vacuum, the most radicalised and extremist parties replace the process, hijack it and want to ruin it. Mr President, if it is simply to defend freedom, extremism is not a vice; if it is only to defend justice, moderation is not a virtue. This ethical imperative means that the European Union must mobilise all its efforts to help ensure that this process is not derailed. I welcome what Mr Füle said about providing electoral assistance to Tunisia, but I think that it is even more important to go a step further and support Tunisia through a European Union electoral observation mission. It is not only because of this ethical imperative that is etched in the genetic code of the European Union that we should do this, Mr President, but also in our own interests: because there is no point travelling first class if there is a passenger in economy with a bomb in his suitcase.

Madam President, the new strategic concept of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), which emerged in Lisbon, was established in order to seek to respond and adapt, firstly to a new context, in other words the disappearance of the system of blockades and the end of the Cold War. Secondly, it was established in order to adapt to the new configuration of threats, and particularly to globalisation and the fact that our armies do not have apparent enemies and our enemies do not have armies. Based on this new strategic concept, while taking into consideration Article 5 of the Treaty of Washington regarding mutual assistance, there are three aspects that I am interested in. Firstly, how to shape this strategic alliance with Europe: Baroness Ashton, I would like to ask you whether you think that Turkey should participate as much as possible in the actions and the development of the common foreign and security policy. Secondly, regarding the ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by the United States Congress, do you think that this new strategic concept will be affected if it is not ratified? Finally, what are your thoughts on the subject of the anti-missile shield? Do you think that this notion in any way compromises the goal of reducing nuclear arsenals? It seems that there are opposing views on this among the Member States. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Madam President, they say that the philosopher Aristotle was walking around his famous Peripatetic School with his students when one of them made a comment that upset his master. By way of apology, he said, ‘that was not my comment, it was made by your master Plato’. Then Aristotle stopped and pronounced a sentence that has been repeated numerous times on the European stage from the fourth century BC to the present day. He said, ‘Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is the truth’. Madam President, Morocco is a positive and active partner of the European Union, and it is also a strategic and fundamental ally in containing radical Islamic fundamentalism. However, as President Sarkozy said when he spoke here, Parliament is the democratic heartbeat of the European Union, and has an irrevocable and undeniable commitment to the cause of human rights. Therefore, if these rights are not acknowledged, it cannot stand aside and look the other way. It must speak out loud and clear about the principles that drive us. Madam President, the European Union has been, is and will be a loyal partner of Morocco, but that partnership is based on principles and values, and we have to proclaim those principles and values. I will conclude now, Madam President, by saying that truly, moderation in character or temperament is always a virtue, but moderation in the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially freedom of expression, is always a vice, always a weakness and always cowardly, and as representatives of the people of the European Union we cannot allow ourselves to act in that way.

Relations between the European Union and the United States are, as has already been said, based on principles, ideas, a shared history and a shared passion for freedom. These values could, however, end up being diluted in rhetoric and languishing if we do not move from words to actions. One of the most reliable pieces of work that has been done in this House on the state of transatlantic relations since the presidential elections is the report by my colleague, Mr Millán Mon. The report is included in the current joint motion for a resolution that we will vote on tomorrow, and contains a series of specific initiatives that are still perfectly valid for establishing a genuine partnership, on which we need to get to work, Commissioner. Here, there has been talk of the importance of economic and trade relations, and 15 EU Member States alone invest more in Texas than the 50 US States invest in Japan. We need to give new impetus to the summit mechanisms, create a Euro-American Assembly and, most importantly, create a coordination and consultation mechanism for global issues and the most crucial areas of the world – the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan – and relations with the emerging powers. Mr President, during President Obama’s recent tour of the Middle East, we heard him say that they saw their most important partnership as being that between the United States and India. This reminded me of one of the fundamental aspects of Mr Millán Mon’s report, in which he recalled President Obama saying in Berlin that Europe was the most important strategic ally of the United States. The upcoming EU-US summit will be a wonderful opportunity to clarify this point and to clearly define what the strategic partnership really is. We could start by asking the United States to support the European Union in its demands to have an institutional presence, for example, in the United Nations General Assembly, based on the new approaches introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon.

Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks for the work done by the general rapporteur on the budget. Although, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we have exercised moderation and we are aware that the appropriations under heading 4 are increasing substantially above the average, we consider them to be insufficient for guaranteeing a consistent, visible and effective foreign policy that is in line with the ambitions introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. We are also surprised that the Council is expressing surprise at some of the tactical cuts being proposed by Parliament, given the significance of the cuts, both in terms of compromise appropriations and in terms of payment appropriations, which the Council itself has introduced. I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets, represented here by its Chair, for putting the appropriations for the new positions in the European External Action Service in reserve. Naturally, Mr President, this does not mean that we should not have a positive and constructive attitude, but obviously, in the conciliation process, Parliament has to be firm, very firm, in demanding its priorities, with the objective and aim of having the capacity to produce a budget for 2011, just as the President-in-Office of the Council has just said.

 Madam President, today’s debate does indeed raise the question of how to build a strategic partnership with China based on its economic potential and on our value system, particularly with respect to human rights, which have to be of a universal nature. Garton Ash, a brilliant British analyst, said that relations with China pose four problems, all of which begin with the letter ‘t’: trade, Taiwan, Tibet – and here, I would like to remind the House of the suspension of the EU-China summit in 2008 – and lastly, Tiananmen, in reference to the human rights issue. What is obvious, as Mr Kasoulides has said, is that none of the challenges facing the world at present, such as globalisation, the digital economy, reform of the financial system, the security issue, the fight against nuclear proliferation – just look at the case of Iran – environmental and natural resource conservation or energy supply security, can be resolved without the cooperation of China. The United States has managed to establish a structured relationship with China, though not without its problems. President Bush presented the Dalai Lama with the Congressional Gold Medal; nonetheless, relations between both countries are still functional. Commissioner, bearing in mind the importance of China on the world scene, in the United Nations Security Council, in the G20 and in the BRIC countries, will we, as the European Union, be capable of building and consolidating this relationship? More importantly, Madam President, will we, from the European Union, be able to smooth out the path to freedom given that rather unique system that is Chinese state capitalism? I believe, Madam President, that this is the most important question, and I would ask you, Commissioner, to defend our value system at the forthcoming summit, while also displaying a certain pragmatism.

Mr President, we are all pleased about the freeing of political prisoners in Cuba. However, on the subject of congratulations, I have not heard any offered to the Catholic Church and, in particular, to Parliament for the role it played, which has been key in the determined defence of all of those fighting for their freedom and dignity in Cuba. With regard to the subject of Mercosur, there are several clarifications that need to be made. As Commissioner De Gucht has explained, the Commission put forward some negotiation directives for the purposes of concluding an association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which were adopted by the Council and by Parliament. Negotiations have been deadlocked for six years, and it is clear that they have been reopened within the framework of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, with the support also of Parliament. The objective, at this point in time, is to reach a balanced agreement that shows overall consideration for the interests of all sectors within the European Union. I do not understand why certain sectors or interest groups should come out of this negotiation at a disadvantage. It has not been like this for 10 years, and there is no reason why it should be like this in the future. It will depend on the firmness of our negotiators. In any case, if this situation were to come about, it is clear that the Commission would need to come up with compensatory measures for the sectors affected. This is what has been done with third countries, with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and with the most recent agreements with the Andean Community. The main reason that this has been done with these countries is the need to defend European Union producers, of bananas in this case.

On behalf of the Spanish delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we would like to state that the reasoning behind our vote on the resolution on the process relating to the European integration of Kosovo is that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it were an independent state in an entirely normal situation, without taking into account the fact that the status of this territory continues to be very controversial within the international community – an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice is also pending – and Kosovo has not been recognised by five Member States of the European Union, including Spain.

 Mr President, the consultation procedure concludes with today’s declaration by the High Representative and tomorrow’s vote. It is therefore now time to thank all those whose work has made the European External Action Service (EEAS) possible, especially the European Parliament’s rapporteurs, to implement it faithfully and to ensure that it is able to come into operation as soon as possible, without losing sight of the fact that it is not an end in itself, but an instrument for providing the European Union with a foreign policy that is coherent, visible and effective. I am convinced that the guarantees that Baroness Ashton gave in her declaration are satisfactory from the point of view of political responsibility, and are in line with the prerogatives that the treaty assigns to Parliament as part of the information, consultation and partnership process. You may be assured, Baroness Ashton, that this House will be a loyal partner in the development of foreign and common security policy, as we have shown in the meetings that we have held with the new heads of delegation from Washington and Afghanistan., However, Baroness Ashton, we have a right to expect that the new service will be more effective and better than the existing one. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to wish you luck in putting the EEAS into practice, and say to you that, as the evangelical instruction has it, ‘by your works shall you be known’.

Mr President, irrespective of the contradictory versions of events – humanitarian flotilla or provocation strategy – Parliament must condemn the use of violence and must condemn the loss of human life, as it is irreparable. There are causes behind these events, and they have had consequences. Apart from the most distressing consequence which, as I said, is the loss of human life, the consequences include the derailment of the peace process; the distancing between Israel, the European Union and the United States; the separation in relations with moderate Arab countries; and increased tension in the region, with the Iranian nuclear spectre hovering over the whole area. I also think, Mr President, that the breakdown in relations with Turkey is an important factor. Baroness Ashton said something that I entirely agree with. Restoring dignity and hope to the Palestinian people will benefit the cause of peace in the region, security in Israel and, above all, the cause of the moderates and the unity of the Palestinian cause. It is certain – and we should not lose sight of this – that the lifting of the embargo is just one step. It is an important step, but it is just one step along the road towards peace. We are aware of the elements: the recognition of a viable Palestinian state; security for Israel’s borders; the resolution of the problem of East Jerusalem; the problem of the settlements, which needs to be brought to an end; and – I am concluding, Mr President – other issues. There are two issues involved in resolving this matter. One is international support and the other is political will. I am not sure, High Representative, that there is currently a sufficient mobilisation of political will. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

In view of the fact that some of the expressions included in paragraph 34, introduced by the opinion of the Committee on Development, are so ambiguous that they could be interpreted as being somewhat complacent regarding something as repulsive as abortion, the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has asked the group for a separate vote on that paragraph, in order to make it crystal clear that it is opposed to any initiative aimed at infringing the inalienable rights of the most vulnerable.

Madam President, High Representative, I would like to say that the report, as adopted by the committee, on the one hand, acknowledges the efforts made by the Spanish Presidency of the European Union – which I do not see in this Chamber, which surprises me given that we are talking about a Latin American matter – and, on the other hand, welcomes the Commission communication entitled ‘The European Union and Latin America: Global Players in Partnership’. I think it is difficult to find two regions that have more in common in terms of values and interests than Europe and Latin America. The figures, Madam President, are very well known: together, they have more than a billion citizens, account for more than 25% of global gross domestic product and, along with the Caribbean countries, include almost one third of the countries that make up the United Nations. It is also well known, although the figures show a slight decline, that the European Union is the main donor of development aid, the main investor in the region and the second largest trading partner in Latin America, and the largest in Mercosur and Chile. However, more importantly than the figures, we consider Latin America to be more than a market for Europe, and we therefore share a whole series of principles and values, which are pluralist and representative democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression, the constitutional state, the rule of law, respect for due process and the rejection of all forms of dictatorship and authoritarian rule. This summit, Mrs Ashton, comes at a very remarkable time in the calendar for the European Union and Latin America. It is a remarkable time for the European Union, because having gone through the reform process, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are a little engrossed in overcoming and contemplating our own problems, with the economic and monetary crisis. We have seen that, for the first time, the International Monetary Fund is not having to rescue a Latin American country, but a European Member State that is part of the Monetary Union. When we look at the European Union’s growth rates for last year, we see that, on average, we had a negative growth of 5%, while Latin America had a negative growth of 1.8%. When we look at the forecasts for growth for next year, we see that the European Union is expected to have an average growth of 0.7%, and Latin America of 5%. This means that the next summit is not going to be a North-South summit, like the previous summits, but a summit between equals. In that respect, I think that we should look back, if only briefly, and feel satisfied at what has been achieved in the last few years. It is clear, however, that a great deal still remains to be done. In that respect, Mrs Ashton, between 2000 and 2010, the European Union concluded association agreements with Mexico and Chile, but the United States concluded agreements with the whole of Central America, with Colombia and Peru, and also with various Mercosur countries. We therefore need to make up for lost time quickly, and in some way seek strategic partnerships with Mexico and Chile, apply the future developments clause in these agreements, and conclude the agreements with Central America, where we need to introduce greater measures of generosity. At the same time, Parliament welcomes the initiatives that you have put forward to establish the Europe-Latin America Foundation and also the financial investment facility. This summit is not, however, just another summit, Mrs Ashton. At this one, a very clear issue is going to be at stake. If we continue to lose our share of trade with the region, which has declined from 25% to just over 15% because of countries such as China, we are going to become irrelevant. Therefore, in line with the Spanish Presidency, I ask you, as High Representative and a Vice-President of the Commission, to send out a clear and very definite message regarding the commitment of this new Europe that we are building towards our old friends in Latin America. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their speeches. I would like to say to you, Mrs Ashton, that the fundamental element that will ensure that these relations move forward in the coming years will be the mobilisation of political will. Political reasons were behind the ministerial dialogue in San José in 1985; political reasons were behind the institutionalisation of the dialogue with the Rio Group in 1990; and political reasons were behind going over and above this in the summits mechanism. I would like to respond to Mr Kožušník by saying that we are indeed a community of values, and I would like to point out that in the last part-session, we adopted an important resolution on Cuba in which we called for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners. I would like to take this opportunity to ask Mrs Ashton to intercede on behalf of a dissident, Marta Beatriz Roque, who is on conditional release and is ill. She has just obtained Spanish nationality in a case promoted by a former MEP, Fernando Fernández Martín, so that she can come to Spain to be treated. However, we need to move from words to actions, and this is shown in the association agreements. I think, Mrs Ashton, that you have negotiated the agreements with Colombia and Peru very well. I think that although the human rights situation in Colombia still gives cause for concern, it has improved substantially. The Colombian people are clamouring for peace, and this agreement is definitely deserved. I also sincerely believe that a majority in Parliament is in favour of this agreement. Mrs Ashton, we need to give the Central Americans some room to breathe in the negotiations. We represent 25% of their exports, and they represent 2% of ours. We need to be generous and, as you said, we need to re-launch the agreement with Mercosur. To conclude, Mr President, I think that on the one hand, the European Union is in decline, in economic terms, and on the other, it is strengthened by the presence of the High Representative. Therefore, we need her to make a significant effort to demonstrate our political will at the Madrid Summit and to continue keeping relations with Latin America high on the European Union’s agenda.

Madam President, when my group asked for this matter to be included on the agenda, it did not do so in order to highlight errors, which are sometimes irreparable, in policies that indulge the enemies of freedom. It also did not do so in order to gain political return from this condemnation. It did so in order that Parliament, which is the institution at the democratic heart of the European Union, could speak out to condemn the death of an innocent person, and, above all, to express its solidarity with those in Cuba who are fighting, living and dying, like Orlando Zapata, for their freedom and their dignity. As the European Commission said, the Council’s common position is still valid, and it is an honourable position because it asks for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners. It is also a consistent position, because it asks for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be respected, in order for Cuba to be rooted in our system of values and not in foreign systems such as those of China or Vietnam. Madam President, the words of a brave man, Oswaldo Paya, who won the Sakharov Prize in 2002, still resound in this House. He said that the first victory to be proclaimed was that there was no hate in his heart. He said to those who oppressed him, who were his brothers, that he did not hate them, but that they were not going to impose their will through fear. He said that Andrei Sakharov left a legacy of dignity and of working towards peoples living together peacefully, and that often the voices that count the most are the voices that are not heard. In this House, we have not been able to hear the voices of the ‘Ladies in White’, 
who were also awarded the Sakharov Prize by Parliament. Now we will unfortunately not be able to hear the voice of Orlando Zapata, but soon we will be able to hear the voices of many more Cubans. In the meantime, Madam President, with the legitimacy that Parliament has in representing 500 million citizens from the 27 Member States of the Union, it needs to loudly and clearly echo the unstoppable shout of freedom that we are hearing from the beloved island of Cuba.

Mr President, yesterday, during the debate on the motion for a resolution on which we are about to vote, we expressed our sorrow at the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a 42-year-old builder and Cuban political prisoner, who died after a hunger strike and many years of arbitrary, unjust, inhumane and cruel imprisonment. In this House yesterday, Commissioner Georgieva strongly and forcefully condemned this event. I am calling on you, Mr President, on behalf of Parliament, to send your condolences to Mr Zapata’s family, which is being harassed at his funeral. I would ask you to communicate to the Cuban authorities your strongest condemnation of this completely avoidable death, which the head of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, Elizardo Sánchez, described as a murder dressed up as justice. I hope, Mr President, that this death will lead to reflection among those who, out of good faith or naivety, want to change the Council’s common position, an honourable position that merely serves to link any improvement in relations with the island to human rights and fundamental freedoms, which, as we have seen, continue to be violated. (Applause) José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

Mr President, I think that this is an excellent opportunity to affirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights, which is what this motion for a joint resolution to be adopted tomorrow does. Parliament has expressed its opinion on several occasions, normally through the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World, and through various resolutions, as we did recently in the case of Iran. Some fellow Members have referred to the paradox – a word that they have used – of certain countries that have an extremely poor record on human rights being part of the body that is responsible for monitoring them, and I think that the case of Iran is one of the most obvious ones. This is not the only example, and I think that the United Nations will become ineffective if it is really resourced by these countries, and will lose all political legitimacy and moral authority to condemn these events. While I am talking about this, Mr President, this week, another of Parliament’s bodies has been considering the expulsion of a member of this House, the expulsion of Cuba. In addition, today we must mourn the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a 42-year old builder and political prisoner, who has died following a hunger strike and arbitrary, inhumane and cruel imprisonment. The Chair of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, Elizardo Sánchez, a person who is very close to the spirit of social democracy, has said that this death was entirely avoidable and that he considers it to be a murder dressed up as justice. Commissioner, I would like to ask you – as we already know the position of the President-in-Office – if you think, from an ethical and democratic point of view, in response to the deplorable events such as the death of Mr Zapata, and if the Commission thinks, that relations between the European Union and Cuba need to be raised to a higher level and given priority?

 Mr President, like my fellow Members, I also wish to congratulate Mr Füle on having taken office and I hope that the excellent impression he made in his Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing will be confirmed over the course of his mandate, particularly in the sensitive area of enlargement. I would like to say a few words about Turkey, firstly to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the excellent results obtained in the committee. Her report, which refers to 2008 and 2009, neither overstates nor underplays matters; it highlights the efforts Turkey is making to try to meet the Copenhagen conditions and criteria. In my view, however, these efforts need to be considered within Turkey’s current context and political situation: seven years of Mr Erdoğan’s moderate Islamic government, with elections expected in July 2011; a country that is seething from the Operation Sledgehammer cases; from the annulment of the Emasya Protocol, which handed major powers over to the military; and, in particular, from the ruling that has banned the activities of the Democratic Society Party in Turkey. This context, Commissioner, means that the Turkish case needs to be handled with great caution. Turkey has to meet the conditions and requirements of the Copenhagen criteria and, obviously, it has to comply with the Ankara Protocol. However, in this particular context and situation, it goes without saying, Commissioner, that if any wrong signal is sent out, it could have very serious consequences for the security of the European Union, especially when the governing party does not have the three-fifths majority it needs in parliament in order to modify the constitution; such a signal could seriously give rise to alarming turmoil in an already unstable country that is a strategic partner for the West, in the context of the Atlantic Alliance. We need to use the utmost caution in the negotiating process in order not to make any mistakes. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, before we vote on this draft resolution on Iran, I merely wish to inform the Chamber that there has been an attempt to storm the Italian Embassy in Tehran and that similar incidents have also taken place at the embassies of other Member States, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Mr President, in Paragraph 24, this draft resolution calls for a European Union delegation to be established in Iran; my group would not want the adoption of this paragraph, which has been used in other European Parliament resolutions, to be taken as a sign of complacency with regard to these events. I would therefore ask Mr Füle to tell Mrs Ashton that the circumstances I have just mentioned should be borne in mind during the application of this resolution's mandate. I believe Mr Gahler is going to request the addition of an oral amendment to the resolution text so that the diplomatic interests of Member States can be protected in Iran.

Madam President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, I would first of all like to point out that the European Parliament has expressed its opinion on the situation of the prisoners in Guantánamo on various occasions through various resolutions. In his inauguration speech, President Obama said that he was making a commitment to close the Guantánamo detention centre within a year. This deadline passed on 22 January and the fact that it has not been closed is proof that often in politics it is easier to make promises than to keep them. Also, as the representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council said, President Obama’s personal representative has visited the European Union, met with our President and with several Member States and asked for our cooperation, which has to be offered on the basis of a series of premises mentioned by the Commissioner. One of these is that this is a problem created by the previous government of the United States, and that the European Union has to cooperate, but on the basis of certain requirements, in particular, the security of our Member States. In this respect, I would like to recall the decision made by some Member States, including the one that currently holds the Presidency of the Council, my own country. I would like to ask the representative of the Spanish Presidency if he is thinking of taking any additional measures to try to harmonise the response of the Member States to the problems that have arisen in Yemen in particular, or whether he is intending to leave this decision to the individual and sovereign context of each Member State, as decided by the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs. One final question, Madam President: it is indeed true that 100 out of the 190 or so prisoners that remain have been sent to their countries of origin or to third countries, and that 40 are going to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts. There are, however, still 50 that are not going to be released because there is not sufficient proof to take them into custody but the risk that they actually pose has forced the United States Government to decide that they should not be released. I would like to ask the Commission and the Council what they think about the situation of these 50 people who are not going to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts.

 Mr President, I would firstly like to say that the intergovernmental treaty was the only possible solution in an emergency situation. However, this treaty means a redistribution of sovereignty, a new social compact, and requires greater involvement on the part of the Commission and Parliament in order to give it legitimacy. What was the aim of these agreements? Two things, as President Van Rompuy has said. Firstly, to convince the markets that we want to continue together, that this is not a pegged exchange rate system that can be reversed at any time, and secondly, to stabilise the markets. I agree that, over the medium term, fiscal union was absolutely essential, because this crisis has been caused in part by government excess. However, it is not just the excesses of governments that have caused the crisis. Ireland and Spain had sound public finances and yet they are also in difficulties, because they were not competitive enough, because there was too much private indebtedness. This is why I place enormous importance on correcting macro-economic imbalances, which has gone somewhat unnoticed, and enormous importance on the issue of growth, which has gone unnoticed too. The uncertainty is greater with regard to stabilising the markets. I agree that we have corrected the private participation mistake: it was an error and we have put it right now. We have made a little progress on rescue mechanisms, but I am not sure that the provision made will be sufficient and that we will have the financing resources to make them effective. There are questions about leveraging the temporary mechanism and doubts about the permanent mechanism. Mr Barroso, I ask you to continue with the basket of bonds that, in my opinion, would be a good way of financing this fund. It would overcome the fragmentation in the debt market and make sovereign debt a risk-free asset once again. The European Central Bank will only act if it believes the summit will bring security, and we will see in the coming days whether it does or not. However, if it does not, it will have to seek alternative options, because we cannot go into battle against the crisis with one arm tied behind our backs. If the Member States have to insure against possible losses, then let them do so, but let us find a way of stabilising the markets that, may I say, are not doing well at all right now. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

 Mr President, I think that, in order for this exercise to be useful, we should start by telling the truth. The truth is that we are not capable of resolving any of the problems that we have on the table: neither the problem of Greece, nor the problem of Italy. This incapacity to resolve these problems is affecting every economy in the European Union, it is rendering the efforts of Ireland and Portugal useless, and it is spreading contagion everywhere, including to Belgium and France. The truth is that the penalty for sovereign debt does not arise for economic reasons, because the foundations of our current account deficit are better than those of the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. Therefore, if it does not arise for economic reasons, it is because it arises only for political reasons. We have not succeeded in finding the right model, and we do not have the institutional structures to resolve the issue. Up to now, all the solutions that have been adopted – and many have been discussed – all those that have been accepted are based on a restrictive fiscal policy and a restrictive monetary policy; this simply has not worked. Now is probably the time to consider whether we should look at other models, for example the Anglo-Saxon model, which is based on a lighter fiscal policy and an ultra–accommodating monetary policy. Obviously we cannot import the model to the European Union exactly as it is. No state, except probably Germany, is in a position to boost public spending, lower taxes or borrow. The room for manoeuvre is very limited, and it will be necessary to submit to fiscal discipline. We can, however, do this at EU level, and that is what you are responsible for. What needs to be done? I think that in the first place the European Central Bank has to do much more that it is doing now. Since 2007, the Federal Reserve has increased its budget by 226%. The European Central Bank has increased its budget by 103%. The Bank of England has a volume of debt equal to 16% of the gross domestic product of the United Kingdom. That of the European Central Bank is only 2%. Secondly, a bailout fund will have to be put in place using Eurobonds – with joint responsibility until the Treaty is amended – but before 9 December. It will then be necessary to cater for growth using the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the project bonds, which are like the Loch Ness monster: we all talk about it but nobody has seen it. If that is not done, what Minister Tremonti said in Italy will happen: the Titanic will sink and it will take everyone with it, including the first class passengers. That is your responsibility.

 Mr President, the fact that there was fumata bianca
 this morning is good news, albeit good news which I would like to clarify. The restructuring of the Greek debt is also good news, but we would do well to admit that we were wrong, because, under the initial conditions, Greece would never have been able to pay. If we had acted sooner, the Greek people would have suffered less and the cost of the bailout would have been lower. Recapitalisation of the banks: I need to look at it in detail, but I do not really understand why they have changed the criteria for evaluating sovereign debt, but have made no alteration to the evaluation of toxic assets, and I do not understand why they have set a ‘one size fits all’ rule for the limit on capital, thus establishing similar recapitalisation limits for financial institutions which, in fact, are not similar. The Spanish Government will have to explain the transfers that it has carried out, but that will be done at home. On the other hand, the Commission does have to explain to us here why we are facing a banking crisis without it having submitted the proposal for a directive on crisis resolution mechanisms, as it promised to do when we spoke about financial supervision. A new storm, and still the lifeboats are not ready. Lastly, it is good news that they are boosting the firepower of the bailout fund. It is just a shame that we have to look externally because we are incapable of sorting out our own problems internally, and we will only do so if we have a comprehensive plan that simultaneously addresses macro-economic discipline, debt sustainability and, above all, growth. It is time that the Commission came up with a universal plan and for us to get moving. If we have to amend the Treaties, well, let us do it, but we need to do it in stages, starting now. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

 Mr President, we are clearly in a serious situation that calls for all of us to be responsible. All of us, including the Council. The difference that separates us today from the Council is the issue of reverse qualified majority voting. We all know that the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has not worked because the Member States have decided not to punish each other for any violation of budgetary discipline. Perhaps this is because they have read in the Gospel the quote that says, ‘Let he who is without sin cast the first stone’. What this Parliament wants – and this is what distinguishes it from the Council – is to put an end to this joyous camaraderie between governments, and replace a biased referee with an impartial one. The package is good and deserves to be voted through. When times are hardest, no one would ever consider saying that we have to spend more. What we are now doing is restoring budgetary discipline. However, when something is good it is not necessarily enough. The speeches we have heard today have shown several things. We all knew that the eurozone was not an optimum currency area. Everyone thought that the current institutional framework – a centralised monetary policy, a Stability and Growth Pact, and the coordination of the other economic policies – would enable the differences between Member States to be overcome, or at least reduced. That has not been the case. In the good times, their differences only increased; in the bad times, the pillars on which the monetary union was established were left in ruins. The ‘no-bailout’ principle, the ‘no-default’ principle, and now the ‘no-exit’ principle could also be out the window. We now find ourselves in Lenin’s ‘What is to be done?’ situation. The only solution is to move forward on the issue of political union. I welcome the issue of Eurobonds. It is a positive step in that direction, but more needs to be done. If establishing a political union requires reforming the Treaties by convening a convention, so be it. There is a Greek proverb that says, ‘rules are made for man, and not man for rules’. It is not a question of continuing trialogues until three o’clock in the morning or holding ministerial meetings at six o’clock in the morning. From now on let us think about what can be done to remedy this situation. The first step, however, is to vote in favour of this package, which is a good step in the right direction. Otherwise we will be making a futile effort and, as Mr Ortega y Gasset was just saying, futile effort leads to melancholy and – in politics – to opposition. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

Madam President, this issue raises a question, just one question: at European level what can we do to give work to those who do not  have it? To respond to that question I want to make clear the first agreed point. There can be no sustainable growth without a stable macroeconomy. Some of the quick solutions that have been proposed here, especially from the leftwing Members, would mean bread for today and hunger for tomorrow. The second agreed point is that Europe 2020 is a compendium of good intentions, it sounds good, but we have to move from contemplation to action. What are we going to do? How are we going to finance the proposed initiatives and actions? Is the ambition contained in the words of the 2020 Strategy compatible with the budgets cuts that have been announced? The third agreed point is that we need a complete picture if we are to set ourselves on the right path towards stable growth. To date this picture does not yet exist. What is currently happening in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council shows that among them there are a huge amount of scattered, incoherent and inconsistent ideas. There are three important actions to be taken. Firstly, stifling countries in difficulties cannot continue, and can be solved by a joint issuing of European bonds. Secondly, the bonds specified in the Monti Report have to be implemented, but they are not mentioned in the Europe 2020 Economic Strategy. Thirdly, we have to use the European Investment Bank’s resources, two thirds of which are the Commission’s, and which would only have to be increased fourfold in 10 years in order to equal the money that the Marshall Plan had for the reconstruction of the European economy. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
).

Mr President, anyone who reads the newspapers today will find out two things: that we are at a crucial point in the sovereign debt crisis, and that the European response is a succession of isolated provisions with no internal consistency. Even now, we have on the table the European Semester, the economic governance package, the provisional and permanent rescue strategy, the so-called ‘Eurobonds’ to cover part of the sovereign debt that is considered to be secure, plus an action plan based on the European Investment Bank and bonds for specific projects, which is in the proposal that the Commission sent us on the internal market. The first thing that the rapporteurs are trying to do is to combine all of this and create a complete design, a final picture to be shown to the public. Secondly, this design needs to be a European design that does not divide Europe in two – let us not stumble into a two-speed Europe – and that pursues two objectives with equal intensity: budgetary discipline – as much as is necessary – and economic growth to bring us out of the crisis that we are in. I have one comment regarding the rescue mechanism to which the President-in-Office of the Council was referring. In his first statement, he said that private investors would participate in the rescue plans, which caused shock and led to a protest by the President of the European Central Bank. It was explained, as Mr Van Rompuy did just now, that firstly, it would be case-by-case – who decides and based on what criteria? – and secondly, that it would be done according to the criteria and policies of the International Monetary Fund. The only case in which the International Monetary Fund has used this type of rescue plan was in Argentina in 2003; it plunged the country into chaos, from which it has still not emerged, and the private bondholders have still not been paid. Regarding Eurobonds, many issues have been set out here today. I would just like to add two more. It would create a market as liquid as that in the United States, and would give a boost to the euro as a reserve currency, enabling the central banks and sovereign funds to invest their reserves here. My final comment is that this needs to be complemented by the European Investment Bank and the specific bonds to respond to growth. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

Mr President, I am not going to emphasise what has already been said. The Belgian Presidency has been excellent. I would like to mention two highlights: financial supervision and the European Semester. Regarding these highlights, I would like to say what has been done and, most importantly, what needs to be done. In terms of financial supervision, in the space of 48 hours, the Minister, Mr Reynders, managed to get a dossier that was in deadlock moving, and we were able to give the Council and the Commission what the Commission had asked of us: European authorities that could begin operating on 1 January 2011: strong, authentically European authorities with clout. What happened next is not very reassuring. We still do not have presidents for the authorities; we have an extraordinarily small budget and I am told that the rewards for those who are going to hold positions in these authorities are not brilliant. They are, of course, much less brilliant than the bonuses received by bankers in London. There are two matters that still need to be dealt with: the regulation of the systemic bodies, and contributions and taxes on banking. In the regulation of systemic bodies, we want the European authority to be responsible for supervision, through the national authorities, which, in this case, would act as agents and would be subject to the instructions of the European authority. The alternative would not make sense. In terms of taxation, the most recent offering from Commissioner Šemeta sets out all the possible taxes for banks. Parliament has already adopted two contributions: the contribution to the coordinated guarantee funds and the contribution to the banking stability funds. This is a fact, and next we will be able to discuss the tax on banking or taxes on banking transactions, because, I stress, the rest is a fact. In terms of the European Semester, the only thing that we want is to coordinate with everything: with Eurobonds, with project bonds, with the mechanism, etc. … (The President cut off the speaker) José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

 – (ES) 
Madam President, what we need right now are clear rules, and what we are doing is precisely the opposite. I am therefore going to make a few proposals in order to re-establish clarity. In the European semester, Parliament wants to focus on a series of discussions, which are currently unfocused and do not fit with public opinion. We want the political responses to the recommendations made to the Member States over the next six months to be taken into account when establishing the penalties provided for in the legislative package on governance. My group would like to make it clear that there are no magic solutions in the legislative package for getting us out of the crisis. There are the well-known methods of budgetary discipline and structural reforms in order to maintain competitiveness. With regard to the crisis mechanism, as you said yesterday, Commissioner, President Barroso promised us here that it was going to be a European mechanism. Today the Council is proposing an intergovernmental mechanism. Is this European – in Mr Barroso’s terms – because it appears that the fund will be based in Europe rather than in the Cayman Islands, or does the Commission intend to help us to create a mechanism following EU procedure in which Parliament has a contribution to make? With regard to eurobonds, the Commission, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the experts say that it is a good idea, but that it is a premature idea, therefore we are late. What I propose to the Commission is that we begin a debate to shape a system of eurobonds that gives reasonable financing to the countries that do the right thing and punishes those that do not by forcing them to go to the markets at rates that are genuine deterrents. That is the only workable way of combining fiscal discipline and economic growth. Do not come back to me with discussions about whether it is too early or too late, because what we know now is that we have always been too late. Let us see if, for once, by changing the rules, we can be early. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

Madam President, Commissioner, the two block exemption regulations, one of which refers to specialisation agreements and the other to research and development, will expire on 31 December of this year. The Commission has drawn up two legislative proposals: two proposals for regulations that are before this House to replace the regulations that are now coming to an end. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since the initial regulations were adopted. There have been significant changes in legislation, especially the 2003 modernisation package, crucial legal judgments have been passed in this area and the Commission has learnt quite a lot from practice, which is also an important aspect. The Commission opened two rounds of consultations with those concerned, which is good practice in the spirit of legislating well and having public support. The big question now is as follows: what use is it going to make of the responses from those concerned during the consultation? Is it going to take notice of them or are these opinions simply going to be thrown in the bin? In this context, what Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs want to know is essentially six things. What are the suggestions and specific ideas that the stakeholders have put forward that the Commission is going to take into account when it comes to designing and defining these regulations and taking them from ‘the muses to the theatre’? Secondly, what does the Commission think about the horizontal agreements that are not covered by the exemption regulations on specialisation or research and development. What did the stakeholders say in this round of consultations? What would be the advantages from the point of view of industry, the real economy and protecting competition, of proposing new regulations to take into account horizontal agreements that are not covered by the two block exemption regulations that we are currently considering? Does the Commission intend to draw up new regulations to cover them? Yes or no? The question is relatively clear. The third problem that was debated at length in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is the subject of what is known as ‘patent ambush’, which, as the Commissioner is aware, takes place when one of the stakeholder companies that is participating in establishing standards withholds information on the patents that it holds or the patents that it is planning to register in future. This causes serious damage and inconvenience to those companies that are unaware of that information and commit to acting according to the parameters established. The question here is relatively specific as this is a case of distortion of competition and barriers in the internal market, which is the cardinal sin in our institution: does the Commission intend to tackle the problem of ‘patent ambush’ in the framework of the new draft regulations, or otherwise, does it consider that complementary sector-specific legislation would be necessary to avoid abuse of patent rights? Is the Commission committed to ensuring that there is an integrated, consistent legislative framework without internal contradictions between competition rules and sector-specific legislation in the area of intellectual property rights? The fourth and fifth questions relate to economic governance or, if you prefer, governance of competition. We have learnt that we need to try to converge with other competition authorities and, in this respect, it is important to know to what extent the Commission, in drawing up these regulations, has made use of court decisions and the decisions of national and international authorities. The last question refers to a subject that is a particularly sensitive one for my committee, and I am sure that Mr Schwab will have something to say about it. It refers to the marketing chain for food products. It seems obvious that there is inequality in conditions among producers, between farmers, on the one hand, and large chains, on the other. Does the Commission intend to do something to guarantee equal, fair treatment for the weaker party in this contract? These are the questions, Commissioner, that I would like to you to answer as fully, clearly and precisely as possible. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, today is a good day for Europe. In December, we had a poor agreement and now, thanks to the cooperation between Parliament, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, we have a good agreement. It is a good agreement that is going to establish genuinely European authorities that are strong and subject to the democratic control of Parliament: authorities that are going to be designed to ensure that all the banks are subject to the same rules across the European Union. They will be able to impose their decisions on the national supervisory bodies and, if they do not comply with them, on the private banks, in order to protect families and businesses. This will enable them to combat the banks that could cause systemic risks and prevent taxpayers from having to pay once again for the irrational exuberance of some financial institutions. The lesson that we can learn from this debate is that Parliament is not like a dog whose bark is worse than his bite that will back down at the slightest gesture from the Council: it holds firmly to its positions. Nor is it a dog in the manger: it is a good ally of the Council and the Commission for moving forward in the process of European integration. Thanks to my fellow Members, Commissioner Barnier and Mr Reynders, we now have an excellent agreement on which we should congratulate ourselves. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

 Madam President, on behalf of my group – and I believe on behalf of all the rapporteurs – I am going to request that, within the following reports that make up this package – the Giegold report, the Goulard report, my own report and the Skinner report – the amended Commission proposal be put to a roll-call vote. It is important to know that Parliament has the level of mandate that we have to negotiate with the Council. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

Madam President, I would like quite simply to thank the other rapporteurs, as we have worked together in an exemplary manner on what was a difficult package: we had before us a Council agreement that had been approved unanimously. Parliament now has a mandate that was also approved practically unanimously, with the enormous advantage that the winds are blowing in Parliament’s direction and not that of the Council’s text, which now seems extraordinarily archaic. Thank you to my group, thank you to all of the groups, and thank you to Parliament, which has won an important victory today. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

 Madam President, Cassandra had a gift: that of telling the future. She also bore a curse: that of not being listened to. For this reason, Troy fell. Parliament anticipated more than 10 years ago that liberalising the markets, without putting in place European supervision mechanisms at the same time, would lead to a crisis in the system, for one very simple reason: cross-border institutions cannot be supervised by national authorities whose jurisdiction ends at their borders. They can only be supervised by European authorities. We did not take heed of this, and the crisis erupted. Exotic products, unknown even to their creators, flooded the markets. Nobody trusted anybody else, nobody lent to anybody else, and credit dried up. The result: 23 million unemployed and EUR 3.5 billion – one third of our production – committed to aid the financial sector. Now what? We in Parliament have been at odds with the Council for some days now. Parliament has given a great deal of ground in order to reach an agreement; the Commission too. The Belgian Presidency has shown great willing. It has asked us for time. We are going to give it time, but let us show today that Parliament is united, that it has very clear ideas. For this reason, let us vote massively in favour tomorrow of the amendments that the most influential groups within this House have put forward jointly. There are several ideas that Parliament would like to highlight. The first is that the crisis will only be overcome when confidence recovers and transparency is re-established within markets, institutions and products. This will only be possible when there are European supervision authorities that are credible, strong, independent and subject to democratic control: authorities that are not limited to meekly repeating the slogans emanating from national governments. What does it mean to say that they are European? It means that they must have real power to ban the sale of toxic products; it means that they have real power to put an end to the regulatory distortions that prevent the market from working; it means that they must have real power to require national supervisors to always operate in defence of European interests. National supervisors cannot be feudal lords invested with absolute power. The European authority must ensure that the law is obeyed, that national authorities do what they need to do when there is a threat of pandemic, and that they are able to resolve conflicts when colleges of supervisors do not want to do so, or cannot. They need to be able to require private institutions that are offside to do what they need to do when national colleges of supervisors notice any omissions within the European guidelines. The second lesson is that, among cross-border institutions, there is a special, singular type: those known as systemic institutions. An elementary truth about capitalism is that when it is done well, money is made, and when it is done badly, money is lost. This governs everything except systemic institutions. When things are going well, they make a fortune, and when things are going badly, it is the taxpayer who has to run to their aid. To resolve the problem of systemic institutions, there are only two solutions, only two: either supervisors within the countries where they operate are given greater powers to control their solvency and liquidity, which would lead to the removal of the European Parliament from the equation, or truly European institutions are put in place, which is what this House is proposing. This means that European authorities need to watch over these institutions with particular zeal, as their ruin will be the ruin of all. It means that the European institution needs to be provided with resolution and control mechanisms for stabilising endangered institutions, if this is possible, or to wind them up, if this is not possible. Lifeboats should be made ready before the voyage, not in the middle of a storm. Also, these systemic institutions need to be required to pre-finance, to provide funds for guaranteeing the interests of depositors, which is our main concern, and for paying the costs of a crisis when it occurs. What cannot happen is for the taxpayer to have to carry the can again. What cannot happen, as the Americans say so often, is for ‘Main Street’ to have to pay for the excesses of ‘Wall Street’ again. I would ask the ladies and gentlemen of the Council who are absent today – they have been very active this morning, talking on the telephone, and it seems that the storm has passed and things are calm, and they are still not here – to convey the same message through the Commissioner. The Council has asked for time. Parliament has given it time. Let nobody be confused, however: this is not a sign of weakness. This is a sign of the strength of this House. The strength of a body that believes in what it says, and feels that it has the support of the public, who back it. The Council and the Commission, which is doing a magnificent job, needs to make use of this time to forge a parliamentary consensus on the European direction, in the direction of Europe. It must not make use of this time to try and put together blocking minorities in opposition to Parliament. I ask the Council to listen to Cassandra for once. Today, Cassandra is the rapporteurs who have spoken. Cassandra is also Commissioner Barnier. Those who are not Cassandra know only too well to whom I refer. Listen to Parliament, seek an agreement, say here what was said in Toronto. Do not say one thing here and another there. As old Castilians say, if the Council does this, God will reward it, and if not, God will demand it. God and this House. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, please inform the Council that there is a convergence of opinions in this House that is rarely seen. The Council must take note: for six months, it has been telling us that it had a fixed mandate from the Swedish Presidency, and now we also have a mandate. While we are talking about Cassandra, the important thing is not to prophesise the past, which is what the Spanish Presidency did, but to prophesise the future, which is what the Belgian Presidency seems to want to do. We have a consensus that is just as strong as the one within the Council, with an added advantage, which is that the winds favour Parliament’s stance and do not favour the old and anachronistic stance that the Council maintained up until the start of the Belgian Presidency. We have the advantage that we incorporated proposals that had been rejected; proposals that were in the de Larosière report, such as the resolution mechanisms to which Mrs Ferreira has referred. It makes no sense to put in place a supervisor that can forecast the weather but cannot do anything in the case of shipwreck. We have the advantage that we anticipated things that other institutions said later. When we talked about systemic institutions, we were told that there was no such species; the European Council acknowledged its existence in March. When we talked about how the taxpayer should not have to bear the cost of the crisis and that pre-financed funds should be established by the sector for facing up to its responsibilities, we were told that this was premature, utopian or simply idiotic. Then, the Europe 2020 strategy adopted by the Commission said it, Ecofin said it, the European Council said it and took it to Toronto, and I would not understand why they are not advocating it now.

Mr President, I would like to talk about financial supervision, which is the only real tangible manifestation of this ethereal idea that we call economic governance, and I must say that we are in a real ceremony of confusion. Just this morning, the rotating President of the Union declared that we are close to an agreement. He urged us to get moving, and both these statements are economical with the truth. We are not close to an agreement, and it is also not the job of the Presidency of the Council to tell the rest of us to get moving. What it needs to do is to get itself moving, and I will tell you in which direction it needs to go. The Council agreement is, as has been said here, an agreement of minimums; it is an agreement that is wanted by some European authorities whose only competences are to propose technical harmonisation rules for a standard interpretation of European law. There was no need to go to so much trouble. This could have been done by the Commission with Article 290, based on the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, which is in force. What Parliament has said is as follows: firstly, that pan-European banks must be supervised by a genuinely European authority that is strong and subject to control by Parliament; secondly, that the banks whose collapse could drag us all down should be subject to special vigilance; thirdly, that when one of these banks gets into difficulties, the banking authority should have a toolbox to prevent infection, restructure the bank and liquidate it in an orderly fashion without the debris landing on the taxpayers’ heads; and fourthly, that there should be two funds pre-financed by the sector itself, in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, so that we do not end up all paying once again for what Crispin charitably called the irrational exuberance of a few. Mr Barroso, the first time that I saw a high representative of the Spanish Government was on Monday. Before the start of the Spanish Presidency, they were given ...

Madam President, I am going to keep to my time limit and be very specific. I am going to tell the Council and the Commission exactly what they need to do in a week’s time if they want an agreement on the financial package. The major premise is that the future is looking brighter than it was a while ago, but there are still some clouds on the horizon. According to the International Monetary Fund, USD 800 billion are owed in losses not disclosed by the banks, and the international bank has lent USD 2.2 billion to southern economies that are at risk. The reform of the financial markets needs to happen now, because what is important is not that there might be a crisis – which there might be – but that we have put the measures in place to navigate it. The second premise is that there are significant disagreements between the Council and Parliament with regard to the European supervision package. Parliament wants the entities that could cause the system to collapse and endanger the real economy to be supervised more strictly by a genuinely European authority. That is economic governance. We also want mechanisms to be established now to remodel the entities that could cause the whole system to collapse. This is not about rescuing them, but about remodelling them and, if necessary, liquidating them without spreading the infection or rescuing them as a result, as it is always the same people who pay for this. Thirdly, the ‘polluter pays’ principle requires the sector to establish a fund to pay the costs of the crisis. The Council has a week to do what the Larosière report said and to reach an agreement in Parliament; if not, the rotating Presidency of the Council will be entirely responsible. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, we know a number of things. We know that this crisis has been like a mutating virus: it began as a property crisis, later becoming a banking crisis, then an economic crisis, and ended up as a sovereign debt crisis that could bring other crises in the sector in its wake. We also know that this crisis has been very expensive. According to your services, aid commitments to the financial sector total EUR 3.5 billion: in other words, one third of the EU’s gross domestic product. We also know that one of the root causes of the crisis was the lack of transparency in products, institutions and markets. That is why the report that we are discussing at the moment is so important. However, if you want a statistic, I would remind you that in the United States alone, in the years 2000-2006, asset-backed securities increased by a factor of four and mortgage-backed securities by a factor of seven; moreover, in a very recent court appearance, the advisors of a reputable bank said that they did not have a very good idea of what they were selling. We also know – and this is the third statement – that many of the commitments that we made at the G20 have not gone, to quote a Spanish poet, ‘from the Muses to the theatre’ – they have not gone from imagination to the written word. We also know that throughout this remodelling of the financial sector, there are three principles which I see as key: Pan-European entities must be supervised by pan-European authorities; we must have the necessary measures at our disposal to detect the virus and avoid infection; and, finally, we must prevent the public from having to pay by itself for those infections that it has not caused. Commissioner, you have a major job to do if we do not want the next crisis to catch us with our pants down. I will end by saying in French that I recommend ‘de l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace
’ in your mission – boldness, more boldness and forever boldness. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

 – (ES)
 Mr President, I am going to try to say two new things on the subjects with which the European Council has been dealing: the 2020 strategy and the regulation of the financial markets. As regards the 2020 strategy, all of us here have been saying for quite some time that one of the reasons for the relative failure of the Lisbon Strategy was that there were not enough tools to oblige Member States to honour their commitments. Now the Commission and the European Council are coming to us with a proposal that is more of the same: a weak agreement that makes reference to Articles 121 and 136 of the Treaty. The President-in-Office of the Council began the Spanish Presidency by saying that he was aware of this weakness and that he wanted more: that he wanted to strengthen economic governance. I ask you now, Mr President of the European Council: ‘Where are the courtly gallantries? The deeds of love and high emprise, In battle done?’ What has happened to these intentions? As regards financial regulation, I have one piece of bad news and two of good news. The bad news is that the Council has decided to delay the regulation of alternative investment funds – known as casino capitalism – at precisely the time when these funds have been partly responsible for the speculation on the Greek economy. The first piece of good news is that the 2020 strategy talks about obliging financial institutions to put money aside to pay for some of the plates they smash; or, as President Obama would put it, to avoid Main Street having to pay for the damage caused by Wall Street. The second is that for the first time the Council is singling out the systemic institutions to which it wishes to pay particular attention. These two things feature in the reports that Parliament is currently debating. They do not feature in the agreement that the Council reached in December. I would like to see the Council taking these two ideas up again, because then we will be much closer to playing ball. Believe me, Mr President, I am really keen to play ball with the Council that you are chairing. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are more aware than anyone of how my party wanted to help make the Spanish Presidency a success. We want to continue doing so, but for that you need to make some adjustments and you need to get on with leading the Union right away. Leading the Union means seeking a solution for Greece. Everyone has said so and I am not going to repeat it. Leading the Union means approving the Directive on alternative investment fund managers as soon as possible and not delaying it, which is what the Spanish Presidency has done. Leading the Union means approving the financial surveillance package as soon as possible, not upholding at all costs a Council agreement that is much more conservative than the Commission’s proposal and even more so than the de Larosière report from which it derives. Parliament will provide the Spanish Presidency with a supervision agreement that can be summarised in two words: more supervision and more Europe. I am sure that the Spanish Government, which has always preached these ideas, will support Parliament and not the other positions that originate from the other side of the Channel. Leading the Union means strengthening budgetary discipline, and strengthening budgetary discipline means coming up with new ideas to strengthen the preventive aspect. The Spanish Prime Minister knows that the review of the fourteen stability plans that have just been referred to was a purely bureaucratic procedure in the absence of a better idea. The preventive arm would have to take into account the competitiveness of the economies – because without wealth, there is no way of balancing the public accounts – and it would have to take the foreign account situation into consideration. Tougher sanctions would also have to be implemented so that the agreement really appears binding. Leading the Union means bringing in a new idea on the issue of governance, on which you have just written in a newspaper. The Spanish Prime Minister told us here how he wanted more governance when Articles 121 and 136 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which are the ones to which the Spanish Presidency now refers, are already in force. What else does it involve? Tell us what it involves and we will help you. In order to help you, however, we need to know what it is you expect and want, because in this House, vague, vacuous and empty ideas get very short shrift. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

Madam President, we are here for the first time in the history of the euro to talk about the financial situation of a handful of countries. I am emphasising the word ‘countries’, because the Spanish Presidency sounded like it was talking about outer space, and Commissioner Almunia only mentioned Greece. I would like to know whether the Commissioner continues to maintain in his closing speech that the problems of Spain and Portugal are similar to those of Greece and if so, what he would do about it. However, we are here to talk about these financial situations because the finances of a few could ruin the credibility of the currency of all and open the door to a two-speed Europe. The gap could increase when the exit strategy referred to by the Spanish Presidency is implemented, because we could find that the less developed countries have to deal with monetary difficulties and harsher monetary policies and, more importantly, have to use much more money to pay off debts and much less money to create employment. Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, without a sustainable economy, it will be impossible to balance finances. Without employment, tax revenue will continue to fall and unemployment benefit payouts will continue to rise. We are facing a crisis of confidence, and when there is a crisis of confidence, the first thing we have to do is tell the truth. We have to say how we have ended up here. What are the affected countries doing to get themselves out of debt? Are the stability pacts credible or not? Above all, we need to know what they are doing to straighten out their economies, because as I said before, without sustained growth, there will not be a sustainable economy or sustainable finances. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with many of the points that have been made, but must qualify some others. I agree that it is too soon to take away the patient’s crutches, but that it is time to get him ready to walk without them. We still have to absorb excess liquidity in the markets, correct the imbalance in public finances and re-establish respect for competition rules. In Pittsburgh we must do several things that we cannot do alone: we have to set up early warning mechanisms that work, because those that we had did not work; we have to revise the regulatory framework, because the existing framework has not worked. I agree that it is important to regulate bonuses and tax havens. These are all necessary, but inadequate, measures. In my opinion, it is more important to re-build the muscle of financial institutions, limit debt and set up reserves in good times so that we can weather the bad times. It is more important to make an effort in terms of supervision. The Commissioner knows that I supported the de Larosière report, although I felt it was inadequate, because I would support more centralised supervision. However, it is clear that European supervision cannot function without close coordination with the supervisory authorities of the other major economic areas of the world. We also need to do something about trade. It is all well and good helping the emerging countries, but it is more important to lift the barriers that are still preventing trade in goods. Commissioner, the most important point is that we need to establish the foundations for stable and sustained growth over a generation. For this we need free markets, markets open to innovation, markets open to entrepreneurs, but also markets subject to a certain level of regulation. I will end with a quotation, which will be familiar to my compatriot Mr Almunia: ‘Publish not many edicts; when you do enact pragmatics and decrees, see that they be good ones and, above all, that they are well observed’, so said Don Quixote to his friend Sancho. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again the defence of the general interest by the Commission and Parliament is clashing with entrenched national self-interest in the Council. Given the prior acceptance of the legitimacy of both positions, it is essential to find a balance. There is absolutely no doubt as to the relevance of the next multiannual financial framework. The Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and I, on its behalf, must reiterate that the Presidency’s proposal is, in our opinion, unacceptable. A cut of EUR 75 billion in relation to what was already an inevitably meagre proposal from the European Commission is futile and of no use to anyone. That is not the only problem: these new direct cuts in the agricultural and cohesion policies go beyond the ‘red line’ that Spain drew at the start of this work. Ladies and gentlemen, now is not the time to debate a supposed dichotomy between austerity and growth. Some of us are making clear efforts and sacrifices to correct our deficit. Spain, however, like so many other countries, needs to grow, increase its economic activity and create jobs. With this budget, none of this will be possible; it is pushing us past breaking point. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot achieve more Europe with far fewer resources, especially if what we have is distributed unfairly. If that is the case, Spain will oppose a multiannual financial framework for the European Union that means, plain and simple, the end to any opportunities for growth and, above all, any remnant of solidarity, and that is precisely the direction that the European Council is taking. Luckily, that is not the path that the Commission has chosen, and I must thank it for its efforts to adapt a different approach. In relation to this point – the need for the Union, the need for combined efforts – I want to thank Mr Barroso who, the other day in Cadiz, made a convincing declaration regarding the interpretation of the Treaties in the case of any potential secession within the Union.  He stated clearly and unequivocally, as guardian of the Treaties, that if part of a Member State secedes and becomes an independent state it will be dealt with as a third country and, therefore, it will be in no way affected by the statements and the effects of the Treaty. I hope, Mr President, that this can be recognised and that the Commission’s sure and steady approach can remain alive as a guarantee for us all. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Eppink that he has just used the little time he had to dish out words of insult and condemnation from a position of absolute ignorance.  Is he familiar with the Spanish Constitution? Because all Vice-President Vidal Quadras said – nothing more and nothing less – was that the provisions of the Spanish Constitution should be enforced; anything else was merely the personal comments of an individual, which had no bearing on anything and which I respect as such, but with which I do not agree. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is an old principle that has passed from the legal to the political world and it is ‘pacta sunt servanda
’, which means ‘agreements must be kept’.  By that, I am referring to the important measures adopted by the European Council in June to put an end to the crisis in which we find ourselves. Since these agreements were adopted, market pressure has eased, with markets welcoming decisions capable of breaking the vicious circle between banks and sovereign debt, as well as plans to move towards a genuine economic and monetary union and the commitment to defend the euro at all costs.  Ladies and gentlemen, the European Council held last week undeniably achieved some positive results: satisfactory progress was made towards a banking union, while the agreement between the 27 Member States on the creation of a single supervisory mechanism is also to be welcomed; and it is right that this task should be entrusted to the euro area finance ministers. However, I must criticise the biased interpretations that have, unilaterally, been made in this respect. It is not acceptable to make personal interpretations that could misrepresent the mandate granted to the finance ministers, nor do we approve of describing as settled matters that were not even discussed.  We urgently need to move towards a real single supervisory mechanism that covers all financial institutions. A joint deposit guarantee scheme and a crisis resolution mechanism must also be implemented. The euro’s survival depends on the rapid creation of an effective banking union. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, it has been said that, in order for things to get better, sometimes the chaos needs to get worse. The feeling of powerlessness was such that Europe was forced to react, and it did so for the good of everyone, because the big winner of this summit was the euro. This triumph has revived the hope that Europe is emerging from its paralysis, moving from thought towards action. Ladies and gentlemen, it was essential to adopt short-term measures at this summit, in order to guarantee financial stability, along with long-term measures, in order to solve the Union’s shortcomings. In this case, immediate action was essential in order to continue working towards what is important. The imperative result was to send a message that the euro is a joint, irrevocable and irreversible project. Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome such important decisions as giving the European Stability Mechanism the facility to recapitalise banks directly, which will break the vicious circle between banking debt and sovereign debt; incidentally, the current Spanish Government has always advocated this theory. It will also help in terms of intervening in markets to support the public debt of the countries that are fulfilling their public deficit and reform commitments. These decisions were necessary in order to guarantee financial stability, which must be the European Union’s highest priority in the short term. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the time for some countries to resort to nationalist maxims and throw up obstacles. As I have already said, it is the time to support Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, Spain is providing and implementing, in record time, the most ambitious reform agenda in the history of Spanish democracy, which includes major employment reforms. It is also carrying out a financial reform, based on complete transparency, all of which demonstrates its commitment to fiscal consolidation and hitting its deficit targets. We also welcome the decision to launch a process for greater economic integration, using four building blocks: banking union, fiscal union, a common economic policy framework and enhanced democratic legitimacy. Mr President, the history of first the Community and then of the European Union has always shown that, not only do we overcome crises, but also we emerge from them stronger. I am delighted that, once again, we have achieved this. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, the first thing I should say is that the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) approves of and supports the two packages that have been presented today, both the employment package and the solidarity aid for Greece, which is consistent with your overall proposal. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no denying that we are experiencing difficult times, and daily events remind us that the crisis is still far from over. Unavoidably, the focus has shifted back to Spain. Alarm bells have been ringing in the markets, without justification, partly fuelled by statements that I consider to be inappropriate, Mr President. Some of those have been made in the context of important elections, in which opponents on both sides are making my country a dialectical element of their confrontation. Naturally, we do not welcome any of these references. Furthermore, as a way of turning the attention away from their own problems, others are showing little political sensitivity in their dealings with us. Today in Parliament, some have failed to show any finezza
, as the Italians would say, and there has been a lack of political tact. Ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the markets does not reflect Spain’s strength. We are a solvent country and we are entirely capable of tackling our debts. The Spanish debt remains below the European average, and the Spanish Government is fully committed to fulfilling the deficit targets agreed with the EU. Mr Swoboda, Mr Rajoy has never said that he cannot meet the targets set by the European Union. On the contrary, he said that he is ready to meet each and every one of those targets, and he repeats that on a daily basis. The Spanish Government, in the few months it has been in office, has adopted, and will continue to adopt, very ambitious measures in order to guarantee fiscal consolidation and lay the foundations for greater competitiveness, job creation and growth. In the outlook it made public yesterday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) itself admitted that the forecast was made prior to any analysis of the decisions and measures currently being taken by the Spanish Government. We have adopted other measures: the general State budget for 2012, which we believe will guarantee that we will meet the deficit target this year; the organic law on budgetary stability; a reform of the education and health care systems, which will be presented this month and allow for an adjustment of EUR 10 billion; and the reform of the financial sector, which is going to help the financial institutions to bring in more than EUR 50 billion. In short, Spain is meeting the targets set by the Commission, and we are calling on everyone to be responsible. We all need to find a way out of this together, Spain with everyone else, without a doubt; the criticisms being made are not at all helpful. Either all the countries find a way to act together to bring about growth and a new direction, or else it will be difficult for us to move forwards under the conditions proposed by the Commission.

 Mr President, Mr Romeva, would you like Mr Rajoy to speak in Parliament? I think that is a good idea, and I would have no objections. Mr Rajoy, however, is not the protagonist of this crisis. The protagonist of the crisis is the legacy left behind by the socialist, communist and green left-wing parties in Spain, who handed over the worst legacy in political history, and this was after they had been handed the best legacy ever left by any previous government.

Madam President, Commissioner Kallas, I would like to begin by saying that if this issue has seemed easy, if it is reaching a successful conclusion, it is due in great part to the dedicated, rigorous and flexible position of the rapporteur, Mr Fleckenstein. I would like to thank him, on behalf of my group, for being flexible enough to accept our points of view and getting us to the point where we almost have a consensus. Ladies and gentlemen, the history of the European Maritime Safety Agency is a success story. Day after day, it justifies its existence and the reason for its existence. The amendment to the regulation establishing EMSA does not seek to rectify errors; on the contrary, it aims to extend the agency’s competences in the light of new challenges and the emergence of new problems, and we believe that EMSA is the appropriate instrument for tackling and resolving those problems. Parliament wants to make sure that EMSA does not turn into a body with a life of its own, but continues to be guided by the Commission and continues to intervene at the request of the Commission itself or the Member States. The serious accident in the Gulf of Mexico has shown us that EMSA should be entrusted with helping the states to investigate accidents involving maritime, coastal or offshore installations. On a separate note, it is important to emphasise EMSA’s role in supporting the monitoring of the organisations recognised as classification societies, particularly as regards ensuring mutual recognition. It should be noted that the agency plays a key role in Port State Control and the fight against piracy. For the first time, the report makes explicit reference to the agency’s work involving the satellite-based monitoring of fishing vessels and ships fishing in dangerous waters, for example, through its close collaboration with Operation Atalanta. It is vital to comply with the environmental strategy and support EMSA assistance when necessary. As regards the composition of the Administrative Board, I believe that there should be a gender balance and that this should be stated in a recital. I think that it would be excessive to introduce it in an article. I also believe that it would be feasible to promote maritime training and exchanges of good practices among institutions and schools. We will not support the European network of training academies as each Member State has its own special characteristics and needs. Finally, Madam President, regretfully we have to vote against Amendments 18 and 41 because the aim is to exclude the word ‘national’. That is something that is neither ingenuous nor innocent. No one and no state, especially in these times when we are giving up sovereignty in return for economic efficiency, is prepared to accept that the word ‘national’, the existence of the states, should not be compatible, as indeed it should, with the existence of the Union of 27, soon to be 28. Luis de Grandes Pascual,

Madam President, Commissioner, as you know, in 2008, Parliament roundly rejected the motion for a resolution that was presented to it. Later, in the same terms, the report that I myself presented to the Chamber was approved by a comfortable majority, with a great consensus and with the effort of the Commission and the political groups. What were the reasons behind Parliament’s change of mind? Undoubtedly, seeing that all the requirements involved in accepting the use of these scanners were fulfilled, including the preservation of fundamental rights and, among these, in particular, the passenger’s dignity and privacy, non-discrimination, protection of personal data and protection of health. In this way, we established what type of scanners were suitable for guaranteeing passengers’ security, on the one hand, and preserving their rights in full, on the other. The scanners will not use ionising radiation, they will not be mandatory for Member States, nor for citizens, and they will all protect the rights described above. True, the Commission has captured all of these concerns in its proposed legislation but, in addition to scanners that use stick figures, it includes the possibility of another type which, whilst guaranteeing the same catalogue of rights, permits the inspection of an image of the passenger, albeit blurred. We accept the reasons why it has proven necessary to include this alternative as an authorised method of control. Parliament also defends the need to guarantee fair competition and thus avoid any monopolistic temptation. However, today we call on the Commission to retain all the precepts that we defended in my report, all the guarantees of preservation of fundamental rights. Moreover, we encourage it to work with industry and the Member States in order to ensure that in the near future, only automatic protection scanners are used and that no inspector is needed to view any image.

 I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Fidanza, for an excellent report and for his good work in bringing on board the many ideas that have been put forward in this House to make European tourism a key asset of our economy. Tourism constitutes one of the Union’s largest sources of revenue, and in my country, Spain, it is essential to have a sound tourism policy that continues to attract tourists from across the world and helps to foster economic growth at a time of crisis. The European Parliament has, for the first time, expressed itself politically on this subject, and it has done so by supporting the work of the Commission, but also by setting forth new ideas that enrich future tourism policy following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon. It is not a question of harmonising, as this is precluded by Article 195 of the Treaty, but of supplementing national policies to improve service quality, to couple the ‘Europe brand’ with national brands, and to create budget lines that reinforce national policies. With a view to countering seasonality in the sector, I have helped boost the role of social tourism, paying particular attention to tourism for the elderly on the basis of the Spanish experience. I considered it fundamental to support small and medium-sized enterprises and to develop entrepreneurship in the industry, as a driving force for employment. The goal is to consolidate Europe’s image and visibility as a collection of sustainable, quality destinations, and to foster the competitiveness of the European tourist industry. In a global world where new markets are emerging, Parliament has an undeniable opportunity to maintain Europe’s status as the primary tourist destination in the world and to contribute to economic growth by bringing different cultures closer together. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 Mr President, we are all part of a whole, and nobody can survive alone. This emergency requires a joint effort and sacrifice. It is now being demanded that the Union show leadership, and that the mechanisms for governing and decision-making function in real time. The monetary union cannot survive without unambiguous political leadership. It needs economic governance, a common budget, a certain level of fiscal harmonisation and an emergency plan. Therefore, we first need to regulate public accounts, correct macroeconomic imbalances and stimulate competitiveness. No country should spend more than its economic growth allows. On the other hand, the intergovernmental nature of the financial stability mechanism is regrettable. The European Union needs a permanent crisis resolution mechanism under the Community method: a European Monetary Fund. If Europe wants to see leadership, ladies and gentlemen, then those decisions must be driven by Parliament and the Commission, rather than by the Council, which is hindered and slowed down by the national governments. It is the responsibility of Member States to do their homework in order to help with the decisions of the Union as a whole, and to do all they can to succeed in this vital task: achieve economic growth and create employment. More than one year ago in Spain, the leader of the Popular Party, Mr Rajoy, expressed his support in the Spanish Parliament for a specific amendment to our constitution. Moreover just last week, the Spanish Parliament and Senate reached an agreement on the matter, after Prime Minister Zapatero gave his formal support. The commitment to cleaning up public accounts cannot be an interim measure, ladies and gentlemen; it has to be permanent. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 This report on audit policy, as its title states, aims to analyse lessons from the crisis. Given that one of the causes of that crisis was a loss of trust, which is the most important value for developed economies, with this resolution the European Parliament is proposing to strengthen that trust by means of auditing companies. This report is the result of a convergence of opinions; these may have been divided at the outset, but they have succeeded in establishing clear rules to strengthen the role of auditors. Nevertheless, instead of changing the market structure by penalising some of the major companies, the decision was taken to guarantee free competition and give greater support to small and medium-sized enterprises so that they can establish themselves in the market. On that point, may I congratulate Mr Masip Hidalgo for the work he has carried out in the Committee on Legal Affairs. This is an ambitious report that is going to require considerable development in order to accommodate everything that has been suggested. There were many lessons to be learned from the crisis, and this is a clear example of Europe’s will to draw the necessary impetus from the crisis in order to implement the mechanisms able to restore faith in the global economy. Audit policy is one of those. Luis de Grandes Pascual,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is an honour to defend this own-initiative report. While it was initially intended that it would be limited to security scanners, the recent increase in terrorist activity demanded that the report go further. As a result, the Committee on Transport and Tourism unanimously agreed to make me the rapporteur so as to ensure that the report would take an integral view of civil aviation security. In keeping with that mandate, the report assesses security scanners, the decisions adopted regarding liquids, aerosols and gels, and security measures on cargo and mail. Transport security, ladies and gentlemen, is one of the main concerns in the fight against terrorism. Currently, Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 describes the different aspects which are included in the points of this report. In the area of security scanners: as is set out in the explanatory statement, this report derives from the Commission’s 2008 draft regulation. This proposal, if you recall, was rejected by Parliament for not demonstrating that it fulfilled a series of requirements such as respect for fundamental rights, safeguarding health and protecting passenger data. Therefore, the Commission has resolved, and I hope it will continue to do so, all the doubts that Parliament raised and which I have identified and dealt with in this report. With regard to the protection of fundamental rights, the new-generation security scanners comply with all the necessary requirements: human dignity, respect for privacy, non-discrimination and the guarantee of a high level of protection of human health in the definition and exercise of all European Union policies and actions, all of which are included in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. The systems in place are not usually those presented in the news or newspapers by critics of security scanners. The proposed systems do not show the human body, but rather a stick figure, a mannequin, a photograph of the fully-clothed passenger or simply an ‘OK’ in green when the passenger passes through without activating the alarm. In the area of data protection: data protection is an issue that is also under constant review, and is guaranteed by new scanner technology. This makes it possible for data to be automatically destroyed once the purpose for which it is collected has been achieved. With regard to body images, ladies and gentlemen: no body images will be produced. This is one of the basic points on which the vast majority agreed, without doubt because it affects privacy as a fundamental right that cannot be eroded. In the area of public health protection: the maximum guarantee has been given by Parliament. Ionising radiation, because of its harmful effects, whether through cumulative or long-term effects, has been made obsolete by another type of technology that does not affect passenger health. Therefore, Parliament is sending a clear message and saying ‘no’ to the use of X-rays. To summarise, ladies and gentlemen, security scanners are not perfect but they are, without doubt, more effective than simple metal detectors. They bring added value and can detect dangerous objects and items that conventional scanners cannot detect. They are a tool providing measures that are proportional to the risk they are trying to prevent. They will be optional and not compulsory for Member States, but those States that do introduce them should implement harmonised, minimum standards for everyone. They will not be compulsory for travellers, but those who refuse to use them will be obliged to submit to alternative procedures which are at least as effective as the security scanners. With regard to liquids: I am not going to refer to them as there will be a debate with the Commissioner, and two objectives have already been set: there is the unfulfilled objective of 29 April 2011, on which we are awaiting reports, and the guarantee that this will be met in 2013. The European Civil Aviation Conference guarantees that technology exists which is capable of detecting liquid explosives. Therefore, this report reaffirms that Parliament’s mandate must be implemented if everything is ready. It is clear that the first objective has not been met and, therefore, as I have already said and I repeat, we are awaiting the Commissioner’s comments. In the area of cargo and mail: the recent attacks carried out on passenger planes have led the European Union to develop a more ambitious plan and to act quickly to identify additional necessary measures. I support the idea that security and screening systems have to be proportional and equivalent. Goods transported on planes must be screened, particularly if 70% of cargo is transported on passenger planes. In this regard, I welcome the support of all the groups for raising the level of cargo security, as I proposed. To conclude, Mr President, all of the issues which are included in this report on aviation security are a response to previous terrorist acts, which is why, over the coming years, the European Union will endeavour to establish a security system that prevents and avoids future attacks. I particularly wish to thank all those who worked together to enable a very difficult and complex issue, which was initially rejected by Parliament, to reach this plenary session today – thanks to the Commission’s new attitude and the flexibility shown by the political groups – with widespread support and broad consensus. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his cooperation and dialogue. The Commission called on Parliament, and the Commission will take up the relay. The next steps are the Commission’s responsibility. We await the Commissioner’s comments. Luis de Grandes Pascual,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, this time I will try to be brief and comply with your instructions. Commissioner, thank you very much for your attitude and for being receptive to Parliament’s report. We may presume from what you have said that you value and take on board many of our assessments. I say ‘our’ because this report is not only mine; rather it brings together a broad consensus, and that is positive. I would add that I am going to try to maintain that consensus up to the very last minute. Mrs Lichtenberger, we are going to accept your second amendment, because I believe it is beneficial to the area of training. With regard to your first amendment, I will try to ensure you do not have the same reservations over the issue of the name given to the scanners, because nobody gets them confused. I know that you mean well, but I would be grateful if you could withdraw the amendment. If not, then you are within your rights and I shall respect that, of course. With regard to the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I believe it will be necessary to look at them in greater detail; I very much regret that I do not agree with the principles of your amendments. These amendments are not fundamental, and I sincerely believe that there is an underlying intention to vote against them, which I regret. In any case, I would say earnestly to Mr Hénin, and I am sorry he is not here, that in a democratic society there are no grounds that legitimise any terrorist action. No political cause nor apolitical cause: terrorism must be flatly rejected in a democratic society. With regard to the amendments tabled by the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, and I am sorry that Mrs Foster is not here, for she is always very kind, I believe these are unnecessary because what they are seeking to achieve in the area of profiling could cause confusion. In paragraph 4, which we are also going to improve with an amendment put forward by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament so as to elaborate on the strengthening of data protection, it is not necessary to talk about profiling as that could cause confusion and give an impression of discrimination, and I am sure that no attempt will be made to do so. We are going to accept, not just accept for consideration, the S&amp;D Group’s oral amendment, because I believe it is good and, if Parliament accepts it, we will vote in favour of it. As far as the rest is concerned, I believe that we are going to truly fulfil the mandate given to us. Commissioner, I believe we have done well so far; we have passed the baton on to you and I hope you will rise to the occasion. I am sure you will, as you have shown talent and courage, and I am grateful that you are sorry about what happened on 29 April 2011. I know you are being sincere, and I hope that in 2013 we will fulfil all the objectives in the area of liquids, as we are all trying to do. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 Mr President, it is no coincidence that Spain, Italy, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and other countries are all reluctant to accept the so-called Eurovignette. This common critical stance stems from our position as peripheral countries since, at the end of the day, it will be us who will pay this quite singular levy and the Member States enjoying a geographical location in the centre of the European Union who will collect it. The reasoning that underlies the Eurovignette is beset by major contradictions and the discourse that supports it becomes weaker every day. Even accepting the rationality of internalising external costs as a valid starting point, it is ultimately untenable to penalise heavy goods vehicles only and not ordinary cars with the aim of mitigating traffic congestion, just as the old ‘polluter pays’ principle is applied in a clearly discriminatory way. In addition to this, ladies and gentlemen, only 15% of the funds collected through the Eurovignette – which was conceived as a funding source for infrastructures – will finally be used to fund trans-European networks, and not as a requirement but merely as a recommendation. Thus, finance ministries will allocate the funds as they see fit according to the interests of their countries, within the wide sphere of infrastructures. The ultimate result will be yet another setback for road freight transport, which, the way things stand today, is the only means enabling the operation of the Internal Market. This is reality, ladies and gentlemen, a reality that is a lot starker in the context of an economic crisis. If European products are to be competitive in global markets, we cannot afford experiments that may result in even further damage to an already weak European economy by imposing yet more additional costs. Lastly, the food crisis, which has recklessly been blamed on Spanish products, has led to unfair penalties and huge losses for those penalised by the Eurovignette: freight carriers and prime crop farmers. It is for all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, that the Spanish delegation of the European People’s Party shall vote against this draft directive. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Madam President, recently, the Church of Our Lady of Salvation in Baghdad was attacked and 58 people were killed, mainly women and children, purely because they were Christians. Al-Qaeda has proudly claimed responsibility for this deed. This is not an isolated incident, but rather the culmination of persecutions of and attacks on Christians in majority Muslim countries. There have been expulsions from Morocco, threats in Turkey and attacks in India and Nigeria. In January, six Christians were massacred at the door of a church in Cairo. For how long will Western democracies collude with this by remaining silent? Fortunately, President Buzek has made a statement on behalf of Parliament. The statement by the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, condemning the attack, limited itself to condemning a terrorist act. Why is the motive not mentioned, in other words, the fact that they were Christians, which was the unequivocal reason behind the attack? I have not heard anything from Mr Zapatero, nor have I heard anything from Prime Minister Erdogan. What is the point of the Alliance of Civilisations? I am ashamed of our simple-mindedness and cowardice. I cannot help recalling the late, misunderstood Oriana Fallaci, who announced the arrival of Eurabia
 and was practically stoned for having the courage to condemn what was happening in this neurotic Europe. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, must be congratulated. We have had dissimilar, even conflictive positions, but she has found compromise solutions that allow us to stand together today on this important issue. Ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided that all the seas should be protected in a similar way, arguing that any other solution would bring about a situation of unfair competition. We accept the position of the majority in favour of a legal situation with uniform rules for the entire Union, although I will not spare Members the fact that such a solution also clearly implies a certain degree of unfairness. It is obvious that the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel are more polluted and, in my view, sulphur monitoring will have to be stricter. The measures to reduce transport time and handling costs in ports are certainly positive initiatives. Nonetheless, I will repeat this again and again: we still have work to do on this matter. Unless we liberalise our ports resolutely, they will not be able to expand the key role they will be required to play in the context of co-modality. The promotion of a CO2
 reduction strategy aimed at altering the specific consequences of climate change is also to be welcomed. I think this is a good report that must be adopted. But we must not forget that this report is in the context of a serious disaster, namely that affecting the Gulf of Mexico. In this respect, the Commission is urged to judge whether it is necessary, within the framework of revision of the Regulation of the European Maritime Safety Agency, to strengthen the role of the Agency in carrying out preventive inspections and post-hydrocarbon-spill clean-up tasks. Commissioner, this, I believe, is a necessary reform and the necessary mandate must be used to support these tasks. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mrs De Veyrac on her report, which has enabled an agreement to be reached at first reading. I must, however, make three critical observations that imply the need to make concessions whenever there are negotiations of this type. Firstly, the individual identification of victims has been dropped: when DNA allows such identification to take place, it is natural for families to demand that they be given not just any bodies but the bodies of the victims to whom they are related. Secondly, the term ‘causes’ has not been replaced by ‘concurrent factors’. This is going to be a source of litigation, and I believe it is a serious error – and if not, time will tell – as the technical investigation needs to be separated from the legal investigation. Finally, we find it deeply regrettable that the Spanish delegation may ultimately have to abstain, regardless of its favourable opinion on the subject. This is, quite simply, because the relationship with Gibraltar Airport, which is now governed by the Ministerial Statement agreed in Cordoba in 2006, has been mentioned since 1987. Previously, the legislation was suspended and reference was made to the differences between the United Kingdom and Spain, and now three references are made to those legal differences, and nothing more. This, of course, means that we will have to abstain, regardless– I repeat – of our favourable opinion of the report and of the work done by Mrs De Veyrac. Once again, I would like to praise her for a good report that will be fundamentally positive. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, I would have liked to have made a different speech today, believe me. You set out six months full of ambition, and set the bar so high with your claims that, when these are compared with what was actually achieved, disappointment was inevitable. What is certain is that you have not been able to overcome a complex situation for which you lacked leadership and credibility. You yourself pointed out once that the European Union is a club with rules and I agree. However, it was up to you to demand obedience to these rules. The reality is that it was the government of Spain that urgently needed to fulfil its obligations. Within this context, positive achievements, whilst not lacking, have been undistinguished. Unlike me, you have had time to talk about them. Democracy is a public opinion-based system. This is how it seems: President Obama’s disdain, as well as the cancellation of the Mediterranean Summit and the one announced between the European Union and the United States, constitute very significant failures. The rush to reach improvised agreements at any cost has not helped the image of Spanish management: as a way of achieving a respectable objective, it could be described as amateurish. Spain is a great nation, and will continue to be one, despite the poor management of this period. Our diplomats and officials have kept a stiff upper lip and, thanks to this, Spain’s prestige will survive. The truth is that the situation in Spain will count for more within the value judgment that will be made of this Presidency than what was done or not done here. Someone who has taken his country into a phase of uncertainty and unrest would have difficulty in providing leadership for an enterprise this difficult. At best, this Presidency has been sadly irrelevant. Luis de Grandes Pascual,

Mr President, Mr Kallas, this is a directive that affects all customs formalities that apply to ships arriving in or departing from ports. Thus, it will favour short-distance maritime transport and will contribute to modal balance. The aim, ladies and gentlemen, is to reduce and simplify the amount of information and number of documentation and physical controls carried out by ships with respect to goods. At present, this information must be provided and these controls carried out repeatedly. The attitude of the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, who I would like to congratulate for his work, has been intelligent and open to dialogue. Particularly, as a shadow rapporteur, I feel represented in the final document and satisfied that my contributions have been taken on board. This is a process that has grown with time, during the course of which agreements were gradually reached, ranging from its adoption by the Committee on Transport and Tourism to the trialogue held on 7 June. The end result has been the consensus reached between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The agreements have covered some very important issues, to which the rapporteur and Commissioner Kallas have already referred. In my opinion, the compromise solutions reached with respect to the issue of the languages used, the time limit for its entry into force, and the one-stop shop, are balanced and worthy of support. I think a good job has been done. I would like to congratulate Mr Sterckx and believe the goals set for us by the Commission have been fully met. Moreover, I feel that we should be pleased about having reached this agreement between the three parties, the three institutions. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 Mr President, in my opinion, this excellent report sets out the guidelines that must inspire the new White Paper on Transport that will shape European transport policy for the next 10 years. This report includes several issues that are worth outlining: the need for a financial fund as an essential instrument; the challenge of the growing demands of freight transport; the search for comodal solutions that make users and freight safe; the vital need for sufficient and secure rest areas for road transport; the – in my opinion, correct – diagnosis that the various modes of transport must complement each other, with efficiency criteria being sought rather than merely being in competition with each other; and the rapporteur’s – brave, in my opinion, and fair – assertion that transport by rail or sea is not always more environmentally friendly than road transport. In short, the concept of ‘efficient comodality’ is a concept for the future and it must certainly, in my opinion, be given full support. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Kallas for being here and for the work that he has done during this difficult time. This is a debate that had to take place, ladies and gentlemen, and unfortunately, I think it will not be the last of its kind. I will spare you any repeats of the statistics of this serious event and the negative impact that it has had on the economy. I simply wish to remember those who were affected. Firstly, there were the passengers. Ten million people were left without flights and with no guidance as to what to do. The impact on passengers was so great that the provisions of directives and regulations could not protect them. The exclusion of liability in contracts due to catastrophe or force majeure
 brings to mind the need for a joint fund to tackle the consequences of a global disaster such as that caused by the volcano. I now come to the airlines. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that they lost EUR 1 700 million worldwide. The Association of European Airlines (AEA) assesses the loss at EUR 850 million at European level. This blow was all that they needed to accentuate a spiralling crisis that is threatening many airlines with closure. The other victim has been tourism. The consequences for tourism have been devastating. Firstly, due to the cancellation of contracts that had been made in advance, as is usual in this sector, and secondly, due to insecurity, which has caused a change in normal booking trends. This is my diagnosis, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. There can only be one conclusion: the European institutions do not have the tools to effectively tackle a crisis of this magnitude. Now I come to the criticism, because criticism is necessary and inevitable; self-criticism, if necessary. No one can be exonerated, because everyone involved acted badly, late and inefficiently, sometimes through no fault of their own. The Member States cannot be exonerated because, although the decisions were within their competence, they were still unable to act. The European institutions cannot be exonerated because they took four long days to react, and because their reaction, which invoked safety as their priority, did not unfortunately produce calm, but paralysis. I will now discuss the Commission’s response. Today, the Commission is reiterating the measures that it had announced to us. In my view, they are reasonable measures, but there is a lack of clarity about the timescale for implementing them. We are not talking about something in the past. Even today, there is a latent threat of flights being grounded, and it is concerning that we are dependent on air currents. I know that we cannot fight the elements. This was said by a famous Spanish sailor regarding a big naval battle that we lost. The crisis will not help us to take measures. The Member States will be reluctant to provide resources. If we are mean, however, this volcano could do more damage to the European economy than is being forecast. I ask the Commission to be determined, and I ask the Council to urgently tackle the need to take decisions. I ask everyone to be generous in implementing alternatives to make up for the incapacities of the institutions. I do not hold the Commission or the Council responsible, but we need to acknowledge the diagnosis that the institutions have not been capable, as they currently stand, of solving a crisis of this magnitude and proportions.

 Mr Zapatero, for a Spaniard, such as I am, it is an honour to greet you here, as you take your turn as the President of the European Union. This is a period of many expectations and challenges and, of course, we must not fail to live up to those expectations. It is important that our citizens see that our updated institutions are capable of providing solutions to real problems. You know that we agree with the programme you have put forward. You know that, for the Spanish Partido Popular
, this is a question of state and that we will be behind you in everything that we regard as being in the common interests of Europe and that is important to Spain. It is an ambitious programme and, hopefully, a programme full of content. I hope that in this album of the Spanish Presidency – since it will surely be colourful and varied – people can see every event as a milestone in the very real problems that affect them. The crisis is hitting economies and unemployment seems like the fifth horse of the Apocalypse. You have had the honesty to recognise that there is 20% unemployment in Spain, but that does not curtail you. I believe that it obliges us all to come up with a solution to a problem that we must solve together. It is a real problem. The time available does not allow me to say too much, Prime Minister. However, I do want to tell you that Spain faces many challenges ahead, that I am certain of Spain’s capability as a nation and that I want to believe and am sure that you will rise to the challenge. At this time in Europe, we must not fail to live up to these expectations On the other hand, the globalised world – and you have referred to it with intelligence – means that new centres of power are emerging and it is necessary for the European Union to take a more active and coherent role in defence of its values and interests. Otherwise, we run the risk of becoming irrelevant. Finally, Prime Minister, we Spanish will not accept being denied the ability to make proposals. We have that right. We must also have the humility to accept the advice that Don Quixote gave to Sancho Panza when he recommended humility in his fantasy about governing the Isle of Barataria.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain has just endured a painful situation in which a vessel, the Alakrana,
 and all its crew were subjected to blackmail, humiliation and countless risks. The Spanish Government is being called to account in Spain, as is appropriate in the case. In this House, we are going to talk of Europe and more Europe. Accordingly, it has to be stated that after a year in which we have demanded diplomacy and determination, the outcome has been positive. Operation Atalanta is inadequate, however. It needs to be broadened and made more flexible. It has to become possible to protect not only the routes along which humanitarian aid moves, but also Community fishing and merchant vessels. The latter must be protected, and that is why, in the resolution to be adopted tomorrow, we shall call on the European Parliament and on its institutions to make certain commitments. What we are seeking to do is to say ‘yes’ to the strong stance taken by states that protect their vessels with their armed forces to deter and, if necessary, legally repel pirate action. We must say ‘no’ to recourse to private security contractors, a move which, according to the IMO, carries with it the risk of unnecessary violence. We must say ‘no’ to the passive and dilettante attitude of governments that are making life easy for the pirates. We must say ‘yes’, however, to diplomacy, ‘yes’ to aid to Somalia, and ‘no’ to unsubstantiated charges of alleged illegal fishing. Community vessels are fishing in compliance with our international agreements. They are doing so legally and must be protected. The Community's institutions are duty bound to do so.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank you for being here this morning and also congratulate you on the good job you have done with the publication of the Single Market Act II. I would also like to applaud the work of Ms Bastos, which is correct and certainly necessary. I believe that the 12 proposals included in the act will surely constitute a major boost to the single market, and I especially welcome the inclusion of the creation of a genuine digital single market among those priorities. This year we are celebrating 20 years of the single market: 20 years of prosperity during which as Europeans we have expanded the opportunities available to our businesses and to the public. However, if we want to continue making progress and to be able to meet the forthcoming challenges of technological changes and developments, and ensure that our economy continues to be competitive in the global market, I firmly believe that, just as in the 1980s and 1990s we developed and established the four fundamental freedoms, now the main goal we must achieve is to create a true, genuine digital single market. I know, Commissioner, due to our close cooperation over the last two years, that the digital market is a priority for you. I would like to take this opportunity to once again offer my support so that we may continue the same cooperation between the Commission and Parliament that we have had so far in order to make the digital single market a reality. Exactly two weeks ago the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the report on completing the Digital Single Market by a very large majority. I believe it is vital that both Parliament and the Commission convey to the Council the need to move forward with the recommendations in both documents and that we continue to work very closely in order to put them into effect. Pablo Arias Echeverría  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the three Commissioners for being here today. We are experiencing a crisis that can only be overcome by reviving trade. There is no doubt that SMEs are the pillar underpinning the European economy and there is no doubt that we need more Europe and less market fragmentation. The digital revolution offers us many possibilities, and one of these is, without any doubt, electronic commerce. An increasing number of consumers buy online, but they only do so at a national level – things are more complicated at a European level. Market barriers do not help, and electronic commerce is almost non-existent at this pan-European level. In my opinion, and I have said this several times, the way out of the crisis is digital, and the time has come to go from poetry to prose. It is time for action. Our SMEs need concrete measures to increase their pan-European options and to develop their full potential in a market of more than 500 million consumers. Consumers, meanwhile, need a pan-European market that offers sufficient guarantees to allow them to trust in a true digital single market, in which they can buy products in the knowledge that their rights are assured, with freedom of choice and at a good price. The Consumer Rights Directive is a good first step. I would like to know what next steps the Commission has in mind with regard to copyright, data protection, VAT, accounting rules, a single domain for online transactions, conflict resolution, product shipping, etc. Pablo Arias Echeverría  (PPE

 Madam President, I would just like to say a word about the Working Group on e-Commerce. Thank you very much for your answer, Commissioner. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) has a Working Group on e-Commerce, and we would like you to take part in this so that we can discuss these proposals in greater depth and find out about the specific measures, enabling the IMCO Committee to gain a proper understanding of them.

Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the communication that you have presented to us. I think it is a good initiative in order to continue working to improve the single European market. I consider it vital that the 50 proposals that you referred to in your speech be debated. I hope that in Parliament, I will be able to play an active role in helping to overcome barriers to e-commerce in Europe. Many of the current barriers to e-commerce have already been detected, and there are even specific proposals for overcoming them. We could say that we are reliant on political will to resolve those barriers. I think that this communication is a good start, and I therefore think we should support it by playing an active role. Pablo Arias Echeverría,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES) 
Mr President, as you all know, the Internet and new technologies represent an unprecedented revolution that means that we need to modernise the mechanisms that regulate e-commerce in our economy in order to be able to tackle the challenges that we are facing. Just a few years ago, the new systems for trade over the Internet, and the new technologies and opportunities we have available to us now, did not exist. They are now a fact, however, and soon they will be an essential tool. As legislators, we need to be broad-minded enough to create tools for the public that solve the problems of today, but which foresee and can be adapted to the problems of tomorrow. This is a commitment that we must make and a responsibility that we are obliged to take on. We must prepare the way for what is to come and for those who are to come, and this means we need to overcome the obstacles to achieving that goal. E-commerce is a tool available to us with enormous potential for relaunching and improving the competitiveness of our economy and also for strengthening the internal market. It is a tool that can create a great deal of added value and offer great opportunities to the European people and businesses in this time of crisis. It is vital that the leaders of the European Union implement the necessary measures to overcome the existing barriers to cross-border e-commerce in Europe and that we generate confidence in this medium, simplify it and make the rules governing it transparent. That is the only way to ensure that the public and businesses will be able to reap the rewards of its enormous potential. That is the only way that we can be competitive in a global market that waits for no one. Either we take the necessary measures energetically, decisively and with leadership, or our competitors will leave us behind. The report that I am presenting today proposes measures for overcoming the barriers to cross-border trade. We have the opportunity not only to prepare the internal market for e-commerce, but also to help to complement the internal market through e-commerce. The measures that I propose in the report are aimed at improving the quality of access to the Internet in Europe, improving consumer confidence by creating a European quality mark, increasing monitoring and supervision of the network and conducting information campaigns so that users are aware of their rights and know how and where to complain if they have problems. They are also aimed at protecting the private property and personal data of users, promoting the development of initiatives that incentivise businesses to sell their products online, improving payment systems and simplifying the rules regarding the payment of taxes, among other measures. Finally, in this plan, I felt I needed to highlight the need to improve protection for minors using the Internet. I believe that all these measures are essential for promoting e-commerce and for adapting the rules that currently govern it to a future in which we are already living. We have an obligation to offer mechanisms to the market that make our businesses more competitive and strengthen our economies. This plan is undoubtedly a platform on which we can continue to build without any obstacles or hindrances. For these reasons, I would like to ask this House for its support to move forward with this initiative. Pablo Arias Echeverría  (PPE

Mr President, we all recognise the importance of this report and the efforts made by the rapporteur to achieve a consensus, and I would therefore firstly like to congratulate Ms Thyssen. This House has called on previous occasions for the establishment of an integrated financial framework, budgetary framework and economic policy framework. At the Council in June the guidelines and roadmap were agreed, which we must now begin to follow. It is now the time to do what was agreed. The first step is banking union based on three pillars. Firstly, a single supervisor, which is the key to breaking the circle between banking debt and sovereign debt; a second pillar based on the common deposit guarantee mechanism; and a third pillar based on a common bank crisis resolution system. These are three basic pillars in order finally to begin to generate stability and confidence. In this sense, I support the European Central Bank taking on as soon as possible the powers to act as single independent supervisor over all banks, obviously with the cooperation of the national authorities. With regard to direct recapitalisation of banks, I support what was adopted at the Council in June, in which the possibility was confirmed of a direct injection of cash into the banks once the single supervisor begins operation. In addition, fiscal union is the other goal that must be achieved in the medium term, in order to achieve an authentic and genuine economic and monetary union. In the same way, as a culmination of this whole process, we should move towards some sort of mutualisation of debt, in order to put an end once and for all to the differences in interest rates due to the doubts generated regarding the euro area. What is most important in all of this is what I said at the start: to do what we have agreed, therefore I reiterate my full support for the rapporteur. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am addressing the House with the simple aim of highlighting the importance of the European Semester as a tool for detecting the weaknesses in our system and for exercising the democratic legitimacy that Parliament represents. Following the beginning of the crisis, and thanks to the implementation of these mechanisms, we are succeeding in analysing its causes in order to lay the foundations for greater EU integration, which is the only response and the only option for bringing an end to the crisis and ensuring that this type of crisis cannot happen again. The semester represents the desire for coordination that we have been so much lacking so far in order to jointly manage our needs as Europeans. The tools related to the European Semester, the Annual Growth Survey and the Country-Specific Recommendations create greater stability for all Member States and deepen their knowledge. The report, presented by Mr Gauzès, which is the result of very hard work, reflects their value. Nevertheless, we must continue to promote greater coordination between our policies until we create not only true economic union, but true political union. This does not mean that agreements do not have to be fulfilled, but must be a further incentive for the EU to speak with once voice. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by underlining my support for free trade agreements as a fundamental means of stimulating the much-longed-for and much-needed economic growth and the creation of jobs. These agreements also boost relations with our allies, in this instance Japan.  The former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama recently stated in an article in the Wall Street Journal
 that both Brussels and Tokyo had strong ties with Washington, but that the ties between Brussels and Tokyo were not so strong. I agree with him that this agreement could be an opportunity to redress this imbalance.  Nevertheless, at a time when we are considering launching negotiations to conclude a free trade agreement with Japan, I believe that the European Union’s trade strategy should be in keeping with its industrial strategy and I would like to know the Commissioner’s opinion on this point.  In addition, if we want industry’s share of GDP to rise from the current 16 % to 20 %, as proposed in the Europe 2020 agenda, it would make sense, in my opinion, to listen to the concerns of industry itself when it comes to trade policy. The automotive industry is undoubtedly of key importance in this respect. We should therefore listen to its concerns and work with it to ensure that this agreement becomes a reality as soon as possible. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, firstly, I believe it is appropriate to congratulate Commissioner Barnier on his hard work and the great passion he is putting into this project. We are again faced with a decisive moment for the euro. There can be no more delays. We have to progress towards true economic and monetary union, and ultimately, true political union. There is no going back. We will all agree that banking union is the first basic and essential step towards political union. There are three main pillars of this banking union. The first is a single supervisory authority, which supervises all banks in the euro area, and it is even more important that it comes into force as soon as possible. The second is a common deposit guarantee fund. The third is a banking crisis management mechanism. We also need the option to be able to directly recapitalise banks when required, to break, as mentioned by Commissioner Barnier, the vicious circle between banking debt and sovereign debt, and to finally overcome the debt crisis. This is the real deal. There is no going back on the euro. The Spanish Government has made a proposal, an ambitious proposal, in this respect. This was born out of the Spanish Government’s commitment to Europe and the euro. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the expected adoption of the amendments to the safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas is a key step towards Parliament adopting the two agreements with Central America, Colombia and Peru. Those agreements are essential for the future of the European Union. These clauses, along with the progress made by Colombia, acknowledged by the political resolution adopted by this House on 13 June, as well as the support of the Central American countries and Peru for this regulation, should provide the final approval for the ratification of those agreements. These clauses will allow our producers to progressively adapt to a free-trade framework that will benefit us all. At a time when the United States and Asian countries are signing free-trade agreements with American countries, such as the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) or the agreements between the United States and Colombia and Peru, respectively, we cannot allow the leading trading power in the world, the European Union, to continue to miss opportunities. In this sense, I share the concern of the European business sector at the delay in these agreements coming into force. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, almost all of us agree that the way to exit the crisis is through austerity and reforms to instigate growth. We should not fall into the false debate of austerity versus growth: austerity is a key tool and required in order to achieve the goal of economic growth. In this respect, Spain is an example, an example of a country committed to fiscal consolidation and reforms. To achieve this, Europe must focus on the formation of fiscal policy measures that will ensure austerity as well as growth and job creation, but the European Central Bank needs, more than ever, to instigate a monetary policy that allows for the acceleration of the effects of the implemented structural reforms. The ‘policy mix’ is of key importance, today more than ever. There is a need to underpin the adopted fiscal measures with a more relaxed monetary policy that means that the aforementioned measures and reforms have the quickest possible effect: over 20 million unemployed people in Europe are waiting.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank both the European Commission and the governments of Colombia and Peru for the great efforts made to successfully reach this agreement. I give my full support to an agreement that will undoubtedly benefit both regions, both Colombia and Peru, and will help to improve human rights conditions in Colombia. This agreement is an example for a key region for the European Union, as is South America. I am concerned about another agreement, however, one that the Commission is about to start negotiating. The Commission should show that it roundly defends the legal security of the investments that are made, which are so important in improving trade flow between both parties. I would like to take this opportunity, therefore, to ask Commissioner De Gucht about the measures being considered when it comes to the Repsol YPF issue. As has been the case with the agreement with Colombia and Peru which we are debating here, the best guarantee to reach a possible successful agreement with Mercosur would be a strong and decisive response from the European Union when it comes to the Repsol case. We should not allow our allies on the other side of the Atlantic to be more robust than we are when it comes to an issue that affects Europe. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,

 Mr President, Mr Šemeta, the last European Council meeting focused on the need to improve the taxation system in order to improve tax collection efficiency and put a stop to tax evasion and tax fraud. Spain will introduce a law on this matter. The ideas that have been put forward by the Council and given expression in this resolution are priorities of Spain’s economic policy and, I am certain, that of the rest of Europe as well. They will enable us to bring about legal certainty, reduce the informal economy and lower the number of people who are not fulfilling their tax obligations; this will be sure to create a fairer Europe. Furthermore, we should bear in mind the recommendations made by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the principle of trying to eliminate or reduce to a minimum the comparative disadvantage between those who have fulfilled their taxation obligations and those who do not fulfil them. The resolution we shall vote on in plenary and the Spanish plan to prevent and combat tax fraud therefore seek to fight against the informal economy, promote transparency and European coordination, boost tax collection – enabling the deficit to be reduced, which is so badly needed at the moment – and not damage opportunities for growth but, on the contrary, create a fairer and more efficient system that reflects those opportunities. Those decisions will have a very positive impact on the public accounts and, I insist, will make a significant contribution to reducing the deficit and, therefore, to restoring growth. Finally, while we are talking about growth, I want to take this opportunity to stress that, in order to achieve the growth we so badly want, we should continue to pledge our commitment to internationalising our economy and our businesses, as the Council has stated many times. To achieve that, however, we need to guarantee the legal certainty of our investments, but I do not want to speak ahead of the debate we shall have later.

 Mr President, firstly, Ms Muñiz, the Spanish Government has not passed any tax amnesty laws because, as you are aware, that concept is not included in the Spanish constitution. It is true that the Spanish Government has proposed regularisation, as other countries such as Belgium and Germany have done, as well as other Spanish governments of your own political affiliation – that is, the Socialist Party, a few years ago.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my third speech in the House so far this year on this issue and I am sorry to stick to the same refrain but, as my fellow countryman, Miguel de Unamuno, used to say: ‘to strike the nail once, you must strike the horseshoe a hundred times’. Furthermore, I want to repeat the call to actively implement the measures that have been agreed in the last few Councils. As the President of the Commission has said, we need to finish the job. We need growth, ladies and gentlemen. With austerity, we will manage to create stability and confidence, but we also have to emerge from the crisis and create work and well-being once more. We need to commit to urgent implementation of the measures that were agreed upon in the last few Councils to incentivise growth. These measures must be accompanied by reforms. Spain is clearly committed to this spirit of reform. In less than 100 days, we have passed three key reforms: budgetary stability, financial reform and labour reform and this spirit of reform does not end here. As Mariano Rajoy says, the Spanish Government not only announces reforms, it carries them out, which is a different thing altogether. Let us follow its example. Let us not announce plans for growth, let us implement them. Furthermore, we need a degree of adaptability to circumstances given that we live in a world of constant change and evolution. As the President of the government of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, said recently before the House and as the Economy Minister, Luis de Guindos confirmed today, Spain is fulfilling its duties and will continue to do so. Spain is more committed than ever to Europe. It has demonstrated this right from the start, putting its cards on the table and standing by its desire to comply with what has been agreed.

 Mr President, Commissioner, after the Council meetings held recently, Adenauer’s statement that ‘we all live under the same sky, but we do not all have the same horizon’, appears to be losing clout in favour of the construction of this common area, the European Union. The most important issue remains, however, in that we should actively implement all the measures agreed during recent Council meetings. Up to now, the austerity measures appear to have been applied most speedily. I will insist as many times as is necessary in this plenary, however, that we are not getting anywhere by only applying austerity; we need growth. These tough but essential adjustment programmes have to go hand in hand with the necessary reforms to generate growth and employment. Up to now, Spain has been at the forefront of this comprehensive austerity and reform plan. The three major reforms that were approved – ‘budgetary stability’, ‘reform of the financial system’ and ‘labour reform’ – testify to that. These reforms have merited the acknowledgement of different governments and media, despite the obstacles being placed in their way by launching unfounded rumours. The latter began with sport and yesterday threatened to spread into our economy and our politics. Let us continue to work for the same horizon. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, congratulations on your appointment. Prime Minister, we are celebrating the decisions adopted during the last Council, but it is my hope and wish that they do not remain mere words, but that they also become actions and come to fruition as soon as possible. We must send a solid message to the markets. Up to now, they have been very welcoming of the measures. Furthermore, there is a sense of eagerness for cooperation and a spirit of willingness, both of which we will continue to have great need of over the coming months. We must maintain and continue to consolidate our efforts in favour of stability and continue to put our trust in austerity measures, but these must be accompanied by other measures to generate growth and, therefore, employment. We cannot recover from this crisis through austerity measures alone. We need to bring reforms to fruition, not just debate them. Spain is showing that it is fully committed to this idea. That is why we are supporting the structural reforms that must be implemented by the Member States. The European Central Bank, for its part, has demonstrated courage when taking decisions, but it must show greater commitment through more active participation in the secondary debt markets. Furthermore, the common financial mechanisms that have been debated at such length in this House must be implemented. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Madam President, this question is for Vice-President Tajani. We all realise how important professional mobility is in building a versatile, competitive workforce. In fact, two of the pillars of the Europe 2020 strategy are innovation and entrepreneurship. Mr Vice-President, as you know, we currently have Erasmus for undergraduates, the Marie Curie programme for researchers and Erasmus for entrepreneurs. I think it would also be necessary to design a programme to provide cross-cutting opportunities to young innovators so that they can carry out their projects not only in universities but also in companies, start-ups, laboratories or government agencies. The members of the European Parliament Youth Intergroup have put forward a proposal to undertake a project entitled ‘Young Innovators Mobility’, which sets out to achieve just that. Mr Vice-President, I would like to know whether this initiative has the Commission’s support. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Madam President, in paragraph 2 of Article 9a, after the words ‘at the request of a Member State’, we would like to add the phrase ‘any legal person or any association not having legal personality acting on behalf of the Union industry’. The reason is to make this regulation consistent with other safeguards that we have approved, such as the South Korea FTA safeguard clause. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner De Gucht, early in this parliamentary term, which is my first, one of the matters I first heard discussed was precisely the Free Trade Agreement with Korea. Certain sectors of European industry, especially the automotive industry, were unanimous in opposing this agreement. As a citizen of Navarre and Spain, where the automotive industry represents a substantial part of our economy, I felt the duty to become involved in order to improve, if not the agreement as this was no longer possible, the safeguard clause, which was where Parliament could introduce improvements. Thus, we set out to achieve two objectives. Firstly, to protect the industry and its jobs, and secondly, to make the agreement more attractive for the industries concerned, particularly the automotive industry. Our aim was not just to avoid outright rejection, but to gain their support for the agreement. I believe that here today, we can say ‘mission accomplished’. This is all thanks to Parliament’s hard work and expertise. I should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteurs of both reports for their outstanding work. Thank you Robert. And thank you also for your words. Recognition is also due to the members of the Committee on International Trade, led by its Chair, Mr Moreira. ¡Muito obrigado!
, Vital. I would also like to thank the Belgian Presidency of the European Union for their excellent work. Their effort has had its reward in the form of the agreement we finally reached in December. Lastly, I would like to highlight the work of the European Commission, and particularly Ignacio Bercero’s contribution, for which I am most grateful. Tomorrow we will vote in favour of a clause which will be more effective, easier to apply and will genuinely protect European industry. Today, concerns on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea have hugely diminished. Indeed, we might say that they have all but vanished. Today, the opportunities this agreement brings clearly outweigh the uncertainties. The European Parliament should be proud of a job well done. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, I would first like to clarify that I am in favour of strengthening trade links between the European Union and Papua New Guinea that promote the development of the region, but it must be sustainable development. I sincerely believe that this agreement, as it currently stands, is not a good one. I am entirely against one clause of the agreement, which I consider to be unfair: the exemption from the rules of origin, because not only does it endanger the sustainable development of Papua New Guinea, but, as we have heard here today, it endangers a whole European industry: the canning industry. This concession should have been absolutely exceptional, and it should not have been applied in the case of Papua New Guinea. Moreover, let us not forget the serious precedent that this measure is setting, and will set, for future European Union negotiations. In my opinion, there needed to be a much clearer and firmer resolution in this respect, stating categorically that, at the next review of the Interim Partnership Agreement, the exemption from the rules of origin will be permanently suspended. I therefore want to ask the Commission to take into account the dramatic consequences that this concession is going to have, firstly, for the European canning industry, and secondly, for the sustainability of the environment and natural resources of Papua New Guinea, and the very negative precedent being set for future negotiations. However much the Commission has said that it will not be a precedent, the pressure will be there. I therefore ask the Commission to decide to put an end to the exemption from the rules of origin as soon as possible. Pablo Zalba Bidegain, 
 rapporteur.

Mr President, the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea will open up opportunities for both European and Korean industry, but in order to prevent any negative effects on European industry, it is essential to have an effective safeguard clause. All the political groups unanimously decided last week that the time had come for Parliament to take a position in plenary on the amendments adopted by 27 votes in favour and just one abstention in the Committee on International Trade in June, which are vital in order for the safeguard clause to be applicable and effective. As you are aware, we are going to vote solely on the amendments and, in accordance with Rule 57, we will defer the vote on the legislative report to the second part-session in October. At the same time, we unanimously decided not to close the door on a possible agreement at first reading, which we firmly believe will be possible. However, in order to do so, it is vitally important that we send a clear signal of unity and strength from all the political groups. That is why it is important for Parliament as a whole to strongly support the whole package of amendments. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,  
rapporteur. 
– (ES) 
Mr President, Commissioner, President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea will open up opportunities for both European and Korean industry. However, in order to prevent any negative effects on European industry, it is essential to have an effective safeguard clause. That is what my colleagues and I have been working on over the past few months in the Committee on International Trade, which is why it is important for Parliament as a whole to strongly support the whole package of amendments. The report was adopted by 27 votes in favour and one abstention in June. Under this clause, it will be possible to apply safeguard measures if the reductions to the customs duties on products imported from South Korea threaten to cause serious damage to European industry. As you know, under the new powers given to Parliament following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the adoption of this regulation is following the ordinary legislative procedure. Unfortunately, it was not possible to hold a trialogue with a mandate from the Council before the summer recess. The first official trialogue was held on 30 August, and both the shadow rapporteurs and I were able to hear the Council’s reaction to our amendments. That meeting enabled us to move forward on many points and define the final text of some paragraphs, and our feeling following the meeting is that we believe the Council genuinely wants to reach an agreement on the most controversial points and is working hard to do so. This is, of course, something that we view very positively. However, at the same time, we do not think there has been time to sufficiently clarify the Council’s position on the points on which it has a different view to that adopted in the Committee on International Trade. All the political groups therefore unanimously decided that the time had come for Parliament to take a position in plenary on the amendments adopted in the Committee on International Trade in July, which are vital in order for the safeguard clause to be applicable and effective. At the same time, a unanimous decision was taken not to close the door on a possible agreement at first reading, which we firmly believe will be possible when the Council clarifies its position. We will therefore vote tomorrow only on the amendments tabled by the Committee on International Trade and, in accordance with Rule 55, we will defer the vote on the legislative report to the second part-session in October, when we hope to reach a positive conclusion to the legislative procedure. We believe that the report incorporates a whole series of improvements such as creating an on-line platform to speed up the processes; the possibility of the industry being able to initiate an investigation process; the Commission being obliged to produce reports; and improvements in the monitoring and surveillance of Korean imports. These are points on which we have already reached an agreement in principle with the Council. I think this is a good result, but we still do not think it is enough. There are other, even more fundamental points that deserve the full attention of the negotiators and which all the political groups must defend here, as we did in the Committee on International Trade. I am essentially talking about four points. Firstly, we need to mitigate the possible risk to the more vulnerable Member States by establishing a regional clause, region by region, to prevent some sensitive industries from being affected. We should not forget that the safeguard clause is essentially temporary and its objective is precisely to safeguard the most sensitive sectors of the economy so that they have sufficient time to adapt to the new situation. Secondly, we need to clearly establish surveillance for the products affected by the duty drawback clause. Thirdly, we need to defend Parliament’s role in the process of initiating investigations, and the final point is the decision-making process or comitology. As well as mentioning the good will shown by the Belgian Presidency during the negotiations, finally, I want to mention the vital role that the Commission is playing and will continue to play in bringing the negotiations to a sound conclusion.

Madam President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their kind words. Commissioner De Gucht, as we have heard here today, the European Parliament is making its position very clear. As one fellow Member said, this is an historic moment that will set a precedent and this is an historic report that will set a precedent for future agreements. Parliament wants to reach an agreement at first reading and will do everything it can to achieve that. As one of my fellow Members said, this is a key moment for European industry, which needs the new incentives and new markets that this agreement is bound to bring. This is also, however, a delicate time for employment, and we need to guarantee employment in Europe. We also need to guarantee that this agreement does not damage European industry, and in order to do so, we need a strong safeguard clause such as the one adopted by the Committee on International Trade, which will probably be endorsed and strengthened by Parliament’s votes tomorrow. It is therefore now time for the Council and also the Commission to act. The Commission must continue to support us, and we appeal to both institutions to take responsibility. I want to stress that we will seek to reach an agreement at first reading, but we need to get moving. I believe that it is possible, and we await the proposals. Pable Zalba Bidegain,

Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that we must see Latin America as a hugely important trade partner. We believe that negotiations should be reopened for the agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which affects 700 million people and will be the most ambitious bi-regional agreement in the world. We also believe that negotiations concerning the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit, which is to be held in May. We also need to develop the association agreements with Mexico and Chile, which have been a real success. We must therefore express our satisfaction at the conclusion of the free trade agreement with Colombia, which is going to be very beneficial both to Europe and to the Latin American country. We believe that Parliament’s job now is to ratify these agreements in due time and to ensure that no country in the Andean Community that wishes to conclude an agreement is excluded. We, of course, also believe that free trade agreements can and should also be a useful tool for promoting the development of citizens’ rights and freedoms. Lastly, we believe that the path to follow in the future is, on the one hand, to develop the European Union’s agreements with the various countries and regional groups and, on the other, to promote inter-regional integration agreements within Latin America itself. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is very clear as far as the European Union’s trade policy is concerned. We are firm defenders of free trade and it is certainly vital that Europe continues negotiating trade agreements with other countries because they generate new opportunities for European companies, that is to say, new jobs, which are very much required in light of the serious current economic crisis. I did very much like your words Commissioner, because I also believe that it is very important that these agreements contain sufficient guarantees to avoid signing clauses which are unbalanced and unfair for European industry. The agreement with South Korea has been put forward by the Commission as the first in a new generation of more ambitious trade agreements for Europe, hence the importance of this agreement. It is not a question of whether it is a small country or not; it is a question of not weakening our capacity for negotiation in future agreements with much larger countries. Therefore, we are not against the South Korea free trade agreement; however, we do want certain paragraphs to be studied more rigorously, which we believe create unfair competitive disadvantages for certain European industrial sectors and give Korean producers an unfair advantage. Commissioner, I want you to clearly explain to me why the safeguard clause for the duty drawback enters into force in five years. On the last opportunity I had to speak to you, you stated that the reason was that tariffs on vehicles were also dismantled after five years. The agreement stipulates that they will dismantle the tariffs for vehicles which weigh more than five tonnes after five years. However, for vehicles which weigh less than five tonnes, which are all standard vehicles, the 10% tariff will be dismantled in three years. What is the reason for this two-year time lapse Commissioner? I would also like to receive more details regarding any updates on this aspect you mentioned. What is the point of correcting these problems ex post 
when the whole reason for having a safeguard clause is to anticipate possible negative consequences? Pilar Ayuso  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, the agreement reached by Parliament and the Council reflects what was unanimously approved by the Member States concerned in the International Maritime Organisation. These seas have disconcerting levels of acidification. Moreover, their capacity for regeneration is very limited. The fuels required are going to be more expensive, and therefore there are plans for financial aid for businesses, which is very reasonable. Some Members, however, have sought to have the requirements for new fuels applied to all the Union’s seas. We would find ourselves with a paradox in that we would be trying to solve an environmental problem of some Member States by creating a major economic problem in the Mediterranean, which does not have that environmental problem, but does have other environmental problems, the costs of which we are not seeking to impose on the other Member States. The Treaty is very clear. Sensitive areas must be protected. However, not all areas are equally sensitive. Pilar Ayuso,

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Ms Auconie for her hard work and efforts to reach a consensus. With regard to the two issues at hand, I must say that I entirely agree with the Commission’s proposal on the electronic identification of beef. However, I cannot say the same for the voluntary beef labelling system. The Commission’s proposal to delete this provision is neither appropriate nor correct. Specifically, this labelling system has played a very important role in restoring European consumers’ confidence in beef and products derived from beef. In my view, the argument being put forward by the Commission regarding a heavy administrative burden is not valid at present, as the operational mechanism is perfectly familiar to the authorities and the sector. Proof that the mechanism is working very well can be found in the fact that in my country, for example, 180 requests for beef labelling have been approved, as opposed to just 32 for goat meat and 55 for poultry and eggs. Voluntary labelling is a highly effective tool for making a distinction between varieties of a product, and consumers want to be informed about what they are buying and consuming. However, consumers do not distinguish between voluntary and mandatory labelling, and they often consider voluntary labelling to be more important and more relevant than mandatory labelling. All of this information combined is what enables them to make informed choices. Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 is by no means perfect, but it is nevertheless much better than the legal vacuum that could be created if Articles 16, 17 and 18 are deleted, because we would be faced with a new system with no prior warning and no mandatory external control. One possible solution to improve the system would be to establish specific sectoral standards for beef, as already exist for other products, such as those in the chicken and poultry sector. I believe the Commission is in the process of doing so. Lastly, I would like to point out that labelling plays a vital role in consumer decision making, and this is precisely what we have defended in Parliament. It is therefore very hard to understand why we should now want to abolish it. Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to draw attention to the excellent work done by Ms McAvan, the rapporteur, and also the other shadow rapporteurs, in order to reach this agreement at first reading. This was very important because the regulation we adopted in 2010 was coming into force and it needed to be amended. It was not amended because it was a flawed piece of legislation – quite the contrary. Rather, it was amended because, as has been said, recent events took place, of which we are all aware, showing that there was a loophole that needed to be closed in order for it not to occur again. It was also necessary to strengthen certain specific points concerning pharmacovigilance and the safety of medicines once placed on the market. As we have already heard, from now on, marketing authorisation holders who do not renew a marketing authorisation or who withdraw or request the withdrawal or suspension of an authorisation will be obliged to inform the competent authorities of the real reasons and motives for withdrawing or suspending it. This is a major success for transparency and it will prevent the market authorisation holder from trying to conceal the real reasons behind its decision. Moreover, in the event that any of these actions is carried out in a third country, all the Member States in which that medicine is marketed must be informed. All this will improve transparency and safety, without the European Medicines Agency and national agencies being overly burdened as a result. The second important amendment we have achieved is that all authorised products that are subject to some kind of post-authorisation safety study (PASS) will be systematically included on the list of products subject to such monitoring. Lastly, we cannot forget that pharmacovigilance plays a fundamental role, and Parliament should therefore adopt this proposal. Pilar Ayuso,

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Perello on the enormous amount of work he has done, on his readiness to collaborate with all the shadow rapporteurs, and also to congratulate the shadow rapporteurs on the way they have all worked with each other. I also praise the Polish Presidency and the Commission for their efforts to reach an agreement on first reading. Parliament, the Council and the Commission have had divergent positions, sometimes very different, on several issues, and this made the agreement far from easy and not fully satisfactory to everyone, but we can say that it is reasonably satisfactory. The point that must be highlighted in the amendment of this directive, as already stated, is that, from now on, sugar may not be added to either pressed or concentrated juices. However, fruit nectars will be products sweetened with sugar, honey or sweeteners. It is clear that the average consumer is unaware of this legislation and, therefore, of the difference between juices and nectars. For this reason, I feel that the agreement between the three institutions to put a statement on packaging for a limited period to say that fruit juices do not contain sugar will not only help consumers to tell the difference between two products, but also make them much better informed. The objective of this initiative was to amend Directive 2001/112/EC for the second time, bringing it into line with technical progress and the developments in international regulations relating to the Codex Alimentarius. However, despite the support of all the farming organisations in the Union, as already mentioned, the Council and the Commission, surprisingly, have rejected the possibility of mandarin juice being added to orange juice in amounts less than 10% and mandarin appearing on the list of ingredients, as permitted by the Codex Alimentarius (STAN 45-1981), given that this is common practice in Brazil and the United States, from which we import a large amount of concentrates. In this regard, another area of conflict during the negotiations was the restoration of flavour, pulp and cells lost during the juice and nectar extraction process. All sides agreed, during the negotiations, to maintain the Commission’s original proposal on restoring flavours, pulp and cells from the same fruit species. However, some members of my political group are going to vote against this report for precisely this reason. Lastly, I would like to mention two things that worry me. Firstly, imported products marketed within the European Union are not generally required to meet the same quality and food safety standards as our own products, and in a case such as this one, in which such standards are required by the legislation, they are not sufficiently controlled. The second thing, which also concerns me, is the way the Commission uses delegated acts to substantially amend legislation, as it has recently attempted to do with the regulation on nutrition and health claims with regard to the ‘no added sugar’ claim. This is similar to what it is trying to do at the moment, although it is not the same case, with the Timber Regulation. This is the reason for Parliament’s position on delegated acts. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner. Mrs Sommer, the shadow rapporteurs, the Hungarian Presidency and the Commission have come to a good agreement with regard to this Regulation which is so important for consumers and the food industry. Many congratulations to all of them. As consumers, of course, we want comprehensive information about everything we eat. However, to put this information on the packaging is no mean feat and we must find a balance in everything. We must also find a cost-benefit balance as we cannot overlook the fact that the information on the labelling, depending on the nature of that information, makes the product more expensive. Someone has to pay that cost. If the consumer does not pay it then many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will have to quit the market as they cannot compete with large companies that can pay this additional cost. I believe that this balance has been achieved and we have to be satisfied. We have to be satisfied with regard to country of origin labelling, for example. It was already foreseen that, where confusion may arise, the origin of products should be labelled. Furthermore, it is permitted that this labelling may be done voluntarily. With regard to processed products containing several ingredients, it is not easy to determine what the main ingredient is. Therefore, another solution other than that adopted would raise implementation problems because of the economic cost and administrative complexity for the companies, without bringing the consumer any clear additional benefit. Also in this context, I agree that this legislation should not be applied to alcohol products as all these products already have comprehensive legislation concerning labelling, and everyone knows that when you drink an alcohol product you are consuming alcohol and that it has calories. In short, all of this is important but, above all, it is very important to educate consumers so that they are able to absorb all this information. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

Mr President, first of all, I wish to express my condolences to the relatives of those who have died as the result of this crisis. Commissioner, informing the public of health risks is a difficult and delicate task and has to be perfectly documented and verified. It is not a question of finding who is to blame, but on this occasion, major errors have occurred, starting with the foolhardy and reckless assumptions of a regional policy manager, recently recruited to the job, who unleashed social alarm and a very serious, irreparable economic crisis. Nor would it appear that the Commission has coordinated this crisis very well. I wonder when the first case occurred, and whether Article 3 of the regulation relating to the rapid alert system – which requires Member States to notify the risk immediately and within 48 hours – was met, and also whether Article 8 of said regulation – which obliges the Commission to check whether the information is complete, true and legible and has sufficient legal basis – was met. What is certain is that the serious shortcomings of this regulation have been exposed and that it is necessary to review the current legal framework in order to define precisely, among other things, the crisis management procedures used by the competent authorities, to attribute errors or omissions to the perpetrator in the food chain (and traceability is used to this end), to prevent health protection from concealing commercial barriers and to arbitrate compensation procedures for damage to trade and loss of profit. Commissioner, neither cucumbers or soya are the cause. As Mr Liese has said, the cause is the pathogen. The cause is serotype O104:H4 of the bacterium Escherichia coli
, which is already described throughout scientific literature and is associated with meat products. However, in any case, Commissioner, we have to allow the scientists to do their work: they need to investigate the entire traceability system, throughout the food chain, including the handling and distribution of food. Pilar Ayuso,

Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Liotard, the Hungarian Presidency and Commissioner Dalli and his team for their efforts. Unfortunately, however, this regulation, which is so important and so necessary, has not reached a satisfactory conclusion because of a labelling requirement that went beyond what was possible in practice. This is a subject that inspires passion and attracts media attention, factors that run counter to logic and pragmatism. I have to say that we have missed the chance to take a step forward, have condemned the agri-food industry to living with obsolete legislation and have put the brakes on European technological advancement, of which we are so supportive in theory. We cannot demand something that involves a level of cost and bureaucracy that cannot be assumed by the food-producing sector, nor can we demand something that we are not capable of imposing upon third parties. We cannot legislate on something that later we will not be able to implement because we would be deceiving consumers. I repeat, it is a pity that we have not reached agreement because this regulation dealt not only with cloning and with how many generations and which products must be labelled, but also with many other points on which agreement has
 been reached, such as nanotechnology and foodstuffs coming from third countries, which were very important for consumers and for the agri-food industry, not only from the point of view of the internal market, but also from a health perspective and in terms of innovation. Since cloning is too complex a matter to relegate to a few paragraphs in another proposal, I urge the Commission once again to prepare a report and present a separate legislative proposal that regulates every aspect of cloning, based on food security and all scientific data. Given that Commissioner Dalli has committed himself on numerous occasions before this House to presenting this proposal, I trust that the Commission will send it to us as soon as possible.

Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, who has worked very hard and, most importantly, achieved an optimum result. It was not at all easy to reach an agreement at first reading on a regulation as complex as this one. The motor industry is of vital importance in the European Union. It is, moreover, an industry that is committed to the European Union’s objective of reducing emissions and to technological innovation. This agreement is a stable framework that gives legal certainty to our vehicle manufacturers. I believe that the targets for reducing emissions are both ambitious and realistic. Manufacturers will have to achieve 147 grams of CO2
 per kilometre by 2020. I am sure that they are going to succeed, and they will therefore have contributed to the European Union’s objective of reducing emissions by 20% by that year. However, there are also other elements of interest in this new regulation, such as super-credits and promoting alternative fuels. Biofuels are clearly promoted, in line with the EU’s objectives regarding renewable fuels for 2020. I am highlighting this obvious fact because if the Commission continues with its hesitant proposals on biofuels, we will not achieve our objective for 2020. Finally, I would like to end my speech by congratulating the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), who has just become a mother and has worked very hard and also helped to make this agreement a success.

 Madam President, our goals must be ambitious, but it must also be acknowledged that the rapporteur’s proposal is not easy to apply with the situation that exists in each Member State. However, we in the Spanish delegation will support his proposal at first reading. Nevertheless, we are in favour the cost of recycling and treatment being invoiced separately. We are going to vote against Amendment 52, which aims to delete Article 14(1), and in favour of Amendments 91 and 103. We believe that consumers have a right to know what this treatment costs and, moreover, that they should know: that motivates them to collaborate with the legislation itself and it is also positive in order for there to be a suitable amount of transparency in the commercial chain.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to highlight the work that has been done by the rapporteur, Mrs McAvan, not only on the content of the report, but also in terms of her methods, because she has worked alongside all the shadow rapporteurs. I would also like to thank the experts from the Spanish Government for their contribution to this agreement. The purpose of this system of pharmacovigilance in the European Union is to strengthen vigilance, transparency and communication in relation to the safety of drugs once they have been put on the market, especially with regard to their risk profiles and the adverse reactions that they can cause. It is important to highlight the creation of the European Pharmacovigilance Committee, which will evaluate and issue recommendations to the European Medicines Agency on the safety issues that can arise in connection with medicines sold in the European Union. The solution that has been reached for both Member States and those responsible for marketing medicines to notify the EudraVigilance database of suspected adverse reactions is very important. EudraVigilance will be the only source of information, but the competent authority in the Member State where it is suspected that an adverse reaction has occurred will be informed at the same time, which is very important. It is also important to highlight the possibility that is being opened up of consumers being able to communicate any adverse reactions, and in this respect, the creation and management by the agency of a European medicines safety web-portal which, in turn, is linked to the portals in each of the Member States, is going to help to improve the public’s knowledge regarding the safety of the medicines that they take. Finally, we cannot forget that given that pharmacovigilance plays a fundamental role in protecting public health, the adoption of this directive and this regulation is going to make a significant contribution to that protection by improving not only the current procedures but also the coordination of actions between the different Member States.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his explanation about the cloning of animals for use as food. Both Parliament and Commission agree that the Novel Food Regulation was indeed not the appropriate framework to deal with this issue. We agree on this, which explains why the issue has been withdrawn from the scope of application of the regulation. We are also all aware, at least according to all the scientific committees, that cloned animal meat, and that of its offspring, satisfy all food safety requirements. It is only here that I see a problem. Namely, that it is impossible to distinguish whether or not meat comes from a cloned animal, or the offspring of a cloned animal, or from an animal that has not been cloned. Therefore, there is a need – an essential need – to use labelling and traceability in order for the consumer to be informed. Consumers want, and have the right, to know if the meat they are eating comes from a cloned animal or not, regardless of knowing whether or not it is healthy, because they may refuse to eat it owing to the issues you have explained, such as animal welfare, or for ethical reasons. It seems, therefore, given this situation, that the production and consumption of cloned animals in Europe is probably going to be banned, particularly its production. Thus, we are going to ban our producers from using a new technique, one that is good for animal reproduction and which, moreover, can make a profit, because obviously, an animal is cloned as a result of having very special characteristics, something which has been done in Spain with fighting bulls, where, as you know, two fighting bulls have been cloned. And we are going to ban it! Are we going to deny them the possibility of using this technique? Because, if that is the case, then our farmers, our livestock breeders, are going to lose competitiveness. This would be fine if, in Europe, we could ban the entry of meat from cloned animals, and their offspring, from other countries. However, are we going ban it? We cannot do so. The World Trade Organisation is not going to accept our ban. Therefore, we are going to have an absurd situation whereby our livestock breeders are not going to be able to use a new technique that will enable them to become more competitive, yet, we are going to be eating such food in the European Union, with or without a label. This is what worries me, and I feel a solution needs to be found. Why are we going to ban it? Why are we going to prevent our livestock breeders from using this technique, only to later bring this food in from outside because we cannot ban its importation? Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, as you have said, this regulation is very important, not only for consumers, but also for the food industry. It deals with novel foods and new processes for manufacturing foodstuffs. As has been said here, the most controversial issue has been that of meat originating from cloned animals and their offspring, as what generally enters the food chain is the offspring, not the cloned animal. I believe that it was a sensible move on the part of Parliament to remove the issue of meat from cloned animals from this proposal, as it is not really possible to dedicate just a few paragraphs to such a novel and new technique as the cloning of animals, even though it is normal in some countries. There is an amendment relating to this within which the Commission, as you have promised, is asked to present a report and a legislative proposal. We are having a bit of a debate here, including within my own group, as to whether we should ask the Commission to present a proposal banning meat from cloned animals, or simply ask the Commission to present a proposal. My opinion is that the Commission should present the proposal, and we should not tell it how to present it. The Commission should present the proposal, and then we will debate it in Parliament, say whether we like it or do not like it, and amend it. This is my position, although we are divided within my group, and tomorrow we will vote on a divided basis. There is another issue, which interests me a great deal, and which you have mentioned, which is the issue of nanomaterials. I agree that a new definition is needed, but we should not limit ourselves to definition and labelling. Any authorisation of nanomaterials must be preceded by exhaustive scientific tests, as these are new materials that are to be incorporated into food, and the question of food safety needs to be a priority. I hope and trust that this will be the case. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE
)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this regulation is of crucial importance for consumers and the agri-food industry, because it is not at all easy to achieve balanced labelling that includes all the essential information but not so much as to complicate it. This is an excellent report and the rapporteur must be congratulated on it. I agree with her on the main subjects regarding nutritional information and the controversial issue of profiles, especially if we bear in mind that the Commission failed to meet its commitment to establish these profiles – as well as the conditions for their use – before 19 January, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. An issue that concerns me is the possibility that national labelling standards will be in existence at the same time: this runs counter to the purpose of the legislation, which is harmonisation and the removal of as many obstacles as possible to the working of a true single market. As regards the indication of country of origin, under the current legislation, this information must be given when failure to do so could mislead the consumer. There is also provision for there always being voluntary labelling. Going further may involve a financial cost and administrative cost for companies, without bringing the consumer any significant and clear benefit. On the use of different languages, I have to say that the Commission’s proposal matches up with the existing directive, which has worked well and not caused problems. Reopening this debate could be dangerous and unnecessary, and could cause problems with the movement of products. Pilar Ayuso,

 Mr President, thrombin is an additive that can be used to stick meat because the fact is that there are no technological or food safety problems related to its use. Indeed, it is already used in some countries. The proposed amendment to the annex states that meat processed with thrombin can be sold pre-packed and labelled; thus, the consumer will not be deceived, which is the basic principle of the resolution. Whatever the case, I would like to ask the Commissioner if the European Commission can commit to products that contain thrombin not being able to be considered as imitations as a result of a suitable label, especially within the framework of the present study of the proposed Regulation on the food information provided to the consumer.

Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Jiménez García-Herrera, I would first of all like to highlight the work done by the rapporteurs – Mr Mikolášik and Mr Perello – and all the work that they have done to reach the best possible compromise for a transplant policy in the European Union. I would also like to highlight the contribution made by the Spanish Presidency and by Dr Matesanz, the Director of the Spanish National Transplant Organisation, because Spain is currently the world leader in terms of donations, with 34.4 for every million inhabitants. This is solely due to the constant improvement in organisation and to the measures that have been taken to raise awareness among the population about organ donation. We need to achieve this for the whole of the European Union: increase the number of donations, ensure that all transplants are done to the same quality standards, and also promote cooperation between all the Member States. We also need to ensure that every donation is voluntary and not rewarded, with the exceptions listed by Commissioner Dalli, in order to combat organ trafficking, which is entirely linked to a scarcity of organs. The action plan can contribute to this by helping to solve the shortage of organs and improving public access to transplants. The solution that has been reached for living donors is very important, as we cannot forget that living donations are complementary and have been shown to be effective even if there is no genetic relationship between the donor and the recipient. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, I want to begin by congratulating the Commissioner, because she works tirelessly in this area – I can vouch for that – especially given that this topic that we are discussing is really very complicated. I would also add the following. There is one area, Commissioner, in which we have demonstrated that we definitely can reduce emissions –indeed, we are seeing its positive impact on growth, competitiveness and, therefore, job creation – and in which Europe is a leader in the technological sphere and is carrying out many actions with specific objectives: that area is energy efficiency. I have said it before and I will say it again now. I believe that Doha, like the last COP in Durban, is a great opportunity for Europe, and the European Union, to head up the development of a road map for energy efficiency, with different types of goals, with common actions, with deadlines, etc. This really needs a precise structure and framework, and the European Union, more than anyone, has an undeniable opportunity to pioneer a road map for energy efficiency.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, what we are debating today are two reports: one by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and another by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The aim of these reports is, among other things, to convey to the Commission Parliament’s views on shale gas so that at a later date, as the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Potočnik, has said, the Commission can present a report on a series of measures relating to this energy source to enable harmonised action within the European Union. I believe that both rapporteurs have put forward the points of view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in a very reasonable manner. Logically their perspectives are not exactly the same. In the case of the two Commissioners, they have set out their vision with a great deal of balance and in a measured way, which is essential for any debate such as this to take place. Someone said before I took the floor that one cannot debate using emotions and when emotions are running high. I ask you who can name or talk about a single energy source that does not carry risks and opportunities for developing the benefits that it brings. The same applies to this one. If humanity had rejected every advance, every encounter, every discovery of the possibility of developing an energy source solely due to the risks that it carried, we would have made no progress at all. We have to insist much more that the technology is as good as possible, that there is investment into research and that this new source of energy can be developed, with all the guarantees in place, in a measured way and without emotion. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, Commissioner, please allow me to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Kariņš, and all the shadow rapporteurs, who took the decision to continue moving forward during the negotiation in the trialogues, which was fraught with difficulties, and described so well by Mr Kariņš. I would say that thanks to that effort and determination, we now have a mechanism that, for the first time, allows information and communication to be exchanged between Member States and the Commission regarding intergovernmental agreements in the field of energy that are reached in those Member States. I believe the idea is to have constant knowledge of the supply map or the energy supply networks and it is very positive, therefore, for the improved management of energy supply in the European Union. When it comes to this regulation, if I had to use a simile, I would say we are paving the way to progressing more quickly in developing the internal energy market. If we throw this opportunity away and do not start paving the way, as is the desire of a certain political group in the House, we would simply be missing a golden opportunity. After a time, we would find ourselves in the same situation as today, but much further down the line. I trust, therefore, there will be a lot of parliamentary support for this proposal tomorrow. I thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs once again for their contribution. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, this is undoubtedly one of the most important legislative contributions in the field of energy in this parliamentary term. Ultimately, there will be few other things that will have the same significance as this Energy Efficiency Directive, and this is as a result of tenacity and hard work. It is as a result of the work done by the rapporteur, but also by shadow rapporteurs who have done truly admirable work, and I therefore congratulate them all. This directive basically has three objectives: it will help to make the European Union less of an energy island, it will help to make climate change targets a reality, and it will also help to develop an energy efficiency market that will make it possible to have greater economic growth through the right technologies. I would, however, like to highlight one thing which I think is the major contribution that Parliament is making to this directive, which is flexibility: flexibility in the 1.5% savings target for energy distributors and sellers, or the target of renovating 3% of buildings; and the flexibility that Member States have to apply alternative measures. This is the key, because there is a great deal of diversity within the European Union. Pilar del Castillo Vera,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, allow me to also begin by personally congratulating Ms Niebler for having led so professionally and so successfully, on Parliament’s behalf, the third regulation on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union, now known as ‘Roaming III’. Not only has it been a success – as far as I can see – by substantially lowering the upper limits of what operators can charge consumers for mobile services when they are in another EU Member State, but the proposal for a regulation that we will vote on in this plenary session also includes other measures such as, for example, extending transparency clauses to European consumers travelling to non-Member States. However, above all, the greatest merit of the Roaming III Regulation is – in my view – its desire to become obsolete and create a competitive market for roaming services themselves, where it will no longer be necessary to regulate the situation in each of the different 27 markets every two years, but rather the situation in the single market, which should represent the European Union. This regulation, which we will vote on tomorrow, will not only be limited on this occasion to establishing new maximum tariffs that mobile phone operators must respect when European consumers travel outside the European Union, but, for the first time, we are tackling the situation – in my view, in a much more intelligent way – by establishing a competitive market. If the structural measures proposed in the regulation are successful, we European consumers will have the option of taking out a roaming contract with a different operator to the one providing us with mobile services in our own country, and we will be able to do this simply and keep our phone number. It is an essential contribution to the development of the digital single market. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am just going to go over two points very quickly. The first is possibly the most discussed issue in this report and that which has led to the most disagreement: whether or not to deal with the emissions trading mechanism. It is clear that it is suffering like any other ‘market’, and it is suffering due to the downturn, but I think it would be wrong to intervene in this market. To intervene to try to improve prices, as is done in other sectors, would be a serious error. More growth is needed. What we have to do is give it a boost, so that we can emerge from the crisis and then the emissions market will return to how it was. Secondly, when it comes to the Roadmap, as has been said here, there are a lot of uncertainties. If I had to draw up a map with different roads to take us to the final objective, which would be a low-carbon economy, there is one road, one route that is the main route: that of energy efficiency. In this area, we can indeed say and plan many things. We have reached agreement on the Energy Efficiency Directive, with a huge effort made by all the parliamentary groups. This is the same agreement that my group and I would like to see reflected in today’s vote on the report we are debating. I honestly believe it is worth it. We managed it for energy efficiency, why can we not do the same with this report? Pilar del Castillo Vera,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (ES) 
Madam President, Commissioner, I think that your explanation was a very logical one, full of common sense. The thing is that sometimes such explanations, which are really very sound, compete with reflections that are equally sound. I think that what we do in Parliament at this point serves as a wake-up call to ensure that an instrument that has had a history of success does not disappear because of theoretical solutions which could in principle, theoretically, turn out to be more efficient but which would, in any event, put an end to the development of a tool that has made a very real contribution so that many programmes derive from it and have very important consequences for energy saving. I am not going to mention them all but there is no doubt that actions such as European Local ENergy Assistance (ELENA), Solar Keymark or GreenLight are success stories. All this has always been based upon a fundamental pillar, namely, innovation, even in these especially severe times of crisis in Europe. It is impossible for societies that do not make innovation the driving force of their development to survive in such a competitive, global society and here we have before us a tool that has proved useful precisely for the purpose of developing innovation in the energy sector. Therefore, Commissioner, our modest contribution is to insist that a tool such as this must not be wasted because it has been tried and tested and, accordingly, we have to give extremely careful consideration to the fact that this intelligent energy tool for Europe could disappear. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we are faced with one of the issues that forms the basis for the success of the Internet, namely the competitive nature and neutral character of the network. In this sense, everything that is related to that aspect is extremely important. I would say that the resolution we are proposing and debating this afternoon is, without a doubt, particularly balanced. It is in accordance with the Commission, in the sense that, when information exists that gives us an indication that a change is occurring to the neutral character of the network, then that would be the moment to propose some kind of legislative action, but that, in the meantime, it is necessary to wait to see what is contained in the report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications. I would like to add something else: there are three conditions sine qua non
, which, in my view, are essential for guaranteeing neutrality on the network. Firstly, there needs to be a truly competitive market for service and telecommunications operators. Secondly, the user needs to be able to change supplier quickly and easily. Otherwise, without a doubt, the market will be very weak from a competitive point of view. Third is transparency. Transparency means, however, that users must be properly informed of all the criteria used by network operators, so that they can really know whether or not they are of interest to them or, on the contrary, whether or not it is of interest to them to switch supplier, as was previously commented. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, I would also like to address Mr Barroso, even though he is not here right now, via the Commissioner. I believe that a reasonable work programme has been set, as in previous years. However, what I feel is missing is the sense of urgency, and this worries me. In many countries, of course including Spain, my own Member State, people get up every morning driven by the urgency of the reforms that must be carried out: in the job market, in budgetary stability, public debt, and so on. What we have here is a programme that, to my way of thinking, lacks that sense of urgency. The main thing it lacks is, essentially, the power of the European Union project to help develop growth and employment, which is the internal market, and the digital internal market as a variant of this. We urgently need to address everything that continues to hinder the development of the internal market today – and there is still a lot – in terms of the transposition and development of directives (such as the Services Directive), and many other aspects that prevent us from unifying and integrating the extraordinary legislative fragmentation currently hampering the development of that market. My main message is that you need to regain the sense of urgency, because if you do not, there is not much that the European Union can do. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, I believe the climate change conference in Durban has an advantage over its immediate predecessors: there is no doubt whatsoever that achieving a binding international agreement is impossible. This should enable energy to be channelled into proposals and joint lines of action that will indeed allow us to progress in practice towards the goal of emissions cuts. So this is good news, because we were not in this position in Cancún, much less when the Copenhagen climate summit was held. I believe this is the time for the European Union to become the regional leader in energy efficiency proposals, which really can unite the work of a great number of other countries, from the most developed and the richest, to the least developed and the poorest. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fighting against climate change by boosting energy efficiency brings incredible opportunities in all areas, and I sincerely believe that it is time for the European Union to become the leader in combating climate change through energy efficiency. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, whenever there has previously been any discussion about SMEs, the focus has been on intervention in financial matters, the lack of liquidity and problems in accessing credit, because that is really the main problem. It is the main problem for governments, SMEs, all companies, banks and, to a large extent, I would say it is the main problem, above all, for each and every member of society. However, allow me to focus on one dimension that I feel is strategically fundamental, and that has only been partially touched upon. It is to do with the internal market. Over recent weeks, the European institutions have been insisting on the importance of taking a decisive step forward in developing the internal market as a strategic element or strategic factor in overcoming the crisis. If we look at the relationship between the internal market and SMEs today, we can see that only 23% of these companies engage in cross-border trade, and that only 13% export outside the European Union, and this gives us a clear idea of how far we still have to go in this area. The problem is that it is very difficult to tackle the current legislative fragmentation on basic issues in the internal market. When SMEs compare the costs and profits, it is really very hard for them to finance the fragmentation in the internal market today, and this is something that must be resolved. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

 Mr President, we are discussing a report that the Commission presented when the occasion arose on the strategy for tackling a matter of special importance, namely, the volatility of prices of raw materials and the increase in demand for raw materials on the part of developing countries, especially China. For my group’s part, we wish to express our thanks for the Bütikofer report and to say that to a very large degree we share the views expressed in it because we consider that it develops, brings into focus and adopts a truly satisfactory approach to raw materials and the strategy for their use, access and development. In that sense, we think that the report we are debating adopts a balanced approach to access to raw materials both within and outside the EU, raw materials which are fundamental and critical. We think that adequate emphasis is placed on the importance of using sources of raw materials efficiently, and that a number of very interesting proposals are put forward for improving recycling practices in the EU. In addition, I would like to point out on behalf of my group that in our opinion, bearing in mind that maintaining growth is fundamental, the issue should not be tackled from the point of view of reducing consumption. Economic growth must be maintained and promoted and, accordingly, what we need to consider are policies for efficient use of these raw materials and policies that truly incentivise rational use of the same. Likewise, we believe that the impact on speculation will be positive because, as a result of the transparency measures proposed by the Commission, we will face a more transparent market than the one in which we find ourselves today and, accordingly, one with reduced scope for speculation. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have to be careful how debates develop. When the Commissioner is constantly being interrupted, there is then an avalanche of questions from other Members of the House, and it is very difficult for the debate to remain on the subject that is being examined and in relation to the points the Commissioner has raised, rather than other Members’ wishes. The first thing I want to say is that some Members of this House need to show a little humility and a little common sense, because they make it appear that they are the only ones that have ever thought about nuclear safety and the only ones who are worried about the future of their children and humanity. The 58 reactors in France or those in the United Kingdom or those in many other countries do not mean that the French or others may be more stupid or less intelligent, or that the future of their children does not worry them, or that they have never thought about nuclear safety. Ladies and gentlemen, nuclear safety is something that is being continually worked on in all nuclear plants in relation to every nuclear reactor. There are many top-quality professionals, not people sitting here spouting hot air, but rather people that have been working on these issues day in day out since the beginning. Is a joint review of stress tests now required? I am completely in agreement, and I have to say that some of the people that are now talking about these issues refused to endorse this Parliament’s joint resolution on this subject, which was supported by the majority of the groups in the House. On that basis, a distinction must be made: we are talking about stress tests and not the abolition of nuclear energy. Those will be national debates and they will have to be carried out there. This is why, speaking of stress tests, because some people do not want to talk about it, they only speak or discuss this in one debate or another with an undertone of eliminating nuclear energy, I have to say that Commissioner Oettinger has done an extraordinary job in a very short time. He has already agreed and carried out, in practice, a series of measures and tests that will show us the extent of the situation we are now in. Therefore, Commissioner, congratulations, we cannot have anything other than appreciation for you in how you have acted. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, today, we find ourselves discussing in this House a joint proposal for a resolution on the revision of the Small Business Act, which the Commission submitted in February. The relationship between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the economy can be defined in many ways, but in a sense, they are the axis around which any economic system revolves, in this case, the European economies. If they are strong, the economy will do well; if they are weak, the economy will do badly. SMEs generate jobs, growth and, accordingly, prosperity for society. I shall refer to three factors that seem to me to be fundamental to achieving a strong network of enterprises. First, the adoption of information and communication technology and the development of technologies such as online administration or cloud computing, which save money, reduce costs and effort and, therefore, improve the competitiveness of SMEs. Second, innovation, which is equally fundamental in this sector. Accordingly, up-and-coming enterprises in the small and medium-sized business sector must be strongly incentivised. Third, SMEs must be able to participate fully in the internal market, both in terms of cross-border public tendering and as regards all other features of the internal market, which are capable of providing extraordinary benefits to SMEs in terms of their competitiveness but are currently failing to do so. Finally, after all this comes the value of entrepreneurship, a social value which must be strong since, if it is not, the whole network will be weak. In this area, both governments and the European Union have much to do, principally through education. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, our colleague, Mr Hökmark, because his work is excellent and, in addition to being excellent, it has great vision for the future, which I think makes it particularly valuable. However, please also allow me to thank, as he did, all the shadow rapporteurs. The result of all this work was the unanimous backing that this report received in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Of course, the report before us is guided by an objective, which is none other than a way of making the European economy more competitive in a global world. That is the key objective of this report and I therefore believe that it is extraordinarily appropriate. I am not going to go into the details, but I would like to focus on two or three aspects that I consider key. First of all, we are in a situation – and this report points this out – in which wireless broadband through the 800 MHz allocation for mobile communications across Europe will be a reality. However the report goes much further: it is thinking more about the future. We are talking about the 700 MHz frequency band, which also has an extraordinary capacity for mobile telephony and its development. I believe that is why we also have to view and evaluate the proposals made in the report very positively. It is not a trivial issue: the spectrum relating to economic activities currently represents 3% of European gross domestic product (GDP) and that is just the start. I should like to mention the importance of video’s exponential growth as an element of communication between different people, and between different institutions and companies. Right now, video represents 40% of world traffic and that is only the start: by 2014, it will represent 91% of end-user traffic. As such, the report positions itself realistically in a vision of an extraordinary future, so I believe that we should give it our full support the day after tomorrow. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need energy to eat, travel, study, cure diseases, and for many other things. That energy has always come from a variety of sources. In some cases, from the oldest sources, such as hydropower, fossil energy, and even nuclear energy; in other cases, from the most modern, for example, renewables. In addition to this, technologies are being developed to bring about increased safety, in some cases, or to offer greater efficiency, as in the case of renewable energies. There is also research that has not yet been applied, such as carbon storage, or that which is expected to – and will – lead us to fusion power. All of this is necessary, ladies and gentlemen, because human life has operated and developed on the basis of constant improvements to the resources used and the research that made this possible. Communication, energy, medicine and study are based on that: the continual improvement of all our resources. Recently, the tsunami and the earthquake that caused it resulted in serious damage for the people of Japan, including victims, missing people and material losses, as well as significant damage to the Fukushima plant. With all that in mind, what we have to do is improve safety. Tomorrow, this House will vote on a joint resolution, on which the vast majority of the parliamentary groups have agreed. It expresses what unites us, not what divides us. I would ask the groups to remain loyal to the content of the proposal and not to allow their own interests to get in the way of the common interest or of the shared view that we have achieved on this proposal. That is our responsibility for tomorrow. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would also like to start by thanking Mr Lange for his efforts in bringing together so many differing opinions and visions, a situation that is quite common in Parliament. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various political groups. In fact, this report tries to answer a question that has already been under consideration for a long time: do European industries have any future in a global world? I think the answer is yes. Yes, because European Union countries are proving that they do. Yes, because there are also specific European industrial sectors that are proving that they do. All of this has to do with a number of aspects: some are related to the job market, because we need a flexible job market, not a rigid one; others are related to productivity, financial policies and tax incentives. However, allow me to highlight three that are now closely linked to the European Union itself. Firstly, the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. These are two key issues. Enterprise and innovation are key elements of the future of any industry in Europe. Particular attention should be paid to young entrepreneurs. Secondly, strengthening the internal market and making sure it is competitive and, internally, based on free competition. Therefore, the subsidies still being given to transport, energy, and publicly owned businesses should be reduced so as to ensure free competition within the European internal market. Thirdly, respecting the conditions of competition within the international framework: when it comes to environmental policies and product sourcing, it is vital to compete on equal terms. We do not want protectionism within the European Union, nor do we want protectionism when our industry competes with third countries and third regions. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission and the parliamentary delegation, led by our fellow Member Mr Leinen, on the work that they did in Cancún, a meeting that I was unfortunately unable to attend in the end. I believe that Cancún and its results can be viewed, along the lines of what my colleague, Mr Seeber, was saying, from the perspective of Copenhagen: Cancún viewed from the Copenhagen perspective. The first conclusion from this perspective is that there was a fundamental differentiating factor. In Copenhagen, the expectations were very high, and in Cancún the expectations were much more realistic, as a result of which the assessment of Copenhagen was very negative, while the assessment of Cancún, both by those who took part and by the media in general, was very positive. Cancún learned lessons from Copenhagen, and I think that is the first, very interesting, conclusion. I believe that measures have been taken and agreements reached which are not, of course, ground-breaking, but which could be very interesting from the point of view of efficiency. Among other things, I think that the creation of a committee and a technology network to promote technological cooperation is extremely important. Here, we are going to adopt a report during this sitting on energy efficiency, which is one of the fundamental keys to effectively combating climate change. Also, I think that matters such as the World Bank being more involved or official recognition of the actions of countries to reduce emissions returning to the procedure and framework of the United Nations are very positive. Finally, I would like to say that there is one year to go before we get to South Africa. It would be a very good idea if, in the same way that Cancún learnt from Copenhagen, we now learnt from Kyoto, and achieved an international frame of reference for an agreement against climate change that is more flexible, more transparent, more efficient and more integrative.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job. Her report is, of course, as ambitious as it is extensive, and I must say that it is the result of the tough and successful negotiations that resulted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopting it practically unanimously. Continuing with this subject, I would like to point out something of which we are all aware, but which there is no harm in saying: the energy situation in Europe is not exactly an optimum one. Not only are we increasingly dependent on energy imports obtained from outside Europe, but we are also having to deal with the huge investments needed in our energy infrastructures at a time when Europe is still suffering the consequences of the crisis. This is all in the context of not yet having managed to apply our own energy legislation. Now in this parliamentary term we have an instrument that was not available in the previous one. The Treaty of Lisbon not only provides a series of clear objectives such as the internal energy market, security of supply, energy efficiency and promoting energy networks, but it also gives the European Union a legal framework and a sound legal basis – Article 194 – for acting in the field of energy policy. In this new context in which we are having this debate, I ask all my fellow Members to support this report, which proposes a series of measures aimed at guaranteeing energy supply and full implementation of the existing legislation and programmes. It also stresses the need to invest in research, promotes the development of pan-European energy grids and gives the creation of the internal energy market the priority it deserves. Thank you very much, and I ask you all to support this report tomorrow. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, I would like to start by saying that I felt that both speeches by the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner gave a very different perspective on the Cancún conference to their perspective on the Copenhagen conference. It is a more realistic, much more viable perspective, and there is therefore much more potential for it to be effective. If Copenhagen was the all-or-nothing summit – as the President-in-Office of the Council said – Cancún must be the summit that provides a variety of viable and efficient options. The battle against climate change has two fundamental features: firstly it has to be global, involving all the major polluters, from the United States to Brazil, China and India. Secondly, it has to be a series of measures that are effective in their impact on climate change, we need to be able to measure that impact, and they must not be detrimental to economic growth. In this respect we also need to have the humility to recognise that the global challenge of tackling climate change offers a variety of technological and political options. There are and may be binding agreements, there are sectoral agreements, there is technology transfer and there is support for research. All the options need to be brought into play, along with a radical increase in energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy and of society. This is the only way that we will be able to effectively tackle the problems of climate change. In this respect, if Cancún is the summit that produces a variety of viable and efficient agreements, it will have been a great success. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, in this time of crisis, in which we find ourselves, there are two main types of policies and actions: preventive policies and actions and stimulative policies and actions. Preventive policies are those that currently concern the supervision of financial services, governance and strengthening governance. In other words, anything that is going to alert us to the fact that there are problems before the problems overwhelm the European economies. However, the second type of policies – stimulative policies – are essential. There are three fundamental aspects of these policies, Mr Barroso, Mr Wathelet. Naturally, there are more, but I am going to highlight three: research and innovation, the development of a digital society – in other words, the digital agenda – and the internal market. The first, research and innovation, is where I find the work programme presented by the Commission to be lacking. President Barroso said earlier that the specific programmes will come in mid-2011, but I do not think that is enough. I can assure you that I and my group would very much have liked to see a reference to the Eighth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, which does not feature in your proposal. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioners, Mr Magnette, there can be no doubt that the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico has raised awareness of these types of situations, while exposing the need to analyse them in depth and to take measures to prevent or counteract them. These things also occur in Europe. They have occurred. I am a national of a country, Spain, where not many years ago, we had a problem – in the north of the country – with spillages of this type due to problems with transportation, in this case, a problem with tankers. When we find ourselves faced with a situation of this type, the risk is to act emotively and without thinking all that much, and therefore without any balance in decision making, which may have undesirable consequences. I believe that what the Commissioners explained to us, the ten points that Commissioner Oettinger set out, is a very important and interesting approximation of the problem, and that it is along the right lines. There is a need to act forcefully with regard to civil responsibility and partnership, arrive at joint positions with the International Maritime Organisation, harmonise the legislation of Member States better, etc., but this needs to be done in such a way that the actions we take do not have any undesirable consequences. What needs to be done therefore needs to be assessed very well, including economically, together with its impact. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, many fellow Members have wondered why the Lisbon Agenda failed and whether we should start by analysing that failure in order to take the next steps. In my view, the problem with the Lisbon Agenda was that it was ultimately nothing more than a symbol enclosed in a bubble, which was not implemented at all in practice. In the end we found that on the one hand there was a theory, the Lisbon Agenda, about which we were all talking, and on the other hand there was the practice, which had nothing to do with it. Therefore, in my view, based on this experience the Europe 2020 strategy must be a new agenda that can only be taken forward if there is a resounding commitment – I would stress, a resounding commitment – from all the institutions: the European political institutions and the national political institutions. This commitment also needs to be one that can be verified and evaluated; it needs to be one that we have information about and an immediate capacity to correct if the commitments are not being fulfilled when there are failures. This is so that we do not find ourselves in any situation of extreme circumstances. Either we all understand that this joint project needs these instruments in order to move forward, or we will soon be in a similar situation. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, this is a debate on an issue on which there is generally a great deal of agreement, so it is not one of those debates in which there are radically different positions, but rather the positions are different in simple terms. We heard this in the speech by Mr López Garrido, and in the speech by the Commissioner, and it is reflected in the resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow in Parliament with the support of all the political groups. Having said this, there are a series of problems to resolve before electric cars can be fully efficient, and the task that we now have in front of us is to focus on seeing how we can resolve these problems as soon as possible so that electric cars can also become part of the whole project of having more sustainable and efficient energy consumption. In this respect I would like to highlight one of the issues that has been mentioned, which is also in the resolution, which is the issue of research. There are still a series of fundamental problems linked to the efficiency of the batteries and recharging, as well as the problems of standardisation, interoperability, and so on, which have a long way to go. In order for this ground to be covered as soon as possible, I think that it is essential, as in so many other aspects linked to energy and other issues, that efforts are focused on research. This does require an enormous effort from a financial point of view, both from the European institutions and from the national institutions. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Madam President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso – who is not here, but whom I am also addressing – the truth is that it has been very good to see you together and, in my opinion, this is because we have seen that there is a move towards and a focus on what should be the foundations of the common strategy in the next ten years and, in my view, this is extremely important. What most interested me about the proposal that we have seen in writing and what you have said is that there only need to be a few objectives: only the top-priority objectives; that they need to be tangible, that we need to be able to measure them and they need to be constantly evaluated in order to see whether or not we are making progress in that direction. I think this is fundamental, and it is a substantial change from the Lisbon Strategy. I am going to highlight one objective: the internal market. The European internal market was conceived more than 20 years ago. Twenty years later, there is a long way to go before we have a truly internal European market in the majority of sectors. In some cases, this is because they are very new sectors, such as the digital market, but in other cases, there is such a degree of fragmentation and such barriers that we are depriving the European economy of the large-scale framework that it needs in order to be able to really develop all the competitiveness that it needs, which will bring about growth, which, in turn, will bring about employment. Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, we need a great deal of political impetus: ‘business as usual’ can no longer be a tool. We need a great deal of leadership, and you have a big responsibility. You do, of course, have my full support for making this possible. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, I would firstly like to recognise the effort made, and also the enthusiasm shown by both the Commission and the Council and, of course, Parliament over such a long period throughout this programme to combat climate change. I would like to say that there are a series of certainties that should map out our route for us. The first one is this: we need everyone to take part, especially all the countries that are major polluters. The second near-certainty is this: based on all the information we have, it appears that it will be very difficult for a legally binding agreement to be reached in Copenhagen, in the same way as the agreements on the percentage of emissions are, of course, binding. This reality should not, however, cause us to give up, because pessimism results from failing to acknowledge reality. On the contrary, optimism is based on acknowledging reality. What should we do in Copenhagen, essentially? Of course, we should not forget the possibility of reaching that general agreement. As we are aware of the situation and the possibilities that exist, however, I think we should concentrate on sectoral agreements that are really valid, with viable objectives. I have in mind an agreement on deforestation, an agreement on aid for emerging countries and developing countries, but most importantly, an agreement on technology transfer. I also think it would be an extremely good idea to have agreements to promote programmes so that the industrial sectors that consume the most energy worldwide can reach agreements on emissions, whichever country they are in. This would also make our economies more competitive. To conclude, I would like to stress that optimism is based on realism and effectiveness is based on setting viable objectives. This should be our guide at all times. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks to my fellow Members, and in this case, mainly to the rapporteur, Mrs Trautmann, because she has really done an extraordinary job. You had to be there to know how much was achieved in this final stage, which resulted in success in the conciliation process. I would say that at the moment, we are in an excellent position to begin to tackle a future that is, in a sense, revolutionary, or should be revolutionary. We finally have – or we are soon going to have – a regulatory framework that lays some very good foundations for putting the development of the internet, the digital society and the digital economy at the forefront of our objectives. This framework provides good protection for consumers, promotes their rights and also provides security for investors. I think, however, that it is very important for us to now look decisively towards the future. We must look decisively beyond 2010 so that we can devote all our efforts to setting a digital agenda beyond 2010. The key objectives of this digital agenda should include: enabling everyone, as consumers and citizens, to have all the resources needed to access and participate through the internet and, of course, developing an internal digital market that is open and competitive. This is an absolutely essential objective if we want to put the European economy where it should be in the global world of today. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission. With regard to the subject that we are debating, there are some certainties and a set of uncertainties. The first certainty, or the first common element, is that there is now a major convergence of opinion that emissions need to be reduced and that clean energy sources need to be developed. The second certainty is that there needs to be a global approach to or way of dealing with the problem. Therefore, the countries that emit the most CO2
 into the atmosphere need to take part in all international agreements. The major producers of CO2
 include the United States, China, India and Brazil. The third certainty is that the European Union is putting a proposal on the table that is an obligatory system of targets: 20% or 30%. The fourth certainty is that there are no reasonable signs, for various reasons, that the major CO2
 emitting countries are going to accept an agreement of this nature, and that is the reality. There is not such a lack of optimism if we acknowledge the reality; pessimism wins the day if we do not know the reality. It is only by acknowledging the reality that we can create an effective policy, and it will be a more optimistic policy. I think that the European Union, as it takes the lead on this issue, has a duty to put additional measures and additional proposals on the table. Japan has been mentioned here, and we have to talk about the success of projects such as the Sector Focus project, which affect the most polluting industries. On the basis of a process of benchmarking, such projects have achieved extraordinary objectives in Japan. These are the realistic ways of tackling climate change. Copenhagen is an opportunity, but it will only be an opportunity for efficiency rather than rhetoric if we base it on reality. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being very clear in your explanation of the current situation in relation to Nabucco and its potential and viability – seemingly in the short term, according to what you said – and also for the information on the Desertec project. There can be no doubt that the Sun is an extraordinary source of energy. Converting this energy into energy that can be used by people is an area which has seen major developments in the last 20 years. However, there is also no doubt that we still have a way to go before the full potential and viability of this source can be technologically assured, particularly in projects such as the Desertec project which we are now discussing. This project is very welcome and we must therefore support it and keep moving forward in order to solve the technological problems. However, I must really draw your attention to the fact that, when talking about energy efficiency, and particularly about security of supply and therefore diversification of energy sources, one particular energy source is ignored to a certain extent. I am of course talking about nuclear energy. This energy source is systematically being discriminated against, because it does not fit with what is happening in many EU countries or with global trends or with mankind’s current energy needs. This situation must be turned on its head. We must adopt an attitude of considering all possible energy sources in terms of the role that they can play. Here in this Parliament we cannot so obviously turn our backs on this reality. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to use this minute to mention the tragic consequences of the heavy rains which have fallen in southern and south-eastern Spain, particularly in the region of Valencia, Murcia and part of Andalusia. There was torrential rainfall on 28 September 2012 which caused very considerable damage across the whole agricultural sector. Thousands of hectares of crops were flattened, and many farms were completely ruined. The livestock sector also suffered losses, and damage was caused to the municipal road network, to street lighting, homes, buildings, and to industrial and commercial premises. I would also like to stress the difficulties which were already being experienced in Lorca, a town which, as you know, suffered a powerful earthquake a year ago, along with Puerto Lumbreras. Those two towns, those two Spanish municipalities in the region of Murcia, and all those in these and other regions, are seeking the solidarity of the European Union in order to be able to carry on.

 Madam President, the coastal regions, seas and oceans are undoubtedly of fundamental importance for the economic growth of the European Union and all its Member States. Following the Commission’s communication, an ‘Action Plan for an integrated maritime policy for the European Union’, known as the ‘Blue Book’, we are now in the current situation where the idea of an integrated maritime policy is welcome, and what it does and aims to do is certainly to make better use of the opportunities the sea provides. They know that this idea will form the basis for specific environmental and maritime transport policies which are so important for all these areas and for energy, research, fishing and regional policies. All of these aspects are, of course, vital for all these regions. I myself, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, fully support the proposal for a regulation and, furthermore, we believe that the EUR 40 million allocated for the current 2011-2013 period is sufficient. I should also like to say that it would be necessary for this funding to continue into the future, after 2014, since we need to consolidate the process that has been initiated and thereby ensure the continuation of such a promising course of action. I should also like to say that there should be a consistent approach to all the seas within the European Union so that we can see the range of projects and gain real first-hand knowledge of what the issues are in each sea basin. Clearly, the problems of the North Sea are not the same as those of the Mediterranean; hence, it would be valuable to adopt a consistent approach in order to discover more about this diversity. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the various opinions that have been drafted to finalise a programme which we see as of great importance for the future of the European Union.

Madam President, 80 million people, 16% of the population of the European Union, suffer from some kind of disability. This is why Mr Kósa’s report is so timely. It is an important report that discusses the European Disability Strategy and analyses it in detail. I would like to highlight three ideas in this report. The first of these is inclusive education, which is necessary so that each student’s individual characteristics can be taken into account, as required by Article 24 of the United Nations Convention. The second idea is the need for the employment market to open up to people with disabilities, so that we can meet the Europe 2020 strategy target of 75% employment. The third idea is that the economic crisis must never be an excuse to discriminate against disabled people. Lastly, other significant ideas in the report include a single European mobility card that would allow all benefits and rights to be mutually recognised in the Member States, and a similarly unified travel card to consolidate our efforts to help this group.

 Mr President, on 29 June this year the Majorcan pilot Antonio Planas, who was 49 years old, lost his life, the victim of a Taliban terrorist attack, along with 20 other people in Kabul. Antonio was married and he was the father of an eight-year-old girl. He worked for a Turkish airline and his death took place outside the EU. I am using this minute to point out that all those Europeans who are the victims of a terrorist attack outside the EU do not qualify for the forms of compensation that they would qualify for if the attack had taken place within a Member State. Imagine the position of Antonio’s daughter and his widow: they are victims of terrorism but they cannot enjoy the same rights as if the attack had taken place in Spain. Therefore, I would like to seek protection for all those Europeans who are the victims of terrorism when the death takes place outside the territory of the EU. In Spain a law is being formulated, the law for the recognition and comprehensive protection of victims of terrorism, which appears to be capable of correcting that grave error and of rehabilitating and protecting all victims of terrorism equally, in favour of memory, dignity, justice and truth, which are doubtless the ideas that underlie the law itself.

 Mr President, cohesion policy has undoubtedly contributed to increased productivity in all regions of the EU and to eliminating regional disparities and there is no doubt that it has proved fundamental for all citizens and that it is helping – and will continue to help – to combat the economic and financial crisis Europe is suffering. This is why the fifth cohesion report is so timely. There are three key ideas. The first is that gross domestic product should be supplemented by other indicators on the part of national and regional authorities. The second idea is that there should be an intermediate category so that all regions that do not come under convergence and do not manage to achieve competitiveness can be treated in a similar way when similar situations arise and so that these regions do not ever suffer a sudden change. The third idea is to reinforce Objective 3. I wish to make two requests. The maximum distance of 150 kilometres should be removed to enable many regions such as, for example, the Balearic Islands to access cross-border cooperation. My second point is that the report says that the working languages of the EU are French, English and German. That is not so. The 23 languages of the EU are what make us rich and diverse.

 Madam President, in January, the European Commission approved the strategy to tackle early school dropout as a key contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy to fight the school dropout problem across the entire European Union and reduce rates by at least 10%. Strangely, this strategy does not make any reference to disabled people, and this is why I would like to use this minute to make an appeal, since the education ministers of all the Member States will be meeting in Brussels on 2 and 4 May to discuss the global strategies around this issue. I would like to ask that the issue of disabled people be included within this strategy, because it is of fundamental importance for this group of people all over Europe to receive continuous education and therefore to be able to access the labour market. Article 24 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that disabled people are not, under any circumstances, to be excluded from the general education system.

Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the working group led by the chair of the Committee on Regional Development, which has made it possible for us to have this debate today. We certainly all agree that cohesion policy is the essential element for achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and also for achieving European integration and achieving the economic, social and territorial cohesion set out in the Treaty of Lisbon that people are clamouring for so much. What we need to start doing now, in my view, is to see what mistakes we have made and improve what we have done so far. We all agree that the process needs to be much more flexible, there need to be fewer bureaucratic obstacles, and the controls need to be simpler. Also, the regions with specific difficulties, such as islands, mountainous areas, cross-border regions and outermost regions, must receive specific treatment. Gross domestic product must continue to be the main criterion, although there might be other indicators in other decision-making processes, and the regions and local bodies must play a fundamental role. It seems that we all agree on this. So we are going to go down this road, but the Commission should clarify for us whether this is indeed the road we should go down or whether it should be another one. It needs to clarify whether we are going to have the same budgets, which is absolutely essential in order for no one to lose out and for all the regions to be able to make progress in terms of innovation, competitiveness, development, income and progress, especially in a time of crisis when clarity is needed more than ever.

Mr President, I would first of all like to thank all those who signed this motion for a resolution, which is welcomed extremely warmly by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and in Spain, the country that we represent. We have the legal framework, which is Article 174(3) of the Treaty of Lisbon. We also have territorial cohesion, which is the new pillar that is set out in that treaty, and therefore we have the legal basis to step out and help these regions: mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas. In the case of mountain regions – as has been said here – we are talking about 90 million inhabitants; in the case of islands, there are 21 million people living on islands in 14 countries, and many millions more live in mountain regions. All of these areas share a very similar set of problems in terms of culture, education, transport and the environment. Specifically, there is one disadvantage that unites us all, which is in terms of transport. I come from the Balearic Islands, where the additional cost of transport has been calculated at 20%. This undoubtedly has repercussions on our industry, agriculture, strategic sectors, tourism and, in short, on the whole business sector: the entire economic fabric. It therefore affects our competitiveness. Therefore, if we then focus on resources, such as drinking water or land, which is limited, or raw materials such as energy or the living spaces in those areas, we will see that they undoubtedly result in a phenomenon of shortages and of a lack of economic diversification. We are therefore calling for the new financial perspectives to take into account the specific characteristics of these areas and for us to move from words to action – as has also been said here – which should be translated into budgets, and hence into greater territorial cohesion. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

Madam President, Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives the European Union responsibility for economic, social and territorial cohesion, and for solidarity between the Member States. That cohesion and, in particular, territorial cohesion, is therefore one of the Union’s main objectives in order to ensure harmonious development and remove regional disparities. The Treaty of Lisbon also mentions supporting the island regions. I am speaking because the Spanish Government has announced a cut in the subsidy for discounting flights to the Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla for residents. In other words, it intends to cut into discounts for residents. Residents of these regions see air travel as essential. It is not optional, but rather they depend on it as it is their only means of contact with the outside world, and therefore maintaining discounts will ensure that those regions have equal opportunities and can compete. I ask Parliament to support this territorial cohesion and I trust that it will make the Spanish Government reconsider removing these discounts. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

 Mr President, we approved the Lisbon Agenda with its very ambitious objectives in 2000. Some of these have been met, but a lot of them have not. There is no doubt that the regional funds contributed to the Lisbon Strategy. Ten years on, we find ourselves shaken by the worst economic crisis we can remember. I believe that this crisis has served to enable us to identify, in this new Europe 2020 strategy, where we went wrong, as well as enable us to improve so as to achieve better results. Firstly, we have learned that coordination between all governance levels is essential, as is clearly stated in Mr Cortés Lastra’s report. We have also learned that the contribution of regional funds is essential to meeting the objectives we are proposing. We believe that the combination of specific actions at all levels – European Union, national, regional and local authorities – is an absolute necessity. If we work together, we will be much stronger. It is also important that a Cohesion policy covering economic, social and territorial aspects be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy. I would also like to make an observation as regards the Cohesion policy issue here, namely that the bureaucratic procedures should be much more flexible and efficient. Furthermore, in the disability sector, that difference will have to be taken into account in some way. Finally, I would like to underline the important role to be played by European regions and towns and cities, and especially, the need to pay more attention to those areas with special needs, such as mountain areas, coastal areas and islands. In short, if we want to be successful, we have to be able to count on the European regions, the towns and the cities and on a reformed Cohesion policy in line with the new situation.

 Mr President, the closure of a large part of European airspace over recent weeks following the eruption of the Icelandic volcano has had serious consequences for the entire European economy. This is clearly the case for the passengers, airlines and airports of the aviation sector, but it is also true for the tourism sector. That is what I wanted to talk to you about. In Spain, this is our second-largest industry. In the islands I hail from, it is the main industry. There is huge concern for the effects of the volcanic cloud on the tourist industry. There is talk of losses of EUR 42 million a day. It has dealt a serious blow to the tourism sector, which is still concerned about what the future repercussions may be. Mr Tajani, the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship, has committed himself to study the losses in this sector. My request today would be for an urgent relief package both for these airlines and for the other businesses in the tourism sector, and for the tourism sector to be treated as a priority.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor to highlight and condemn implementation of the Spanish Government’s Law on the Coastline, in particular, its effects on the island of Formentera. Formentera is one of the Balearic Islands. It is 19 kilometres long and has a perimeter of 69 kilometres. The implementation of this law will be positive in areas devastated by urban development. It will not, however, be beneficial for the island of Formentera, because it requires the elimination of most of the island’s tourist facilities, which means small family businesses will be seized. These facilities are the island’s livelihood and have been legally established for between 30 and 40 years. By way of example, I could mention the Hotel Rocabella, which was the first hotel on the island, or the bar and restaurant known as the Blue Bar, which is internationally renowned and has helped to promote the island abroad. Seventy per cent of these facilities would be affected by the implementation of the aforementioned law, despite having been established legally when they were set up. All this law would do would be to permit seizure. We therefore call for a fair demarcation system for the island of Formentera. I call on the Spanish Government to undertake a new demarcation, respecting private property, in line with the many rulings on the subject by the Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. Never again should a law like this one with retroactive effect be drawn up. It is causing a great deal of damage. In particular, it should be borne in mind that all these facilities were built with respect for the environment. Furthermore, the coast is protected under national and local legislation. It is not possible to build within 300 metres of the coast or to increase the amount of hotel accommodation. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate Mr Goerens on his excellent report. The Agenda for Change is an important roadmap for redefining development cooperation and for striving for better quality and effectiveness of aid, particularly in view of current changes in the new world order, the emergence of new international actors and the necessary process of fiscal consolidation into which we are forced by our current economic situation. We are pleased that the Commission is making poverty a core element of its differentiation policy. However, we deplore the fact that gross national income has been adopted as the key indicator for implementation of that policy. Mr President, 70 % of the people in this world whose income is below the poverty threshold live in middle-income countries. If we want to have a real impact on reducing this poverty, we need to take into account, in addition to wealth, other criteria such as the vulnerability of some of those countries, the lack of internal cohesion or the human development indicator. Many of these countries could also be key players today through triangular or South-South cooperation mechanisms, not to mention drivers of development for the future. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

 Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Cortés Lastra on his excellent report. Latin America is one of the regions of the world that has grown the most in recent years. As its largest global donor, the European Union has made a significant contribution to that development, and this is not the time to suddenly cut off our aid, but rather to do so gradually, so that those countries can consolidate their rule of law and continue to reduce their poverty figures. We need to maintain the levels of cooperation aid to Latin America as, despite achieving regional growth figures of more than 4%, it has the largest pockets of poverty in the world and the greatest levels of economic and social inequality. The European Union and Latin America share common values and interests and must move forward together in order to face up to the global challenges facing our societies, which are now more interdependent than ever.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the tragedy of Mali is the chronicle of a death foretold. One year ago, I had the honour of being the chief observer of an EU election observation mission in Niger; the Nigerien authorities – who knew exactly what they were talking about – and the few ambassadors posted there warned the European governments that there would be terrible consequences for all the Sahel countries if the Tuaregs, who formed part of Gaddafi’s army of mercenaries, returned. They said that those armed Tuaregs would unite, in particular, with their supporters in those countries and also with forces of the al-Qaeda organisation in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM); they also warned that AQIM had infiltrated the Libyan rebels. Baroness Ashton, I am very pleased about the measures you announced for all the Sahel countries, but I would just say that those measures need to be taken urgently and quickly because otherwise, we are going to be facing a truly pressing problem. Most of those countries could soon come under the control of the fundamentalist AQIM forces, all of which will be happening on Europe’s doorstep. I should not like to finish without mentioning all those people who have been abducted by AQIM, and I urge you to take all possible measures to bring about their swift liberation.

 Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Ms Vassiliou, my colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education and the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for the fruitful work we have done together over the past few months. Today the sports world is mourning those who died at a football match in Egypt. I would like to express my strong condemnation, and to remember the victims and their families. While drawing up this report I was in constant contact with the sports world, hearing people’s concerns and trying to reflect the issues on which the EU is being asked to express its opinion. The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has caused a revolution in the sports world because, for the first time, it was given its own legal basis, in Article 165. The first response to the Treaty was the Commission communication entitled ‘Developing the European Dimension in Sport’, which follows the guidelines set out in the 2007 White Paper. Parliament responded with an own-initiative report of the same name. The report was approved by the Committee on Culture and Education by 28 votes in favour and 2 votes against. I would like to highlight two concepts related to sport, of which I was very aware when writing the report. Firstly, the principle of subsidiarity, which recognises the competences of Member States and, secondly, the concept of the specific nature of sport, as mentioned in Article 165. However, this is not a universal principle, but rather one that must be analysed and approved on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the autonomy of governance structures in sport should be respected as a fundamental principle for its organisation. Allow me to briefly highlight some points made in the report. First of all, volunteering, when thousands of citizens selflessly take part to ensure that countless sporting events can be held. We must give them our unconditional support. Secondly, doping. Doping substances are a blight on sport and society. We should educate people on prevention, convict traffickers, pursue cheats and harmonise sanctions between sports law and civil law, maintaining the greatest possible respect for sportspeople. The report urges Member States to treat trafficking in illegal substances in the same way as trafficking in illegal drugs and to adopt national legislation to this end. It is vital to support the practice of sport in schools, and we therefore call for sport to be part of their curriculum. At some point, sportspeople’s professional careers come to an end, and during their career they need to have access to high-quality academic training in order to later become integrated into the world of work. Unfortunately, racism, xenophobia and homophobia are present in sport, and it is therefore necessary to implement new measures to eliminate any signs of those threats at sporting events. I would like to stress the undeniable benefit that sport has on people’s health, leading to a significant reduction in public health spending. I would also highlight the importance of sport as a means of integration for the most vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and socially excluded groups, as well as for those with disabilities. Betting should be protected from unauthorised activities, and from suspected match fixing, in particular by recognising organisers’ property rights with regard to their competitions. The report also calls on Member States to take legal action against sports fraud. It is fundamentally important that commercial exploitation of audiovisual rights for sport competitions should be carried out on a centralised, territorial basis with a view to guaranteeing that revenues are distributed fairly between elite and mass-participation sport. I would like to draw attention to the proposal to establish a European Day of Sports and an Erasmus Sports Programme, and to protect indigenous sports as part of our cultural heritage. These are just a few of the issues dealt with in the report, and I hope I can count on Parliament’s support. Santiago Fisas Ayxela,  
rapporteur. – (ES) 
Mr President, I should like to thank all the Members who have spoken in this sitting. I am not going to waste a second refuting some of the lies that have been told today. Whoever is able to read should simply read the report. I would, however, like to finish by stressing the importance of sport for a variety of vital social issues such as the integration of the most vulnerable groups, public health, education, employment and the economy. We should remember that sport in Europe represents, whether directly or indirectly, 15 million jobs – that is, 5.4% of the active population – and an annual added value of EUR 407 billion, which is 3.65% of European GDP. For this reason, because sport is so important, I welcome the Commission’s initiative and support, and I would also venture to ask the Commissioner whether Structural Funds could be applied specifically to sport. Above all, I would like to thank the main political groups in this House for their support. Thanks to the support shown by those groups, I hope that this report will be adopted in tomorrow’s vote.

 Madam President, fortunately the Libyan opposition has successfully confronted Muammar Gaddafi’s dictatorship, with the help of the international community. Now Gaddafi must be caught and judged for the crimes, violations of human rights, and possible crimes against humanity that he may have committed. The most important thing of all at the moment is to focus our efforts on rebuilding the country and endeavour to help Libya become a democratic state based on the rule of law. There are certain vital elements for ensuring the country is secure and viable: establishing the normal functioning of infrastructures, particularly where water, electricity and oil are concerned; maintaining public order by means of a police force; and effectively collecting all the weapons that have been distributed throughout the country. We should also remember the importance of supporting the Sahel countries: on the one hand, to avoid the extremely serious consequences for their security if mercenaries return and pro-Gaddafi forces flee to those countries; on the other hand, to support their institutions, which are enabling displaced persons from Libya to make an orderly return to their homes. Finally, I believe that the deployment of a United Nations mission to the country would be key to achieving the objectives mentioned. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, Lady Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to refer to the case of Libya in particular. Among all the Maghreb countries, the situation of Libya seems to me especially worrying since it is at the gates of Europe and has abundant oil reserves. We have been at war a long time and the situation appears to be stagnating. I believe that the EU should do everything possible to achieve two objectives: that Colonel Gaddafi leaves the country and, also, that Libya enjoys a stable situation and becomes a democratic state, and does not run the risk of degenerating into a failed state which could be infiltrated by al-Qaeda, which would be a very dangerous and worrying situation for Europe. Furthermore, an ungovernable state, the massive return of emigrants to their countries of origin and, above all, of armed Tuaregs, could cause a conflict situation in the neighbouring countries. Libya is an Arab state but, above all, it is an African state, and I think it is very important to take into account the opinion of the neighbouring states of the Sahel in connection with this country’s situation. If we are not capable of getting rid of Gaddafi and bringing this war to an end, maybe these countries have proposals that we should listen to. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

Mr President, as you know, Niger, one of the central countries of the Sahel region, is holding presidential and parliamentary elections at the end of this month. I think that Baroness Ashton’s decision to send a European Union delegation to those elections is an important gesture of support, and I want to thank her for thinking of me to chair it. I would first of all like to express my regret at the recent murder of two young French people in Niger at the hands of terrorists, not forgetting the Nigerien soldiers who died during the rescue operation. The population of the region clearly rejects violence and terrorism, as they are the first to suffer as a result, but they ask the European Union to do everything it can to help them to eradicate terrorist violence and, among other things, to provide weapons and training for their armed forces so that they can respond adequately to these terrorist incursions. In addition, despite having a great wealth of natural resources, Niger is one of the least developed countries in the world. The European Union must therefore work to establish an effective development cooperation strategy to help Niger and the whole region out of the difficult situation they are in. I think there is a great deal at stake for us in this area of the world, because it is not only its welfare, but that of Europe that is dependent on its stability, given its geographical proximity.

Madam President, thousands of Saharans left their cities and peacefully set up the Gdaim Izyk camp in order to demand better living conditions. The Moroccan security forces violently dismantled the camp and, as a result, serious riots broke out in Al Aaiún. The Moroccan armed forces killed a young Saharan, and a Spanish citizen died in unclear circumstances. There are currently no reliable figures regarding the number of deaths, injuries, disappearances or arrests during those riots. Moreover, numerous MEPs have been banned from entering the Sahara, along with journalists who are still having serious problems doing their work. Morocco is Europe’s friend and strategic ally, and it is not good to have doubts or misunderstandings between friends. If Morocco has nothing to hide, it must allow the clarification of what happened. Therefore, although it is true that the Moroccan Parliament has set up an investigative commission, I think it is essential that an international commission be set up, that European and politicians and journalists have freedom of access to the area and that the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara extend its mandate to the protection of human rights, both in the area controlled by Morocco and in the area controlled by Polisario. The Commission and the European governments, least of all the Spanish Government, cannot look the other way in response to this situation. Realpolitik
 must not be an excuse for turning a blind eye. They must request clarification regarding these serious events and ask Morocco and the Polisario to resume discussions as soon as possible in order to arrive at a peaceful agreement on the basis of the United Nations resolutions.

 Madam President, Judge Afiuni granted parole to Eligio Cedeño, in accordance with Venezuelan law and in line with the opinion of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions. This led to her incarceration in a maximum-security prison, in conditions that are putting her life in danger. President Chávez has publicly requested that the prosecutor seek the maximum penalty, and that the National Assembly pass a law to increase her sentence with retroactive effect. Amnesty International and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have indicated their great concern. This is not an isolated case, ladies and gentlemen. On the contrary, it demonstrates the autocratic and authoritarian drift of a regime that, alongside seemingly democratic elections, closes opposing media, orders confiscations and arrests political opponents, showing no respect for human rights and the rule of law. We have therefore requested that Judge Afiuni be freed immediately. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

 Mr President, the Sagrada Familia, 
the work of the brilliant, Catalonian architect, Antoni Gaudí, is a genuine icon of Barcelona throughout the world. It was declared to be a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) in 2005. Work is currently being done on the high-speed train that will cross the city by means of a tunnel that lies a mere four metres from the foundations of the Sagrada Familia. There are 38 technical reports opposing these works. The International Council on Monuments and Sites, a specialist Unesco body, has expressed its concern about the route. Moreover, the lower house of the Spanish Parliament adopted a motion on 22 June to ask for a precautionary suspension of the works and the setting up of a committee of experts that could propose another solution within a time limit of two months. I would like to ask what measures the Commission is going to take to preserve a building as emblematic as is Barcelona’s Sagrada Familia against the risk represented by the passing of the high-speed train?

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against poverty and the other Millennium Development Goals should unite us all. I therefore regret the fact that some political groups have introduced certain issues that might make it difficult to achieve that unanimity. They are moral issues, such as proposing abortion as a method of birth control, or economic issues, such as introducing a tax on currency transactions. I think that this tax would be very difficult to implement, control and collect, and if it were not adopted across the board, especially in the main financial blocks, transactions would be moved to the countries where it was not in force. I regret that the report, which contains many positive points, will not receive unanimous support from all the political groups because of these particular issues. Santiago Fisas Ayxela,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mexico has a major problem with drugs trafficking and drug-related violence. To address this situation, the Government of President Felipe Calderón has adopted a tough stance in order to achieve its eradication: he has taken the decision to temporarily mobilise the armed forces, a move which has had a significant impact on the number of people arrested, the destruction of drugs and the confiscation of weapons. The army has accepted all the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission, including those concerning the investigation of complaints about their own conduct. The Government also recognises that it needs to make substantial changes in the area of security and justice, and is implementing an ambitious reform of the justice system in order for it to be more transparent and to bring to justice those who commit crimes, while respecting human rights. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wishes to show its solidarity with the Mexican people in the fight against drugs trafficking, and we support President Calderón in his willingness to combat organised crime. Finally, I would like to express my satisfaction with this agreement, which unites the main political Groups of this Parliament. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,

 Mr President, today is a very important day for all victims, particularly victims of terrorism, because on 11 September 2001, more than 3 000 innocent people died in several terrorist attacks in the United States. We cannot forget those who died in London and Madrid, or the many victims of terrorism in Europe, such as those of the ETA terrorist organisation in Spain, my country. Society as a whole is the victim in a terrorist attack, but a few citizens pay with their lives to defend our freedom. That is why, Mr President, I am dedicating part of my speaking time, including the time I have been allocated at the end of the debate, to observe one minute’s silence for all of these victims. (The House observed a minute’s silence)
 I should like to thank Commissioner Reding for the sensitivity she has shown towards victims, also the Council for its flexibility, and Ms Parvanova for her excellent work, as well as the Members of Parliament who have followed this report. Tomorrow will be crucial not only for victims but for all citizens, and believe me when I say that anyone can become a victim, as we can see from this compelling statistic: 75 million people a year are victims of crime in Europe. I believe it is time to give the victims the place they deserve, that is, at the centre of our debates in Parliament, because, even though the economic situation is our main concern today, I know that in most European countries, people are extremely worried about the way the justice system functions. This directive, which sends a clear message to victims that their rights will not be ignored and that they will be treated with respect and dignity, will serve to build people’s confidence in justice. The response to victims’ call for justice begins in Europe: a transparent and effective framework that restores citizens’ rights and the hope they have lost, in some cases, in their judicial system. Irrespective of their nationality or the place where the crime was committed, the victims will have the right to be informed, to understand and be understood, to legal counsel, and to be heard and protected. Victim support services will be able to provide psychological support and defend the victims at all times. I have heard many victims’ accounts, all of which were very traumatic, but necessary in order to understand the needs of the different types of victims; I would like to add that I dedicate this directive to them, especially to my brother, Alberto, and his wife, who will be looking down on me from heaven. In Parliament today, we are taking an important first step towards helping a father who has lost his son in another country, the victim of an attack, or a girl who has been raped and has no idea where to begin or what to tell the police. They are forced to go through that nightmare, and we are helping all of them here today. I hope this compass guides not only victims when they are crossing the desert of criminal proceedings, but also all those who must support them on their path of pain, such as judges, police officers and legal experts, including in cases involving children, and I also dedicate this directive to them. Today is a very important day for all victims: victims of gender violence, people trafficking, terrorism, organised crime, as well as child victims, victims with disabilities, and all those who have experienced the ordeal of a crime. Unfortunately, we cannot bring back people’s loved ones, nor can we restore their honour, the peace of mind they have lost, or their health, but all of us here today can promise them that we shall continue working towards giving them back their rights, dignity and belief in justice. I am committing myself and I call on the whole of Parliament to do the same with me tomorrow. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur. 
– (ES) 
Mr President, I should like once more to thank all those who have made it possible for this directive to become a reality: the secretariat, the Commission, the rapporteur, all those I am forgetting to mention and all my fellow Members who have supported us. I should like to say to every single victim without exception that, for us, they and their families have faces, names and are real people, and it is specifically on their behalf that we will work to ensure this directive is truly effective and – with the commitment and support of Commissioner Reding, of which I have no doubt whatsoever – is quickly and efficiently implemented, which is what all of us, and all citizens, want. I think there are various victims’ associations that would have wanted, and continue to want, their own directive, but I will make sure they know that the directive we shall vote on tomorrow does not overlook a single victim and, therefore, does not overlook them either. I am certain that this is the first important step and that it will be followed by many other steps that will open the doors of justice, which have been closed to victims for too long. When I am asked, as I often am in my country, what I do in Europe, I will be able to say with great pride that I am legislating in support of victims. That work is a great honour to me personally, and it motivates me to continue working. I am sure that, with the support and commitment of all those who are not only working here in the EU but also in our own countries, as well as your support, ladies and gentlemen, together we will succeed in putting an end to the situation of unjust neglect in which victims find themselves.

 Madam President, I have been denouncing female genital mutilation since I became a Member of Parliament. This silent and accepted crime is suffered by millions of women and girls throughout the world: 70 million, I repeat, 70 million. An unbearable figure for those who stop to examine the terrible consequences of these practices, hidden under the guises of psychological, health, and religious reasons, all of which are false. The truth is that circumcision, preferentially practised on 14-year-old girls, and even those aged one year old, can lead to death by haemorrhagic shock and, at best, cause and bring about strong psychological consequences from the trauma. We should strive with all our efforts in Europe to eradicate this violation of human rights, which infringes on the right to equal opportunities and puts health at risk. It is, ladies and gentlemen, abuse, cruelty and torture against girls, and this degrading treatment also occurs in Europe. We must therefore activate all the available prevention mechanisms in our legal system and encourage our judges to act to prevent the genital mutilation of girls in Europe, punishing those who carry it out. EU law has to speak with a single voice to combat the mutilation on our soil. Lastly, I call on civil society and NGOs to become actively involved in education and prevention campaigns. There is still a long way to go, but we are a large group who will not give up, as we owe it to the 70 million mutilated women. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 Madam President, from the European Parliament I wish to pay tribute to all women today because, despite the fact that we have made much progress since March 1911, when women took to the streets to demand the vote and better working conditions, I think that women’s equality is still a long way away. Today women can work without having to get permission from anyone but, in many cases, they continue to earn less than men for similar work, which is unacceptable. We must also remember women in rural areas, whose work goes unnoticed. I think that another uncomfortable truth, but one which we must continue to denounce, is violence against women. This year alone an excessive number of women have already been murdered, leaving aside serious threats from those who believe they have the right to perpetrate physical or psychological violence against women. It is time to say enough and to say it loud and clear. From this Parliament I reiterate my commitment to the European protection order for victims and to the Directive on the rights of victims which the Commission put forward and which will be voted upon next June, God willing. It also has to be said, and I should like to remind people, that motherhood is still an obstacle to the progression of women and I think this is a trend that should be changed. I want to send a message of hope: many women, with the help of more and more men, need to advance along the path of equal opportunities, rights and responsibilities. We have come a long way but there is a lot left to do. I have to admit that I do not believe in quotas in any way, shape or form but I must say that something has to be done and I agree with many of you and, of course, with Ms Reding, in opening this debate and advancing along that path so that women regain the place that they deserve and to that end you can count on my support. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur. 
– (ES)
 Madam President, I am pleased to know that the European protection order will be put to the vote and, in all probability, ratified by a large majority in this Chamber tomorrow. I say that from the heart as, since I entered this Parliament, I have been loyal in my commitment to the victims in defence of their rights, and one of the basic rights of any victim is to be suitably protected. My commitment extends to all citizens, as we are all potential victims of crime and we have the need to be able to live in a world and a European area of freedom, justice and security. With your votes in favour, we will be legislating to make life easier for the victims, who will feel equally protected in any country of the European Union going forward, without the need to initiate a new legal procedure with every move. In summary, we will make it easier for the victims to move around and we will limit their aggressors’ movements, which I consider to be a big step forward that I am delighted to have been able to make as the rapporteur for this report. The time is already upon us to stop allowing crime to cross borders, placing our lives at risk. We have the right and duty to protect ourselves, and this tool will serve that purpose. Despite the difficulties and the path we have taken during these two years of negotiations, which has not always been smooth, I want to thank the Polish Presidency today for having skilfully driven the negotiations. I also want to thank the Commission which, thanks to the vision of Ms Reding on presenting the legislative package relative to the victims and an additional regulation in civil law, has finally managed to dispel the Council’s doubts about the convenience of supporting the European protection order, along with opening the door to more wide-ranging legislation for the rights of the victims of crime and their support, on which I am working with a great deal of hope. I want to thank my co-rapporteur, Ms Romero, and also the Secretariat. When we return to our countries and people ask us ‘What do you do over there in Europe?’, given that they view our work as so distant and incomprehensible, this time I will be able to tell them that we have at least created an instrument, which we have ratified in this parliamentary session, which will protect so many people that suffer violence. I offer this future law for the many women killed through male violence, the many innocent people that suffer human trafficking without the possibility of escaping from their aggressors, the many defenceless children, the victims of terrorism that live with their terror, those that run from organised crime, and the many that don’t know where to go for fear of being pursued. We have taken a big step today towards the defence and protection of those that are most in need. I would like to conclude my speech with three words that are the guiding light in my work and life: freedom, justice and dignity. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur. 
– (ES)
 Madam President, I think it is very important to closely follow the application of the European protection order. We refer to filing a report, but these reports should be followed by real protection. We need troops: we can approve good laws, but if we do not provide countries with the necessary means, the victims will not feel confident and they will continue to keep quiet for fear of being assaulted again. Therefore, it is necessary that the judges and the police have the training and means to be able to do their job properly. That is real justice. So many victims complain about the application of a law that does not meet their needs. It is necessary, therefore, that we pool our efforts, that we insist on the statistics to see how this instrument is working, which I believe is really necessary. I ask the Member States to make the effort to understand and apply this regulation, as that’s what we have worked for, and we consider that we have made it clear. I think that from now on, the doors to victim rights are wide open in Europe, that women and men can count on this, and other instruments, which will make victims come forward and put a stop to those that they fear. Today through our voices, and tomorrow through our votes, we will tell the victims that we will never forget their rights in the European Parliament, the support that society owes them, and mostly importantly, justice. I can tell you that it is justice that keeps all the victims alive, regardless of the crime committed against them. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 Madam President, as rapporteur of the report on the drafting of a directive on the rights of victims of crimes, including terrorism, and as a Spaniard who has personally suffered the cruelty of the terrorist organisation ETA, I would like to thank President Buzek for his support for my country and its victims. I understand the pleasure that many people feel at this new statement from ETA, but I must remind you that it is still too soon to celebrate, because they have not yet handed over their weapons, nor disbanded, nor asked their victims for forgiveness. Ladies and gentlemen, it is also important for you to realise that we do not have to reach any kind of peace between the two sides in Spain, because there has not been a war. My brother, Alberto Jiménez-Becerril, who was murdered by ETA along with his wife in Seville, was not returning from war. He was going home, where his three children, who would never see him again, were waiting for him. We have the obligation to tell my brother’s children that his parents were better than their murderers. If we accept an end without winners or losers, we will be showing these children that you can achieve political objectives by killing. So I ask Parliament not to allow itself to be hoodwinked by the ETA terrorists and their accomplices, and to listen to the sincere voices of the victims. The only thing they want is the peace that comes from justice. (Applause) Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I would like to say to everyone that there is only one kind of terrorism, simply that which destroys innocent lives. Where it comes from is not an issue. The victims of terrorism, whom I represent, given that the ETA terrorist organisation killed my brother and his wife, share a common thread, and on their behalf, I would like to say that this report, with such a long title, could have been ambitious, but it is not. It is a disappointing outcome. This report does not represent us, it does not represent hopes for justice, or the balance between freedom and security that we talk about so much here. It does not represent us, and I believe that a report on terrorism should acknowledge the victims of terrorism, but this does not. Therefore, I ask you to vote against this report. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 Mr President, in defence of fundamental rights, I call on the responsible institutions to review the designation of San Sebastián as European Capital of Culture, because I believe that it was chosen on the basis of political criteria, which constitutes discrimination against the other candidate cities. The chairman of the panel said the city was chosen to support the peace process but, as far as I am aware, there is a terrorist organisation in Spain, called ETA, that so far has not laid down its weapons and which two months ago managed to get its political wing, Bildu, into government in San Sebastián, as well as other towns. I do not believe that Europe should be giving such a powerful megaphone to people who fail to condemn terrorist violence and who will create propaganda out of apportioning blame between victims and murderers. Where is the right to freedom and dignity? Clearly not in San Sebastián, where our fellow Members such as Mayor Oreja, Mr Iturgaiz, Mr Zalba, and I myself have to go around with bodyguards. I believe in the culture of life, not in a bullet to the back of the head. Ladies and gentlemen, can there be any true culture without freedom? No, a thousand times no. San Sebastián should once again submit its candidacy when it is a city that is free for everyone. In the meantime, they should learn the culture of respect towards those who think differently, because although the city may deserve the title in future, today, with Batasuna and its successors in its institutions, it does not.

Mr President, the most important thing, and that which is uniting us here today, are the victims, because nobody should feel as unprotected as we, the European consumers, feel at the moment. Furthermore, we need clarity and responsibility in respect of the victims. It is my responsibility to denounce the German authorities, who, wrongly and hastily, accused Spanish cucumbers and, more specifically, the cooperatives of Malaga and Almeria, which were model operations and which will not recover from these accusations. Thousands of jobless families are wondering why – and they need an answer – and, in particular, they want to know what the future holds for them, not just in Andalusia, but throughout European agriculture. Therefore, and in the hope that the experts will soon find the solution, I demand that today, when the Commission speaks to the Council, it asks for immediate and moral economic measures for all the producers from Andalusia and from the whole of Europe, who are looking towards us with indignation, but also with hope. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,

 Mr President, on most occasions that I have spoken in Parliament, it has been to denounce violence against women, and I am here again to combat it. I must say that not only do I not tire of doing this, but I think that it is essential to continue to speak out in public about this violation of human rights, as you cannot defend a cause without a sounding board. Furthermore, this Parliament is the best loudspeaker available to me to defend all those women who suffer daily from abuse and who need us, as legislators, to compel the Member States to punish the perpetrators of this aggression in a manner that befits the seriousness of the crime, and also to provide assistance to the victims. When, according to estimates, one in four women in Europe has suffered gender violence at least once in her life, and the same proportion of children, I believe that we cannot but demand greater commitment, as has been recognised by the Commission in its action plan. I believe that we must keep on insisting, time and time again, in order to protect victims, as we did with the European Protection Order, for which I was rapporteur, and I hope that it will come into effect as soon as possible. This report has benefited from a great measure of consensus and support from the outset. This shows that when we tackle domestic violence, which affects all family members, including children, the elderly, women and men, this should not provide the opportunity for political opportunism, as it does us all great credit to be making progress towards finding a solution to this scourge of our society. The first thing we must do is to speak up, and the second is to get down to work, for, although we have spent decades speaking about gender violence, we have not managed to reduce the number of deaths. We must be doing something wrong, and therefore, it is time to leave demagogy aside and to move from words to actions. We must give more genuine assistance and apply the legislation that women need if they are to live in dignity and safety. I want all the victims to know that I shall always be here to speak up for them, until the day that, by working together, we manage to defeat this terrible enemy, which sadly ends the lives of so many innocent victims. What I say is: we have had enough. It cannot go on. I ask all of you to say likewise. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Madam President, today is a very significant day to talk about equality between men and women because we are celebrating International Women’s Day, remembering those who fought for women’s working and economic rights and their right to vote 100 years ago. We have made considerable progress in those 100 years, but much remains to be done. True equality is still a dream and discrimination against women is a fact of life. I believe that every one of us, both men and women, can do a lot more to achieve true emancipation for women. There are many women in the world whose right to life is being threatened, whose dignity is being violated, and whose freedom is being denied. Allow me, on this International Women’s Day, to demonstrate my support and hope to all women fighting for their democratic rights in the revolution in North Africa. Women cannot be worth half what men are in Arab counties or anywhere in the world. We are worth the same and deserve the same. I will continue fighting to achieve that equality and International Women’s Day will continue to exist until it is achieved. Even if there are many who do not want to see it, the reality is that there are women who earn half of what men do and that domestic violence mainly affects women and children. I must repeat that these facts must continue to be reported in Parliament, and I promise to continue working toward that, of course. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Mr President, while not wishing to take the comparison between terrorism and immigration too far, I have observed that unfortunately, EU action is driven by emergency situations, such as a serious attack or a mass landing of immigrants, as is currently happening in Lampedusa, where the exodus of Tunisians to the Italian coast could culminate in a chronicle of a death foretold. The voyage of hope could end up becoming a cursed voyage, and it will be on the consciences of all of us who witness these continuous uncontrolled influxes and do not say ‘enough is enough’ with sufficient authority. When it happens, we will throw up our hands in horror, but the following day we will forget about it. Europeans have a duty and a right to know the truth: that the Mediterranean strategy is not working, that the common immigration policy will continue to be a dream until European countries commit to equipping the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) with sufficient resources to be effective. Talking does not cost anything, but we need to act. Do you really believe that Frontex is currently able to guarantee the security of the European borders? I do not believe it is. Let us hope that the people of Egypt, Tunisia and other countries of the Maghreb do not decide en masse
 to seek a better future in Europe, but rather that they do so in their own countries, because that is what they have fought for, and we must help them. Solidarity and responsibility are therefore required, along with, above all, truth when talking about a common European immigration policy, which is now more necessary than ever. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, today is an important day for all victims, because today we shall adopt the European Protection Order, which is a significant step forward in terms of their rights. Victims are unfairly forgotten about, and it is paradoxical that aggressors often have many more rights and that there is more said about aggressors’ rights than victims’ rights. Today, Parliament will honour all victims, reminding those who believe that the borders will shield them while they persecute their victims, that this European Protection Order will protect all victims equally in the European Union from this day onwards. We started working more than a year ago to achieve this objective and make progress with the area of freedom and security that was mentioned in the Stockholm Programme, and today we can say with a degree of pride that, although the path has not been easy, as many people have frequently failed to understand the order, and doubted its effectiveness and clarity, we have achieved it. I must say that, following the trialogues with the Belgian Presidency, and many conversations with the Commission, we have achieved a text that almost all the political groups were happy with. This report was therefore adopted by a huge majority with no votes against in the joint vote by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. I hope that today, Parliament will reflect the decision made by those committees and by those of us who produced this report, which was adopted by a huge majority. This would send a clear message to the Council about what Europeans want, which is nothing more than to live in an area of security and justice, to be protected, and for a victim who has a restraining order against her aggressor in her country not to have to begin further court proceedings when she moves to another country. We have an obligation to facilitate access to justice for Europeans, and especially for victims, who are the most vulnerable. The protection of all victims, without exception, has been my beacon throughout the development of this report. I therefore wanted to include victims of terrorism, people trafficking, organised crime and honour crimes, along with a special chapter for minors, who are the most vulnerable victims, and we never think about how to protect them. Although this order will protect all victims, women who suffer from domestic violence will benefit most from this instrument for judicial cooperation, as their aggressors will not be able to travel through Europe with impunity, and will know that they will be pursued in the same way as in the country where they attacked their partners. Parliament must therefore send a clear message to the Council today about what we want. We will therefore vote with our eyes fixed on the victims, on those who suffer, on those who need us to protect them, on those who are afraid and need to live in freedom and hope. We are not going to give up on such a fair and necessary aim that is supported by the majority of Europeans just because there are some who are afraid and never dare to take that one step further. We need to be brave, the Member States need to be brave, and I hope that the vote today will be a majority in favour and encourage those who still have doubts as to whether this instrument will open a door for victims. I also hope that in the near future, the Commission will put forward wide-ranging legislation in favour of victims’ rights, for which it has my full support and, I am sure, Parliament’s support. I repeat: this small but major step that is the European Protection Order will improve protection for all victims, preventing further crimes and relieving the consequences of those that have already been committed. Today, we have an obligation to remove the obstacles that have so far prevented real protection across Europe. Through our vote today, we have the opportunity to save lives, which is what we are going to do, and we should be genuinely proud of that. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES) 
Madam President, I think that in this debate, we have clearly seen that we are all in agreement in supporting the objective of this report. The various political groups have shown their support for this directive, which offers greater protection to victims. My question is, therefore: what obstacles are there to adopting this instrument? I repeat: what fears are there regarding something as essential and simple as protecting victims equally across Europe finally becoming a reality? In the hope that Parliament will adopt this report by a majority, I would like to address the Council and the Commission to remind them that we have overcome the legal hurdles in our negotiations, and I welcome the fact that the Commission acknowledges our work, just as we acknowledge the work that it will do in the future. We should not therefore exclude ourselves, but rather help ourselves by adopting this more specific instrument today, and tomorrow by adopting the broader package of measures to help victims that will be presented by the Commission, with which I promise to cooperate. Let us therefore be brave and responsible, and let us help all those who have the right to live in a safer Europe. I repeat: let us help everyone, be they men, women or children. Let us help those who are looking to us today to give them a better life, a life that will restore to them their freedom, their security and, above all, their dignity.

Mr President, I have asked for the floor to remind you of the importance of today’s vote in order to send a clear message to the Council, aimed at the countries that have still not equipped themselves with security in this field. I believe that today, we have an opportunity to defend victims and ensure that they can live without fear and in freedom. It is very important, not only for women, but also for men, children, victims of terrorism, victims of organised crime, victims of trafficking of women and for victims in general.

Mr President, last month, I organised a hearing in this Parliament concerning the victims of terrorism, which was attended by the President of Parliament and various Members of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). The victims have turned to us, as their representatives in Europe, to guarantee them their right to justice which has been trampled on so many times in their own countries, such as Spain, where the Rodríguez Zapatero Government continues to lie to the Spanish people about a negotiation process with a terrorist group which has still not relinquished its arms. It is because of this that such grave incidents as the Bar Faisán
 tip off, in which the terrorists were warned of the operation in progress to arrest them, have still not been thoroughly investigated. Democratic governments cannot turn their backs on the victims of terrorism; they have already paid the highest price in the fight for liberty. Parliament must push for a European Charter which recognises the legitimate demands of the victims, such as not negotiating with terrorists and ensuring that they serve their prison sentences in full.

Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Human Rights, as a Spanish and European citizen, and as a victim of terrorism since the terrorist organisation ETA murdered my brother and his wife in Seville, I am speaking here today to condemn the fact that the Venezuelan Government and its President has allowed ETA terrorists to train on Venezuelan soil on the orders of the alleged terrorist, Arturo Cubillas, who works for Hugo Chávez’s government despite the fact that there is an international warrant out for his arrest; this is a serious violation of the fundamental right to all European citizens’ right to security. I demand firm action from the Spanish Government in response to this serious humiliation of all the Spanish people. Mr Zapatero cannot continue to keep quiet while the Venezuelan Ambassador describes the members of our Civil Guard, who have been, and will continue to be, models of bravery in the fight against ETA, as torturers. Nor can he look the other way as cooperation on Venezuelan soil between ETA and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia grows, which has already been condemned by the Judge Eloy Velasco. Mr Zapatero cannot shake the hand of a leader such as Mr Chávez, who is turning Venezuela into a haven for terrorists. The Prime Minister of a country such as Spain, where terrorism has caused so much pain, cannot continue to ignore this problem and should give the response that such a situation deserves, which is what any ordinary citizen would do if they had the opportunity.

 Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity in this House today, as I was unable to do so on the ‘European Day for the Victims of Terrorism’ on 11 March, to pay a well-deserved tribute to these victims in recognition of the enormous sacrifice made by those who have paid the ultimate price in the name of freedom. We urgently need to start to work on a directive to protect the rights of the victims of terrorism, who are always the ones who are overlooked and who suffer the humiliation of being unjustly equated with their murderers. It is high time that we within these European institutions recognise the dignity of the victims of terrorism, and help to defend their right to protection and justice. This right should soon be embodied in a law that honours all those who make this possible, whose first article should state that support to victims of terrorism entails recognition of their right to justice and that no government should ever pay a price for this. I call on all those in a position to defend the victims never to forget that true peace is a peace born of justice, and that is the only peace that those of us who believe in freedom and democracy in Europe and anywhere else in the world should defend. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to say that I did not come to Parliament to applaud the brand new law in Spain on abortion. What I am concerned about is human life, and I am particularly concerned about the women – who I am here to defend – whose lives are in danger as a result of gender violence, and I am here to offer them a space in which they can live freely and safely. Parliament’s Resolution of 2 February 2006 recommended that the Member States adopt an attitude of zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women, and that they adopt the necessary measures to ensure better protection for victims. The Stockholm Programme, which was adopted in this House, established an area of freedom, justice and security for all European citizens, and combating gender violence was considered to be a priority in that programme. This reflected my request for the Spanish Presidency to promote a European protection order for the victims of gender violence during its mandate, to ensure that the victims of these crimes have the same level of protection in all the Member States. In a Europe without borders, the fight against gender violence should also be without borders, and the Member States should work hard to harmonise their legislation so that the fight against ill-treatment of women overcomes the legislative obstacles in its way and we can finally protect the lives of women and their children, at least within the European Union, I therefore ask the Commission and the Council to do everything that is necessary and everything in their power to move forward with the European protection order for victims, which is a very effective instrument for ensuring that those who fail to respect the dignity of women and their right to live freely and safely do not go unpunished. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Mr President, when dealing with a topic as serious as terrorism, we should not wait for things to happen before we act. We should anticipate events, but we do not. Unfortunately, we only change in response to each attack, such as the failed attack in Detroit, which is forcing us today to take decisions to ensure the safety of air transport. Taking a decision on body scanners in airports is a responsibility that we cannot avoid, ladies and gentlemen. We cannot wait any longer because the terrorists are not waiting. Consequently, the Commission must guarantee, as soon as possible, that the dignity and privacy of individuals will be preserved and that there will be no harmful effects on health. Once this is guaranteed, we must adopt decisions for the European Union as a whole. To those who are worried about infringement of our fundamental rights, I say that there is no greater right than the right to life, and those of us who cherish freedom above all else must be able to live safely in order to feel truly free. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 According to a United Nations report, in 2009, some 270 000 people were victims of human trafficking within the European Union. With these figures in mind, we need to ensure that European Union action is based, first and foremost, on victim protection, with special focus on the situation of women and children, who are the most vulnerable. We cannot continue to stand by and remain indifferent to the play that is being enacted, to the sideshow of sexual exploitation that is unfolding before our eyes. For this reason, I completely support the Parliament’s demands that victim assistance should be unconditional and that more forceful methods and more severe penalties should be adopted, as Mr Barrot has just told us. Having said that, I would like to call on the Spanish Presidency, the European Commission and the Council to use all the European legislation at their disposal, both existing and future legislation, to protect the victims of human trafficking. I consider that the proposed European victim protection system, which I personally demanded from the Spanish Presidency during the Stockholm Programme debates, and which has finally come to fruition, will be an effective instrument for fighting such crimes. I hope for a firm undertaking, as we have already seen, from the Spanish Presidency, to ensure that this system offers victims special protective measures that will be effective throughout the European Union. I hope that we who are responsible for taking action against the most severe problems in our society will come up with a real and substantial response to this extremely severe problem of human trafficking and that our words will not be empty promises. We really owe it to all the victims. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to say that the majority of governments and citizens only remember the victims of terrorism after a serious attack such as the ones in Madrid, New York or London. Once the wave of emotion has passed, they tend to forget about the terrorist threat and the rights of victims. Today, however, there is no doubt about the European Union’s commitment to the fight against terrorism. As Commissioner Barrot has just told us, this commitment has also been reflected in the recently adopted Stockholm Programme, which recognises the courage and dignity of the victims and the need to defend their rights. Despite this progress, the fight against terrorism has always been based on trust and mutual cooperation between the Member States. Taking into account the perspective offered by the Treaty of Lisbon, I wonder whether it would be a good idea for the European Union to promote harmonisation of the legislation of the Member States on the rights of victims of terrorism. The adoption of a European charter of the rights of victims of terrorism would be a big step forward that would help those fighting terrorism and would be a strong blow for those that defend it. It is the courage and dignity of the victims that is the greatest failure of terrorism and therefore the greatest triumph of democracy. We should never forget that the only weapon that innocent victims have against terrorism is their word and the recognition of society. Therefore, you should also not forget, ladies and gentlemen, that none of us are safe from being victims of terrorism. My question is, therefore: would the Commission agree with adopting a European charter to recognise the defence of the rights of the victims of terrorism and to promote those rights? If so, what measures would the new Commission take to drive forward this Charter under its new mandate? Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, today there is no doubt about the European Union’s commitment to the fight against terrorism, and thanks to the Stockholm Programme, we will continue to make progress on this essential area of freedom, security and justice. In my view, this fight has been based on mutual trust between the Member States, but now, with the possibilities opened up by the Treaty of Lisbon, it is high time to harmonise national legislation so that there is no time limit on prosecuting terrorist crimes, which should be considered as crimes against humanity. When this happens, nobody in this Parliament or in any other will defend terrorists, as has happened, is happening and may continue to happen, to the detriment of victims of terrorism, who watch those who murdered their loved ones being treated like heroes, while they suffer in silence. I therefore ask Parliament to drive forward or adopt a European charter for the rights of the victims of terrorism, based on defending the memory… (The President cut off the speaker) Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate you as the Commission’s proposal on the employment package is very important. It is an ambitious and difficult challenge in the context of the current crisis, but we have to achieve the objective of the Europe 2020 strategy and create new jobs. To achieve this objective, the job markets need to be reformed so that they are more dynamic and inclusive, with workers trained in appropriate skills so they are more resistant to economic adjustment processes, and make full use of their potential for job creation during growth periods. Hiring needs to be stimulated through tax incentives that: promote and support self-employment and business start-ups, back innovative sectors with a high potential for job creation, improve the job market situation for the most vulnerable groups, such as young people and women, and fight against informal or non-declared employment. It is also important to note, however, that despite the high unemployment rate, there are increasingly more vacancies to be filled due to a lack of personnel with the appropriate skills. This gap needs to be filled by better planning for the needs of the job market and encouraging geographical mobility. In this sense, decisive progress needs to be made towards the creation of a European job market. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, our objective in the area of employment and social issues should continue to be the Europe 2020 strategy. Unfortunately, however, and partly due to the erroneous policies of previous governments, there are some countries, including my own, where there is no longer any room to manoeuvre and the only option left is to apply very rigorous budgetary adjustment programmes to tackle the sovereign debt crisis. Unemployment has reached unacceptable levels and continues to rise in some countries, with young people in a particularly serious situation. Poverty and the risk of social exclusion have increased considerably. There is a greater need than ever to redirect spending towards growth and job creation, and to avoid cutbacks in social policies that would further exacerbate the situation faced by the weakest in society. Fiscal consolidation is a necessary condition, but it is not enough to exit the crisis. Fiscal consolidation, growth and job creation should go hand in hand. The priority elements of national programmes and European Union social policy should be integrated, active inclusion strategies, measures to support sustainable job creation, particularly for the young, and, ultimately, carrying out the necessary reform of our labour markets, as is currently taking place in Spain.

 Madam President, Commissioner, poverty is the cause of the great inequalities on our planet. We cannot accept a system in the 21st century that continues to exacerbate differences between people because of their place of birth, gender, or their country’s development prospects. It is vital to create a new social, employment and economic framework that will ensure the basic needs of our population. Around 80 million people live below the poverty line, of whom more than half are women and 20 million are children. The platform that is the subject of this report could help to achieve greater social justice in Europe. It calls for priority to be placed on education and youth policies as a key element around which to build a fairer and more just society; for an overhaul of the insecure employment contracts that have proliferated in many Member States, undermining protection of the weakest groups in society; for the recognition of the rights of women living in rural areas, whose work is not valued and who are excluded from the basic rights enjoyed by all workers; and for an improvement in national home care programmes for the elderly. The austerity measures that are so badly needed at this time of crisis must not be incompatible with maintaining basic social services. Some 116 million people are threatened by poverty in the European Union, and 42 million live in conditions of severe material deprivation. We must ensure these people’s social protection and create a more prosperous environment that will help to reduce these figures. Lastly, I would like to say how pleased I am with the Council’s decision, following several months of stalled negotiations, to release food aid for the poorest members of society. It is essential to maintain this economic support in the new 2014-2020 funding cycle, with an annual maximum amount of EUR 500 million. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, at a time when Europe is experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis, with unemployment at 9.5%, I think it is very positive to discuss the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs today, and I want to congratulate Ms Bastos on the quality of her report, which forms part of the Europe 2020 strategy and will make a key contribution towards achieving the ambitious target of a 75% employment rate within the European Union. The 23 million unemployed Europeans demand that institutions and governments take the necessary measures and adopt the reforms that guarantee competitiveness in the job market and the creation of jobs. This agenda is on the right track, and we will only achieve this aim by working together within a strengthened single market. I want to make a specific reference to one of the sectors that create most jobs within the Union, and which is suffering the most at present: small and medium-sized enterprises. The importance of SMEs in the European Union is clear if we bear in mind that they generate 84% of jobs. In my country, Spain, that figure is even higher. This means we have to focus our efforts on the flexibility of the job market, the removal of cumbersome processes that slow down company creation, and to provide incentives for the self-employed and SMEs. Job flexibility and security will be key for understanding future legislation, job mobility and the productive collaboration between training institutions and companies. Veronica Lope Fontagné,

Madam President, first of all I would like to draw attention to the significant contribution that cohesion policy has made to economic growth and to the integration of the citizens and territories of the EU. For this reason, it was essential that Parliament should have its say on the policy to be followed from 2013 and it would be unfair to fail to mention the work carried out by Mr Pieper in his extensive report. Within cohesion policy the European Social Fund has been and will be a very important tool to assist Member States to adapt their policies to the Europe 2020 strategy and to combat the financial crisis. The Fund must concentrate its efforts on creating employment, promoting lifelong learning, helping in particular low-skilled workers, those outside the labour market, along with the most vulnerable groups, those who suffer discrimination and, of course, SMEs. It should also aim to achieve social inclusion and reduce poverty. In order to achieve these objectives it is imperative for the Social Fund, as part of the Structural Funds, to count on adequate resources and that administrative and procedural burdens are relaxed as much as possible and reduced to a minimum.

There are various reasons for supporting coal aid: strategic reasons, regional sustainability reasons and social reasons. With regard to the strategic reasons, we need to take into account the fact that the market is changing rapidly. Therefore, abandoning coal without having a viable alternative would not be appropriate. The environmental argument is not relevant either, as imported coal is equally as polluting as indigenous coal. Moreover, we should not forget that, on many occasions, the mines from which we import coal do not comply with social rights. With regard to regional sustainability, in many cases, the mines are in sparsely populated areas that are entirely dependent on the industry to maintain the region, and we risk turning our lands into deserts. The final and most important reason is the more than 180 000 families that could be affected. In Spain, in my region of Aragon, we are pioneers of renewable energy sources, with almost 60% energy independence. The only resource that we can store is coal, and we need more time in order to improve our technologies and apply them to mining, thus transforming our indigenous coal into clean, sustainable coal.

Madam President, Europe needs a strategy that will enable it to emerge stronger from the economic and financial crisis and tackle the long-term challenges that it has to face, such as, for example, the ageing population. In the strategy for the next decade, the Europe 2020 strategy, employment policy has to play a very important role. Its objectives must be sustainable growth, job creation and seeking greater social cohesion, and combating poverty is a new priority for the Union to which my group is committed. The strategy demonstrates the need to undertake structural reforms in order to improve the way that labour markets operate, while also improving competitiveness and productivity. We would not be consistent if we only thought about job creation in the future and allowed existing jobs to be destroyed, as is occurring in some sectors such as the coal sector at the moment, where a large number of jobs could be lost across Europe. Mining needs to be maintained as a strategic reserve and to complement renewable energy sources. If you will allow me, I will talk about my country, Spain, and my region, Aragon. For one of the provinces, Teruel – where the population density is around 12 inhabitants per square metre – the loss of around 5 000 jobs would mean the desertification of a whole area of land. We therefore need to focus, on the one hand, on consolidating and maintaining the jobs that we have at the moment and, on the other, on undertaking the reforms set out in this report.

 Madam President, we believe it to be essential to include the self-employed in this directive, and this view is shared by the representatives of both unions and employers’ associations in my country, who have expressly requested the inclusion of the self-employed in this directive. We believe that there are several reasons for their inclusion. Firstly, because of workers’ safety: self-employed hauliers deserve the same protection as other hauliers, not just when they are driving, but also when they are undertaking other tasks that are directly related to a road transport operation. Secondly, for reasons of fair competition, as bringing back discrimination between self-employed and employed workers will distort both the labour market and the transport market. Finally, it also seems inappropriate to me that each Member State should be able to apply the provisions of the directive to drivers if it so wishes. There needs to be a general rule for the entire EU, since the majority of hauliers work outside their own countries; without it, fair competition would be impeded. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, the future 2020 strategy must enable the European Union to correct the shortcomings detected in the Lisbon Strategy if we really want to create a competitive economic space, and one that is economically, socially and territorially cohesive. In spite of the fact that the postulates of the by now outdated Lisbon Strategy are still valid, I would like to point out that one of the reasons why it lost force was because of its highly complex structure, particularly its lack of clarity in defining the responsibilities and tasks incumbent upon the European Union and other levels of government, particularly those of a regional and local nature. Regions and local authorities must be included in the design and implementation of policies if we want the 2020 strategy to bear any fruit in the medium term. Our regions and cities are key agents in the development and implementation of a great deal of EU public investment related to growth and employment. The allocation of regional policy resources thus becomes a key factor in terms of meeting the European objectives that we are defining. I would like to point out that the resources invested from 2000 to 2006 by way of the European Regional Development Fund have enabled the creation of 1 400 000 jobs in the European Union, as well as the building of over 2 000 km of motorways. I would like to finish by pointing out once more the value of the European regional policy with respect to strategic goals such as growth and employment. Economic, social and territorial cohesion represents a basic objective guaranteed by the treaties. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately we are having to deal with this sad and now customary matter once again. I would like to express my respect and gratitude to all the professionals and volunteers who have contributed to the rescue and reconstruction effort in the affected areas, and I would like to express my particular condolences to the families of the victims. We need to provide help to the victims and pave the way so that the affected areas can recover quickly. We also need to continue working intensively in the area of prevention. Finally, and most importantly, I would call on the Spanish Government to use its current Presidency of the European Union to provide the impetus needed to modify the current European Union Solidarity Fund Regulation – a request already made on a number of occasions by the European Parliament – in order to achieve faster, more flexible and more efficient access to it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wish to express my solidarity with the families of all those affected by the dreadful news of the closure of the Antwerp plant. We are thinking not only of all those who will be directly affected and lose their jobs, but also of all the subcontracting companies that will suffer as a result. We must keep them in mind too. The Figueruelas plant is in my region, Aragón, so this matter affects us directly. We therefore advocate an active policy for the automotive sector, with new models that are more environmentally friendly and innovative and lead to the creation of new jobs.

Mr President, I would like to talk about the aid approved under the Temporary Framework aimed at reducing the problems that have arisen as a result of the economic crisis, and specifically about Opel. I would like to ask you whether the Commission is examining whether the aid received by Germany under the Temporary Framework was dependent on a prior agreement regarding the geographical distribution of the restructuring measures, which would not be in line with the purpose of this aid. If this is the case, I would like to know whether you agree with the company having the freedom to revise the distribution and restructuring of Opel according to its own economic and production criteria and maintaining the greatest possible number of jobs. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, when it was proposed that we have a debate in plenary on the future of Opel Europe, we were not yet aware of the purchase of the company by Magna and its Russian partner, Sberbank, on Thursday. After months of uncertainty, a new phase is beginning for Opel Europe which, for some, is grounds for hope, while for others, grounds for concern. We want the conditions of the final contract, which will be signed in the next few months, to be positive for the future of the company, and I hope that the German Government is right in thinking that this is the most reliable offer for the survival of the company. However, as a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and as someone from Aragon, where the Figueruelas factory, which is currently one of the most productive plants, is located, I must express my concern regarding the fate of the workers. There is talk that in its restructuring plan, Magna is considering making 10 560 workers redundant – currently 1 700 at the Aragon plant – to which many indirect redundancies will have to be added. We are aware that in order to save the company, there needs to be major restructuring, and that this will affect our workers, but we hope that the plan will be made using economic and productivity criteria, seeking to arrive at the best solution for everyone. We trust that, in the coming months, the governments of the affected countries will get involved along with Europe. This will mean that together, using economic criteria, we can support the viability of Opel with the lowest possible cost to the workers at all its European plants. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, in this first plenary sitting of the legislature, we have to deal with this sad and now customary issue: natural disasters and, in particular, fires. Once again we are lamenting the proliferation of fires during the summer of 2009, which have caused human losses. Twenty lives have been lost, all in my country. Therefore, my first thought and my utmost sympathy is for the human suffering caused by these catastrophes. I would like to stress the disastrous impact that this type of disaster has on the lives of the populations that are affected, on their economies, employment, natural and cultural heritage, the environment and tourism. In my region, 22 000 hectares burned this summer, half of which were in areas that are protected due to their environmental importance. We must respond to these problems without hesitation, the people are demanding it. The European institutions cannot be incapable once more of finding an adequate solution for those who are affected. We need to be able to help the victims and to pave the way for restoring the affected areas. We need to continue to work hard on prevention and to proceed further with developing the European civil protection service. I would like to make two calls: firstly, I would like to call on the European Commission to analyse the situation and adopt the appropriate measures to compensate for the social costs inherent in the loss of jobs and sources of income for the inhabitants of the affected regions. Secondly, I would like to call on the Spanish Government, which will hold the Presidency of the Council from January 2010. The Spanish Government must be capable of passing on its feeling and concern to its counterparts. I consider it essential that it makes it a priority in its programme to unblock the reform of the European Solidarity Fund. The Spanish Presidency must also make a clear commitment to developing a common European strategy. It must also review prevention measures and the forestry management models that encourage large fires.Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

Mr President, Commissioner, without ignoring the fact that data protection is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the current Directive was born of the desire to harmonise national provisions on data retention, in order to ensure the availability of those data for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, such as terrorism or organised crime.  This harmonisation is necessary because the inefficiency arising from the fragmentation created by national provisions has been demonstrated in studies and through practical experience. We therefore need to ensure the continued retention, at European level, of data that are generated or processed.  A recent example of how these data can be used in a judicial context as a tool to fight crime is the arrest in Spain on 4 October 2012 of a young man planning to imitate the Columbine massacre by planting bombs at universities in the Balearic Islands. Following a police investigation using data obtained from electronic communications, it was ascertained that the young man had bought various explosive substances and items of equipment needed to make homemade bombs. As a result, it was possible to prevent a real tragedy.  Nevertheless, I call on the Commission to present an urgent proposal for the revision of the legal framework for data retention, because the importance and sensitivity of this matter means that we cannot continue with a Directive that has technical shortcomings and intrudes, sometimes disproportionately, on the right to privacy.

 Maintaining international peace and security is one of the EU’s primary objectives. Currently, in our struggle to achieve democratic stability, we should not forget Latin America, which is facing important challenges, as already mentioned: democratic consolidation, regional integration, economic and social stability, poverty and, of course, security in the region. On the other hand, our Latin American neighbours share our values and principles, and they have a number of emerging countries such as Brazil and Mexico, which are key members of international forums such as the G20; finally, the region has great economic potential, with 10% growth forecast for the coming decade. In view of this, I believe that next autumn, the European External Action Service should focus strongly on the multi-party trade agreement between Peru, Colombia and the EU, the association agreement with Central America, and the negotiation of the development cooperation instrument. This is a key region for the EU, and we cannot gradually withdraw right when it is expanding the most. In conclusion, the EU is, and should become, even more aware and involved in conflict prevention and the struggle to maintain security. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the report we are debating today is a big step forward for all victims of crime and barbarity. Its progress lies in its due recognition of victims, and it gives more guarantees to the criminal procedure. Quite simply, victims will now have more legal certainty and society will be more sensitive to their suffering and pain. May I congratulate the two rapporteurs for their excellent work and tenacity, and I would particularly like to mention Ms Jiménez-Becerril, twice a victim of terrorism; through her committed campaigning and the complicity I so admire in Commissioner Reding, they have opened a door through which others will follow, so that judges, leaders and civil society can properly recognise the value, example and trauma of so many victims, providing them with guarantees, justice and respect. Today, Mr President, I would also like to send a message of solidarity to the people of the United States for the terrible tragedy that took place on that 11 September. I send them a testimony of my solidarity in a heartfelt prayer. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 I understand that many issues must be taken into account in the debate on the future of the common agricultural policy (CAP), in the context of the debate on the multiannual financial framework and on the transitory period for 2013, but they should not cause us to forget the urgent need to secure our farmers’ present and future. The economic crisis threatens the sector’s survival, so we need to guarantee the level of aid granted to farms, especially in the countries where we are suffering most from the crisis, such as Spain. The necessary financial discipline should not lead to a drastic adjustment of the CAP or a radical reduction in existing funds. I want to express my doubts regarding a possible single rate, even if it is greater than 50%, as it would mean the most vulnerable regions paying more, while ‘budgetary restrictions’ are being required of the country. This is a complicated debate but, now more than ever, we must increase our efforts to strengthen the CAP as part of the backbone of the EU, not forgetting decisive support for those regions and countries being hit particularly hard by the economic crisis.

 Mr President, this afternoon’s debate is neither new, nor is the issue limited to Romania, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria; it affects all Member States. These are the three affected countries today, but this could happen to any other on other occasions. This House, in fact, in its Declaration of 8 March 2011, has already asked the Commission to establish a new mechanism that will guarantee complete reciprocity for all Member States, ensuring that if a third country fails to reciprocate the visa regime, all Member States would enforce obligatory visa requirements for the citizens of that country. The principles of reciprocity and solidarity should guide the Union’s policy on visas, whilst also respecting, as is the case here, other debates on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the European Union and Canada. Only this way will we achieve a visa policy that is robust, rigorous, credible, supportive and unified. In the same manner, I am also aware of the importance of the Union’s foreign relationships, as well as those of the individual Member States; and for that reason, there is a need to find the balance between respect for the principles of reciprocity and solidarity and European trade relationships. This issue, as you are aware, has been debated for almost a year within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, via a proposal for the modification of Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. This would lead to the establishment of a list of the third countries whose citizens require visas to cross borders and a list of third countries whose citizens are exempt from this requirement. I am the rapporteur for this legislative initiative. The exact objective of this proposal is to provide the Union with an effective and realistic mechanism to resolve conflicts such as those currently being experienced by Romanian, Czech and Bulgarian citizens with Canada. We began the trialogue negotiation stage with the Council a week ago, but I have a strong mandate when it comes to reciprocity. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) is committed and calls for reciprocity. The stances of the three institutions and the Parliament are currently being aligned, but we are all aware of the urgency and the need to reach an agreement that satisfies the interests of all those concerned. Commissioner, I do not believe we can reach this agreement under the Danish Presidency. You are already aware that Parliament only says ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to an international agreement. I will say ‘no’ and will recommend that my political group says ‘no’ if Canada does not absolve the Czechs, Bulgarians and Romanians from the obligation, prior to the vote. Mr President, Mr Enciu makes a very solid and impeccable argument. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the European economic crisis is not strong enough to dissuade illegal immigrants who risk their lives at sea. Why is this? It is because the difficult situation that they find themselves in here does not compare to the conditions there. Besides that, there is the question of asylum, which transcends and has nothing to do with purely economic situations or situations of another nature. Asylum must always be equal to protection. I welcome Mr Iacolino’s initiative as it is very appropriate and I agree that it should be extended and reproduced every year, but in December. The phenomenon of heading out to sea in spring is not a new one – it is predictable – and, although it cannot be avoided, it can be alleviated. The Member States can control neither the Mediterranean nor the Atlantic front on their own. We need a timetable of solidarity, intelligence and diplomacy to do just three things: firstly, to try to stop them leaving at source; secondly, to patrol, save and help those who have managed to get out; and thirdly, to welcome those who have managed to arrive in decent and humanitarian conditions. There needs to be coordinated action between the Commission, the Member States, Frontex and third countries. These are not easy tasks – I am well aware of that – but we must not hold an untimely debate each year that has limited effectiveness. May I remind you that this discussion began in the parliamentary delegation sent to Sicily and Lampedusa almost six months ago. Then there is the question of the immigrant internment centres and the administrative detention centres, which must, without a shadow of a doubt, improve their reception and residence conditions, and the question of a legal, safe return and resettlement subject to scrupulous respect for human rights. As you can see, what I am telling you is not an issue that affects a particular country: it affects the whole of the EU and we must all make a commitment to providing an adequate response to this humanitarian challenge. We are late in saying this, but it is better to say it than not, and it is appropriate to do so on 9 May. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the interinstitutional balance is a reference that is bound by the Treaties and declared a fundamental political issue, both by Parliament and by the Commission and the Council. Mr President, I would like to denounce, as a repeated attitude, the lack of sensitivity on the part of any Commissioner of the European Commission who does not have availability in their schedule to respond to requests for interviews or meetings with MEPs. I will not mention names or specific cases today, but I think that Mr Barroso – who has always set an example of cooperation with Parliament and its MEPs – should send out an unequivocal signal to the College of Commissioners that meetings at the request of MEPs should be a priority and take place frequently. The reasons to protect cooperation and the much talked-about interinstitutional balance are unquestionable, not to mention the due respect that this House deserves. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Madam President, here is my opinion on the matter. As a response to the threats that the EU and the US must face, the Passenger Name Records (PNR) Agreement must be interpreted within the framework of the fight against transnational crime in all its dimensions. The strategy on the external dimension of Justice and Home Affairs, the EU strategy against terrorism and the Stockholm Programme all refer to the need to establish close cooperation with third countries through exchange of information. The data that are gathered under the PNR Agreement are used for purposes of preventing, detecting, suppressing and pursuing and for those purposes only. This new agreement provides great improvements by comparison with the 2007 agreement. The PUSH method is recognised as the mode of transfer, there is greater protection for data gathered, the number of supervisory authorities is increased and there are advances in data evaluation, not to mention the right of citizens to request correction or deletion of their PNR data, with the possibility of administrative or judicial redress. Moreover, the agreement respects the right to privacy in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Limitations may only be introduced where they are necessary and where they genuinely meet the general interest objectives recognised by the EU or protect the rights and freedoms of others. In these circumstances, we have two options: vote in favour of the agreement, and benefit from the improvements that have been introduced, or vote against. In the latter case, we would create great legal uncertainty that could lead to the signing of bilateral agreements, and to penalties and obligations being placed on airlines. We must commit and ensure a high level of effective protection of personal data, which means that any transfer of PNR data to the US must be done in a secure manner and in accordance with EU law and that passengers can exercise their rights in relation to the use of their data. In light of this situation then, Madam President, I am in favour of this agreement to combat terrorism and transnational crime.

Madam President, actually, I was referring to EU security strategy and the Stockholm Programme. You must not have been listening properly. The fact is, you use the language of Goethe and I use the language of Cervantes, and we have interpreters but, in spite of this, we cannot communicate with one another. Why? We cannot communicate because you speak of impressions and I speak of experiences. Based on my experiences, therefore, I am firmly in favour of the Passenger Name Records (PNR) in matters of security. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Coelho, thank you. We must highlight the advances represented by the use of biometric passports but we cannot deny the problems that exist in terms of implementation, especially the weaknesses detected in the passport-issuance chain. It would serve no purpose to equip border controls with great technical instruments if the system has a significant weakness in terms of procedures. In this context, if we take it into account, the balance between combating crime in the EU, respecting individual rights and guaranteeing free movement in the Schengen area takes on even greater importance. The forging of documents, organised crime and terrorism constitute direct attacks on our citizens but also on their personal rights and so we must reinforce the whole process of gathering and handling information of a personal nature. We must afford greater security to the travel document, establishing a reliable link between the passport and its holder. Accordingly, repeated fraudulent practice provides ample justification for the evaluation reports. Commissioner Malmström, we await the intermediate report scheduled for June, and the report scheduled for mid-2013, with great interest. We continue to back training for those responsible for managing the system, along with improvements to and interoperability of equipment and documents issued at each of the stages, without compromising, of course, either the information or the rights of the holder of the passport. Commissioner, being in a position to determine the scope of the issue of fingerprinting children, which, as has already been stated, is currently under study, is very important. Therefore, I place great value on the Portuguese Government’s decision to give reliability to the procedure. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, I echo the need to reach an overall agreement for the future that ensures the survival of the most deprived persons in the Union. We are talking about vulnerable, excluded, and poor people. The figures state that 13 million people in 19 Member States are experiencing poverty, 30 million people are undernourished, and 43 million people are at risk of experiencing food poverty, which shows the need to work together in order to ensure the programme continues after 2013. We must make use of the debate on the multiannual financial framework, as well as the debate on CAP reform, in order to ensure food aid and to overcome the legal obstacles. The Member States are going through a difficult period, but that is exactly why we now have to make greater efforts to protect those who are suffering the most due to the crisis: children, the sick, the unemployed, the elderly, and those 80 million people who are currently living below the poverty line in general. The Commission’s right to initiative is vital and essential. There are no disagreements in that respect in this Parliament, Mr President. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, I was and I am a supporter of Kosovo. During the Milosevic era I was in the refugee camps in Kukes, Elbasan, Stankovic, and so on. I welcomed many members of the Kosovo Liberation Army to my own city and offered them my solidarity. However, Mr President, Kosovo today has problems of corruption, control of the media, organised crime, and of government with room for improvement. In my opinion, Mr President, Kosovo does not today meet any of the necessary conditions either for being in the European Union or for being an independent country.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to heartily congratulate Mr Rui Tavares. This debate is a step towards the Union undertaking more humanitarian work, and providing greater international protection for refugees. We commend the improvement in reception conditions, the use of asylum procedures and the promotion of good and effective practices to ensure that people’s rights are protected in the international domain. Taking into account the fact that there were 301 000 asylum applications last year, of which 59 465 were accepted, we must streamline resettlement measures in the interest of maximising the efficiency of the services supplied. Five thousand resettlements in Europe is still very small in solidarity terms. I also went to Shusha. Far more Member States are going to have to involve themselves in resettlement, and therefore, we support the provision of additional financial support for those making the effort for the first time. There is also the need to provide additional financial support for the resettlement of people from specific geographical regions and nationalities once this has been decided as the most appropriate way of responding to their specific needs. The urgency and priority of Member State support should not be forgotten when it comes to children and women from specific risk groups, the victims of psychological, physical and sexual violence, as well as the victims of exploitation. One in every five asylum seekers is under the age of thirteen. Congratulations, Mr President, for this interinstitutional agreement. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Mr President, I understand that regulation when it comes to data protection can be based on internal security strategies. We cannot forget, however, that its extra-territorial impact could infringe on the rights of European citizens. What has arisen in connection with the Medicare Act, FISA, the Patriot Act and FATCA cases is more than mere concern. It appears that many of these measures stipulate that European financial entities, in the widest sense of the term, are obliged to provide all types of information, whether it concerns the title holder, their account types or the withholding of payments, among others. There is no prior agreement to justify obtaining this data, nor do the users know what the data will be used for or the amount of time for which it will be stored. It is therefore necessary to adopt measures and design a body of regulations and legislation to avoid infringement of the principle of territoriality. We should be able to maintain our relationships outside the Union, as well as our territory’s security, whilst totally respecting the rights of European citizens. The European Commission should show much more commitment and interest in this task. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, I reiterate: the food programme must be extended indefinitely. Our credibility is linked to the solidarity we show, and more so in a crisis period. Nobody can reasonably deny this, nor will they be able to. We know the disappointing and bitter figures. What poor person cares about the legal basis, or the ruling, or the common agricultural policy or the social dimension? Are we going to explain it to them? I do not want to and I cannot. We do not provide any justification for not giving, ladies and gentlemen, but we want to justify the fact that now we are taking away what we once gave them, and this is truly inexplicable. I ask for justice and I ask for compassion. We cannot reduce the EUR 500 million, because it is needed. For poor people, the situation is not a crisis. It is critical, and it affects the most vulnerable of them: old people, children, the sick, the homeless, those without power, without medicines and without food. React, ladies and gentlemen of the Council, react. I do not see any poor person sitting in the Council, Mr President. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, let me say it again: the food programme must be extended until 2020. The programme provides food aid to 13 million poor people in 19 Member States. Thirty million people in the Union suffer from malnutrition, 43 million are at risk of suffering from food poverty and 80 million live below the poverty threshold. What we are asking for – what I am asking for – is not charity. It is compassion and it is justice. We must maintain the level of financing at EUR 500 million. The poor are those who are suffering most from the crisis and much more so in winter: without a roof over their heads, in extreme cold, without power and without food. This affects the most vulnerable: children, old people and the sick. Solidarity within the Union cannot now be a dialectical resource, because that would make it a contemptible resource.

 Mr President, our energy dependence is a well-known fact. We import 60% of our gas and 83% of our oil. As for coal, our dependence amounts to 41%. Coal is the Union’s principal electricity-producing fuel, on a par with nuclear energy and gas. If we limit our mining capacity, we will simply have to import it from countries that do not have our social or environmental standards. In its energy strategy for 2050, the Commission should review the current framework of aid provision to coal mining. There is scope for improvement of the new legislation as regards the time limit for mine closure or the requirement to return the aid received in order to continue in operation. Our energy dependency is one more of our external weaknesses and, in the current crisis, we will pay the price for it sooner rather than later. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, it is regrettable that the European Union should abandon thousands of refugees to their fate on account of a mere institutional disagreement, and I am pointing my finger at the Council. The debate on the legislative procedure to choose priority regions has gone to absurd extremes, breaking the principle of solidarity which inspires the Union and the European Refugee Fund. The issue is not whether we should use a procedure based partially on codecision, as proposed by the Council, or the ordinary legislative procedure proposed by this House. The really important matter is to help those who most need it and to ensure the priority regions are chosen promptly so that the ultimate aim of helping persecuted and deprived people can be achieved. If this choice is considered a delegated act, then let us accept the comitology procedure; if not, let us agree once and for all on the mechanism through which the choice is to be made. I have visited many refugee camps, the last one of them in July …  (The President cut off the speaker) Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Madam President, I fully support the proposal for a directive; it is a real breakthrough. Furthermore, Ms Angelilli’s commitment to the cause of child protection is one of the most noble objectives that a parliamentarian can undertake. Children are weak and vulnerable and therefore deserve the highest level of protection. Sexual abuse of children must be prevented with new legislative measures and punished harshly under criminal law. So-called sex tourism and child pornography are forms of exploitation which should be a matter of priority for law enforcement, including international agreements on the matter. In my opinion, all agreements with third countries on free trade and development aid must include a child protection clause. We must also focus our serious concerns on the child indoctrination that occurs in some countries suffering structural poverty, where they hand over many children, the offspring of polygamous unions, to apparently religious schools to avoid lack of food and hunger. Child assassins, child soldiers and child drug runners are among the most heinous forms of exploitation, a widespread phenomenon on two continents which has irreversible social repercussions. Programmes to rescue child victims of forced prostitution must be a political and social priority of the European Union. Line 11600 must have the commitment and unwavering support of all Member States. Madam President, I appreciate and applaud the effort and commitment of the Council, but I particularly applaud the commitment of Ms Malmström and Ms Angelilli.

 Mr President, I congratulate Ms Lambert and the shadow rapporteurs on the impetus given to this report, without which there would have been no agreement with the Council. How to go about deciding who qualifies as a family member was a key factor for my group. This needs to be defined properly to prevent abuse of the Community system for international protection. The distinction between beneficiaries of asylum and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection is essential when agreeing on who has what rights. Subsidiary protection is more limited in time than asylum, the former status providing entitlement to a shorter residence permit (one year) and the latter to a longer residence permit (three years), although both cases can be reviewed if the threat to the beneficiaries remains. The plan to remove the distinction between the two forms of protection was originally rejected by my group and by the Council, which is why we must now congratulate ourselves on the agreement reached with the rapporteur. The need to recognise the rights that legitimately belong to those that are persecuted is consistent with measures to prevent fraudulent use of the European system for international protection. We must also welcome the fact that the report sets out the need for Member States and their authorities to safeguard the best interests of minors and to extend protection to unaccompanied minors, paying particular attention to their safety, well-being and development, as well as the principle of family unity. Lastly, Mr President, the inclusion of references to persecution by customs or traditions, resulting in genital mutilation, forced abortion or forced sterilisation is a remarkable and outstanding achievement.

Mr President, this is a debate that has already taken place, but I shall make some comments with reference to new scenarios. Following the failed attack on a plane on 25 December 2009, more effective protection and detection technology had to be sought. Scanners at airports increase levels of security but they present problems, especially in relation to the protection of human rights. The Council and the Commission accepted Mr de Grandes Pascual’s proposal that security scanners should not use technology based on ionising radiation. Now it must be decided whether the exploration mechanism will use real passenger images or stick images, which are the most appropriate option in order to protect the intimacy, privacy, health and dignity of passengers. However, stick figures present a problem in terms of free competition since today, only one company has that technology. Although other companies in the sector have announced that they can introduce the algorithms needed in order to adapt the scanners, the machine configuration time could work against them. Therefore, the Commission should examine the timeframe for implementing the rules relating to body scanners, avoiding a possible monopoly situation and supporting decisively Parliament’s report and the report of Mr de Grandes Pascual, which are one and the same thing. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, Ms Meissner, thank you very much for your interesting question. Strictly speaking, in order to avoid what you are unhappy about and what I, too, am unhappy about, I would say and repeat that what the Commission should do is examine the timeframe for the implementation of rules relating to body scanners very carefully. That way, everyone will be able to compete on equal terms but in line with what has been said by Parliament and in Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, let us indeed talk about solidarity and the poor. In the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting, a blocking minority opposed the amendment to the regulation governing food aid to the most disadvantaged. Mr Sawicki has already explained their reasons. However, the Council should be reminded that 60% of the funds is needed to feed the 79 million people in Europe who live below the poverty line. Those funds are provided by national, regional and local governments, and by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Up until last April, the European Union contributed 40%. The position taken by the blocking minority would lead to a drastic reduction in aid for next year, and a complete abolition by 2013. We condemn this. I would like to thank the Polish Presidency and the Commission for their determination to continue the programme, and I emphatically condemn the position of those Member States that formed a blocking minority. I ask those Member States: where is your compassion? Have you even heard of compassion? I urge Mr Cioloş and Mr Sawicki not to give up, because no court can go against the law of God, or against compassion. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 and other organisations are doing a tremendous job. Tunisia has shown solidarity with displaced persons and refugees from Libya. Tunisians have welcomed 90 000 Libyans into their own homes. However, beyond this emergency nobody is taking care of those in Sousse. There is a major difference between the Europe that donates and the Europe that does not receive. Our solidarity extends to other countries, but we do not show solidarity within our borders. We now need to make an impassioned plea for resettlement, so that the 4 000 refugees can be received on European soil. This is neither complicated nor expensive. There has been a show of commitment, as the Commissioner said, but there needs to be something more than good will and statements of intent. We urgently need to resettle those groups who are suffering so much hardship in Sousse and who, in Europe, could find hope for their shattered lives. Many times and in desperate voices they asked Europe not to abandon them. Others told us their child had lost 10 kilos and was malnourished and in need of medical attention, but they had nowhere to go. Resettlement offers have so far totalled – or would total, if they were carried out – 718, but that still leaves 3 707 people. Madam President, I strongly call on the Council and the Commission to show commitment in order to end this serious humanitarian crisis as soon as possible. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the European Union is Taiwan’s fifth largest trading partner, whereas for the Union, this Asian island ranks fourteenth among its trading partners. Trade between the two parties has increased by 800% in the last decades, with the annual trade volume currently standing at EUR 27.5 billion. Last year alone, trade between the Union and Taiwan grew by 39%. This growth has been boosted by measures such as visa exemption, introduced via the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. In spite of this and the fact that the Europe 2020 strategy stresses that the Union needs to step up its trade links with growing and emerging markets, our relations with Taiwan have not reached their full development as far as trade is concerned. It is therefore necessary to bring in new measures to remove the obstacles – including tariffs, trade prohibitions, taxes and duties on luxury products – which currently prevent us from unlocking the full potential of trade with Taiwan. This would be a decisive step towards a dynamic, ambitious free trade agreement, which I support. A free trade agreement is necessary and it will benefit the parties involved. Good trade dialogue is not enough, Commissioner. We need to go much further. Furthermore, no one has the right to veto our relations. The ties between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China are getting stronger every day, and we, the European Union, have sovereignty to decide, without anyone’s interference, who we negotiate our free trade agreements with.

 Madam President, on 29 June 2011 a group of Taliban terrorists murdered Antonio Planas in Kabul, a Spanish national like myself, aged 49, married and the father of a young girl. Until a few days ago, certain Spanish nationals who were victims of terrorist attacks outside of the European Union territory could not have access to protection and compensation mechanisms. On 23 June 2011, however, the legislation was amended to benefit terrorist victims and their relatives, irrespective of the country where the attack took place. The threat is not limited to a given territory and it must be prevented at national, EU and international level, strengthening cooperation with third countries. The defence of terrorist victims and their rights should be a priority policy in the Union, and the institutions should encourage their public recognition. Thus, we welcome the actions proposed by the Commission, although more concrete instruments to help the victims of terror are still needed. The family of Antonio Planas needs our help, and we urge the institutions concerned to provide it. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, corruption costs the European Union the same amount as its annual budget. Four out of every five citizens consider corruption to be one of the biggest problems for Member States. On 6 June 2011, the Commission published the package of measures aimed at fighting corruption. That is commendable. These measures include the introduction of updated EU rules on public procurement, rules on auditing and regulatory monitoring of EU companies, development of a biannual report that identifies corruption trends, measures relating to the confiscation of criminal assets, a strategy to improve research on financial crime, and the action plan for improving statistics on corruption offences. These proposals are warmly welcomed. Nevertheless, we need to show caution with regard to Member States’ individual compliance with implementation, especially when we consider the data provided by the report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to which 12 out of the 27 EU Member States have no anti-corruption rules or have minimal, insufficient standards. That is why we have doubts about the Commission’s real capacity – despite its best intentions – to implement the measures it has proposed; it therefore needs to go further, guaranteeing that all the Member States make a real commitment to combating corruption, for this is of great necessity, above and beyond expert groups, political will or generalities. We call for specific, legally-binding actions. That is what we are asking for. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Madam President, I offer my sincere congratulations to Mr Busuttil, to the Commission and to the Council. The creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is one of the Union’s greatest achievements, enabling almost 500 million people to move freely within its territory. The removal of internal borders meant that the peripheral countries were obliged to strengthen their border controls, a function which, as you will recall, falls within the exclusive competence of the countries concerned. The land-locked countries benefit from the free area, but occasionally they forget that this situation is largely due to the effort made by Member States with external boundaries, an effort which is bound to increase in situations where there is a migration crisis. To an ever-increasing extent, these situations require the intervention of Frontex. However, the agency’s ability to react is limited as it lacks the necessary resources. This lack of resources is due in large part to the lack of real commitment on the part of certain Member States. Thus, it was necessary and appropriate to strengthen the Frontex Regulation, clearly defining the agency’s role and providing the legal instruments enabling it to be equipped with the necessary means and resources needed to carry out its goals in full accordance with fundamental rights. The provision of economic, material and human resources cannot depend on the good will of only some Member States, since solidarity should be binding and general. Frontex should also coordinate its activities with Europol and Eurojust to fight organised crime. Cooperation with the European Asylum Support Office is an essential element in ensuring access to international protection. The creation of a system of border guards is an interesting proposal which may be brought about if it is implemented through the compulsory solidarity clause. In short, approval of the proposed regulation will make it possible to manage migratory flows better, fight the mafias more effectively and improve the common asylum system.

 Mr President, I reject this report as inappropriate, mistaken, misinformed, untimely and subjective. The fight against terrorism is very necessary and it must be efficient, act as a deterrent and have a preventative effect too. Although it must be valued, its costs should never be evaluated in economic terms. How many euros does a life cost? How many euros do three thousand lives cost? I support democratic judges and police officers and I trust in them and I believe in our democratic vitality to correct the abuses of power that could occur. I would also cite psalm 46 in solidarity: ‘Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea’. I share the reflected absence too; it is present in my heart and in my speeches as are all the victims: those of Madrid, London, Marrakech, Casablanca and Bali, all of them. No, Mr President, this own-initiative report is a bad initiative. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Madam President, the reality: 30 million people are malnourished and 79 million people live in poverty; the tragedy: a court decision; the shame: that we allow this. The European Parliament must make its unanimous and powerful voice heard. This is an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to the weakest people. We must make a distinction between selfish rhetoric and real solidarity. We, Madam President, must create the momentum so that the Council allows us to do away with the blocking minority. We are wholeheartedly calling for the solidarity – agreed to yesterday in this House – of the President-in-Office of the Council, of the Polish Presidency. Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament cannot forsake millions of people, the poorest of the poor, who suffer the most acute effects of the crisis. We are talking about a budget going from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million, which is a decrease of 63%. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, within an hour, Parliament must clearly declare that, regardless of the outcome of the court decision, the essence of the EU, which is solidarity, is present here, in this House, the house of the people and of the European peoples.

Mr President, Schengen is a milestone in the construction of the area of liberty, security and justice. Freedom of movement is, moreover, a fundamental pillar of the EU, enshrined in Article 45 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights and it must be preserved and protected. We need more Europe, not less Europe. Limiting the Schengen agreement is not the solution. What we must do is overcome, once and for all, the reluctance of some Member States to make advances in the sphere of immigration. The EU has the means to do it but the political will is lacking. We can and must reinforce external border control mechanisms, improve and equip the capabilities and means of Frontex, promote the creation and implementation of Eurosur, drive the implementation of the second generation Schengen Information System and the Visa Information System, foster cooperation and the exchange of information between border, police, judicial and customs services, and advance determinedly towards the construction of a common policy on matters of immigration, asylum and visas that gives special consideration to cooperation agreements with third countries. The performance of the Member States in the sphere of immigration should be inspired by Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, helping in solidarity those who, by virtue of their geographic position, are obliged to deal with extraordinary flows of irregular immigrants or those seeking international protection. The responsibility must be shared in this regard, Mr President. I am bound to note that the reintroduction of border controls and internal controls for circumstances not provided for in Articles 23, 24 and 25 of the Schengen Borders Code is illegal and seriously violates the provisions of Article 77 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The mechanism for evaluation by a Community court, proposed by the Commission, should be the only instrument and should be extraordinary and temporary. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very rigorous work. The objective of this report is to maintain a high level of security in airports while safeguarding citizens’ fundamental rights. Air transport is a target for terrorist attacks, and it is therefore necessary to strengthen security in order to protect people, infrastructure, cargo and mail. In that respect, security scanners in airports are a useful tool. Their inclusion among screening methods used to detect banned or dangerous items is therefore necessary. However, it is vital for a thorough evaluation to be carried out in advance, in order to determine the least harmful technology and the level of non-cumulative emissions that is acceptable for public health. It is also important that, with this technology, the protection of personal data is guaranteed and the dignity of the individual being screened is preserved. I would like to point out that Member States can implement stricter security measures than those required by European legislation, thus having the capacity to introduce scanners in airports under their jurisdiction. The EU institutions therefore need to lay down common rules of procedure with regard to detection performance criteria and tools. Information relating to the screening procedure is a vital element of this tool. Airport personnel must receive proper training in order to provide passengers with adequate information on screening safety, voluntary participation, alternatives and the deletion of images. To conclude, I would like to emphasise that any passenger’s decision to refuse screening does not make them a suspect, and that the selection criteria for being scanned will be based exclusively on security reasons and not on any other grounds, such as race or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religion, and so on. Having nothing further to add, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Madam President, I support Mr Coelho’s thorough work and I congratulate him on his negotiating capacity, in Parliament and at first reading. In terms of the need to create a new agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems, we should remember that the Commission itself has declared that it cannot assume the responsibility for managing large databases, and that creating a merely executive agency would not in any case give Parliament control, because it would still be embedded in the structure of the European Commission. Considering the important work being entrusted to the new agency and the need for this work to be scrutinised by Parliament, however, the new body should take the form of a European agency with its own legal status. Its objectives should be clearly defined, these being operational management of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS) and Eurodac. It could also take responsibility for the preparation, development and operational management of other large-scale information systems. However, it should be noted that this must in all cases be done with the right legal instruments. The agency will not under any circumstances be able to take political decisions, such as creating new information systems or decisions on interoperability with different systems. The important role that the agency is to play means it must have a reinforced administrative structure that will ensure data integrity and protection, and for this reason it is essential that it incorporate a post of data security manager and an independent data protection body, thereby complying with the legal provisions contained in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In conclusion, Mr Coelho, I am very much in agreement with your three initial points, and with the seven points made by Parliament on making a strong commitment to reaching an EU solution and taking a firm stand against any limitation of the Schengen Area.

 Mr President, 30 million people in the European Union suffer from malnutrition and a further 79 million live below the poverty threshold. Most of them depend on food aid provided primarily by food banks. Some 40% of the funds needed to provide this food come from contributions made by the Union, through the European Scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union. This scheme has been implemented to date in accordance with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 983/2008 establishing aid for the purchase of cereals, skimmed milk powder and rice. The Regulation was partially revoked in April by the General Court of the European Union, with the budget for food aid being reduced from EUR 500 million to EUR 133 million. The integration of the European Union has historically been based on the principle of solidarity. This is why, Mr President, we urge the new Polish Presidency and the European Parliament, now more than ever, to show their commitment to helping the most deprived, and to re-establishing the budget appropriation that is currently so limited. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, in my view, the arrest warrant is a fundamental tool in the fight against organised crime, terrorism and other forms of crime. It is a proven tool and, according to the Decision, the cornerstone of cooperation and the first concrete example of the principal of mutual recognition in the sphere of criminal law. Of course it is a very useful tool but we must not fail to mention that it also has weaknesses. The weaknesses are perfectly identified, as Commissioner Reding has also said, not only in the Commission’s report of April 2011, but also in its reports of 2005 and 2006. Those weaknesses, which stem fundamentally from two basic and essential premises, can and, naturally, must be corrected. The arrest warrant has two components: issue and refusal or surrender, as appropriate. The figures show that it is a useful tool, with 54 000 arrest warrants having been issued and 12 000 executed. Turning to the question of what corrections need to be made, what we need are greater and better procedural guarantees around issue, refusal and surrender. The issue of proportionality or the lack thereof in the use of the arrest warrant is critical, a key issue. For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to hear Commissioner Reding say that Member States will be required to exercise a proportionality test and to take care not to issue arrest warrants for minor offences. Incidentally, Mr President, during the course of these questions, one particular item has slipped in, namely, that every arrest warrant costs the Public Treasury EUR 25 000. This is something that was said by an Irish judge. I say to that judge that I do not believe it and that he should demonstrate on what basis such a calculation was made. Consequently, I believe that the arrest warrant should continue in force in revitalised form, with better procedural guarantees. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
No, Mr Dartmouth. I believe that the European Arrest Warrant is a more useful and more versatile tool for combating all the forms of crime to which we have referred. Commissioner Reding has already told you, and I emphasise the fact, that an extradition order can take up to a year whereas a European Arrest Warrant, on the other hand, must be substantiated within 40 days. That is why I believe that the latter is a much more versatile and much more useful procedure for fighting crime, wrongdoing and terrorism. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Coelho, and I do this because his work is consistently rigorous. I now add that we must help Bulgaria and Romania. I trust Bulgaria and Romania. They have worked well and hard and they should receive what is theirs by right – this is no gift. The Presidency-in-office of the Council and the Commissioner, Mrs Malmström, have both stated that these two countries comply with the technical and legal requirements, and I add my voice to theirs. I believe we should not consider any criteria other than the strictly technical and legal. These criteria essentially number five. They comply with the following: they comply with the data protection requirements, they comply with the Schengen Information System (SIS), they comply with police cooperation, they comply with the issue of visas and they comply with the control of external borders by air, sea and land. Strictly speaking, they also comply with the SIS and with the Supplementary Information Request at the National Entry (SIRENE). In view of all this, this House should send an unequivocally strong message to the Council and, notably, to the permanent representations of five countries that I shall refrain from mentioning but which are in the minds of all of us here today. I do believe, ladies and gentlemen, that in including Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area, which comprises more than four hundred million human beings, we are adding, not subtracting; we are building a stronger Europe. Furthermore, we should avoid double standards. Nor should we set conditions for Romania and Bulgaria that we do not ask of the other Member States in order to form part of this area of freedom. Thus, to end my speech, I fervently express my wish for a strong, majority-endorsed message to be sent from this House to the Council. Congratulations once again, Mr Coelho, and congratulations to Romania and Bulgaria. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to speak and to use this debate to talk about a fundamental issue: the emergency. They cannot cope alone. The root of this problem is, as everybody knows, in the unstable situations in Tunisia and Egypt, and the war in Libya. However, there is no limit to how long it will last: unfortunately, it will last a worrying length of time. We therefore need to decide how we can use our common policies to manage the emergency, because they cannot cope alone. In my opinion, Madam President, Commissioner, solidarity with the victims and solidarity with the host states and regions must be our priority. We have instruments that we are not using properly. We have four funds. Mrs Malmström told us clearly and briskly about sums that strike me as ridiculous. She spoke of EUR 30 million, EUR 25 million on request, etc. However, our four funds, the Refugee Fund, the Return Fund, the External Borders Fund and the Integration Fund, total almost EUR 3 billion within the scope of the financial perspectives. Mrs Malmström, it seems to me that these funds should be used for emergency situations, because we need to have the ability to use them and modify them. Our limitations in terms of collaboration and solidarity are symbolised by the fragility that the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union has demonstrated with the Hermes Operation. The arrival of increasing numbers of people fleeing the war and fleeing from desperation highlight how limited this capacity is. They cannot cope alone. Who can cope? The European Union has the necessary solidarity to meet the requirements of this emergency in real time. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I think nobody will be surprised to hear me say again that solidarity with refugees and displaced persons should constitute a fundamental element of EU policy in the areas of asylum and immigration. However, it is not just a question of having solidarity with those coming from weak and disadvantaged societies, but also with the Member States that, because of their geographic location, their culture or their language, suffer greater pressure in this regard. While numbers of applications for protection and of immigrants arriving are low in some countries, there are many other  countries that are unable to tackle on their own the pressure their borders are subjected to on a daily basis. Following Parliament’s adoption of the reports relating to the Commission communication on the Union resettlement programme and the modification of the European Refugee Fund in May 2010, we are still waiting for the Council to complete the codecision procedure. The pilot projects currently being undertaken in 10 Member States are a drop in an ocean, which we still have to cross. The southern Member States are subjected to great pressure, particularly since the popular movements in Egypt and Tunisia, and the war in Libya, began. Lampedusa, with a population of 5 000, has received almost 6 000 immigrants since the conflicts started. The aforementioned pilot projects are completely insufficient and will hardly do anything to relieve the pressure that is already affecting Italy and Malta, but will affect other Mediterranean countries in the near future. The Union as a whole must help these countries. It is imperative that the Council overcome the obstacles currently preventing the full implementation of a European resettlement programme and defeat the minorities blocking it. Massive population displacements and migrations affect the Union as a whole and not just a part of it. I am finishing, Mr President. Last week I called for a European Parliament presence on Libya’s borders and I repeat that call now. It is not enough for 10 fellow Members to have spent last week in Egypt: we must have the capacity to evaluate the humanitarian situation ourselves. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, there are thousands of refugees and thousands of displaced people. The solution to this emergency is evacuation. What is needed is transport. As Mr Guterres said, these people do not want to come to the European Union; they want to go back home. There are 2 million immigrants, 1 million Egyptians and 80 000 Bangladeshis. We must focus on the weakest of the weak: Eritreans, Somalis, the sub-Saharan Africans mistaken for mercenaries and Palestinians. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) says it needs USD 160 million over three months for water, medicines, food and transport. We expect a resounding response from the Union on Friday. Gaddafi cannot escape international criminal justice: mass attacks on his people constitute crimes against humanity. Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is already taking action. Mr President, the European Parliament must be involved. We are also a democratic instrument for applying pressure and informing the free world. We need a mandate from this Chamber for a delegation of Parliament in the UNHCR, Red Cross and Red Crescent refugee camps. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, in 2012, we urgently need a common asylum policy. The report presented by the Commission on 8 September highlights the numerous obstacles that the Member States encounter when seeking to achieve the objectives of Directive 2005/85/EC. Asylum seekers’ right to legal aid applies at different levels. Many Member States invoke the directive in providing legal assistance at the appeal stage, while others grant that right during both the application process and at second instance. Some Member States require proof of merit in order to decide whether or not free legal assistance is granted at the appeal stage. In the majority of cases, there are major differences regarding the deadlines for appealing, while the applicability of the automatic suspension of the effects of refusals also presents difficulties, as it only applies in six Member States. These differences demonstrate that the directive must be reviewed. In reviewing it, the Commission stresses the need to focus efforts on the initial phase of the procedure, in order to be more effective in differentiating which people have a right to protection. According to the Commission, this measure will help to save significant interpreting and legal assistance costs at second instance. However, the proposal is not accompanied by a detailed study of what the interpreting and legal assistance costs would be at first instance, nor of the costs that the Member States actually incur currently when applying the European legislation. For that reason, the Commission needs to provide information as to the actual costs relating to its proposal to focus efforts, and I do not think that the refusal that I have just heard from the Commission is acceptable. I sincerely believe that this is unacceptable and that it needs to be reconsidered or qualified. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, international adoption that is inspired by the principles of prevalence of the interests of the child and respect for his fundamental rights is an appropriate means of finding a family for children for whom a family cannot be found in their country of origin. People trafficking, sexual exploitation and work slavery are a terrible reality affecting hundreds of millions of minors. Let us look at some of the statistics: there are more than 145 million abandoned children in the world; in Russia alone, more than 600 000 live on the streets; since 1980, more than 2 million children have died in armed conflicts; more than 600 million children live in extreme poverty; more than 5 million die every year; more than 130 million children in developed countries grow up without access to a basic education due to their poverty, and 60% of them are girls; 7 million children worldwide are subject to sexual slavery. For all these reasons, we must foster mechanisms to promote an international adoption instrument inspired by protecting children, harmonising the different requirements and procedures laid down in the legislation of the Member States, in particular, applying Article 21 of the European Charter of Children’s Rights and taking into consideration Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Madam President, Commissioner, trafficking in human beings is a harsh reality in the EU. Sexual exploitation is the main objective of the mafias that traffic human beings, followed by forced labour, domestic service, forced marriages, exploitation of children for begging, illegal adoption and the removal of organs, which are other scourges and aspects of the problem. The new powers that Article 63 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives Parliament must be used in order to strengthen EU legislation in this field. This includes, among many other issues, calling for the classification of crimes that are still not covered by some European criminal legislation. We need to strengthen our legislation to protect victims of trafficking from two perspectives: prevention and protection, and integration into society and the labour market. We need to establish specific measures to protect minors; to criminalise traffickers and middlemen; to establish measures to discourage demand and confiscate the proceeds of the crime; to establish the criminal responsibility of any legal persons that take part in any phase of trafficking; to step up employment inspection and penalties for the exploitation of employees and illegal hiring of irregular immigrants; to strengthen the role of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders and of the immigration liaison officers in detecting the channels used by traffickers and their modus operandi
; and finally, strengthening the role of the joint investigation teams of the European Police Office (Europol) in combating the mafias. I would like to conclude by adding that the figure of the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator could make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives that I have mentioned, although his powers and capacities must be clearly defined in order to prevent actions from being duplicated or interference with the functions entrusted to Europol.

Mr President, the increase in asylum applications on behalf of citizens of Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia requires measures protecting the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. Visas are an instrument included in the framework of immigration policies; their purpose is to legalise the entry and temporary stay in a country where the applicant is neither a non-national nor a resident. Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 provides for an evaluation mechanism for visa extension, in which certain requirements in relation to illegal immigration, public order and security, the Union’s external relations, territorial cohesion and the principle of reciprocity must be fulfilled. This mechanism could also function in the opposite direction. Asylum, on the other hand, is an instrument of protection that cannot be used incorrectly. It should be pointed out that the purpose of the European Union’s common policy in this area is to preserve the integrity of asylum as an instrument of protection for the persecuted, prioritising the principles of the Geneva Convention and the New York Protocol, applying common criteria for the identification of people who genuinely require international protection and a guaranteed common minimum level of benefits in all Member States for the welfare of those people. Asylum is therefore an instrument of humanitarianism and solidarity and, hence, exclusive in its purpose and nature. This is why it is important that the European Union reacts and helps the Serbian and Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonian authorities to adopt sufficient measures regarding the requirements that must be fulfilled to benefit from refugee status or subsidiary protection status, thereby avoiding improper or fraudulent use of them.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members, Mrs Guillaume, Mr Ilchev, Mrs Keller, Mrs Wikström and Mr Tavares. The support they have given me has improved this report. I would specifically like to draw the Council’s and the Commission’s attention to the terminology. From my point of view, it would be more appropriate if we used the term ‘irregular immigration’. Up to now, clandestine immigration has been referred to as ‘illegal immigration’ in all the legislative instruments the EU has enacted. Although it is true that in some Member States, an irregular entry or stay constitutes a crime and in others, the term ‘irregular’ has no legal or semantic significance, in many other Member States, an irregular entry or stay does not constitute an unlawful act, which is why we should not generally criminalise these activities. For this reason, in the explanatory statement of the report, it is asked that the institutions revise the terminology that is used, insisting on the need to find a more precise and appropriate definition for the phenomenon of clandestine immigration. Moving on to the substance of this issue, the immigration liaison officers’ network was created by Council Regulation (EC) No 377/2004. This instrument states that the liaison officers will be representatives of a Member State posted abroad by the immigration service or other appropriate authority with the aim of establishing and maintaining contact with the authorities of the host country, aiming to contribute to the prevention and combat of clandestine immigration, the repatriation of irregular immigrants and the management of legal immigration. Since the enactment of the regulation, the Frontex Agency has been established, whose mission is to coordinate operational cooperation between Member States in the area of external border management; assist the Member States in the training of national border guards; carry out risk analyses; monitor the development of external border control and surveillance research; assist Member States in circumstances that require increased technical and operational assistance at external borders and provide them with the necessary support in the organising of joint return operations. It is evident that the important mission entrusted to Frontex could be achieved in a more efficient way if they could draw upon the knowledge and experience of the immigration liaison officers’ network, especially if we take into account the fact that the European Agency does not have offices or representatives outside EU territory. The proposed amendment to Regulation (EC) No 337/2004 aims to harness the knowledge and experience of the immigration officials for Frontex and vice versa, which was not included in the original regulation. Furthermore, the proposed amendment suggests accessing the information obtained by the liaison officers’ network through ICONet, which is a secure information and coordination network for the immigration management services of Member States, accessing the External Borders Fund to promote the creation of liaison officers’ networks and, finally, facilitating a mechanism for the presentation of reports on the activity of the network and the designation of named regions of interest in the area of immigration. The relevant legal bases of the proposal are Article 63(3)(b) and Article 66 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. I will stop there, Madam President, and will make further observations in the second round. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your words, and also for your commitment. I would once again like to express my admiration for the way that you are managing the portfolio with which you have been entrusted. There have been 18 speeches this afternoon, and the majority groups have supported this report. I would therefore like to reiterate my deep and heartfelt gratitude, because they have participated actively, enriching and amending substantive issues that should be included and are now included. I am essentially referring to the human rights chapter, the European Asylum Support Office and the role of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Obviously, in such a broad and diverse Chamber, we are not obliged to agree with one another, which is why the efforts that we have all made to reach a very broad consensus are particularly significant. Ladies and gentlemen, from a centre-right and Christian Democrat position, I am indeed saying that I am unequivocally in favour of the expression ‘irregular’, and that I reject the expression ‘illegal’, as legally, semantically and ethically inappropriate. Thank you very much to all my fellow Members for their support, and also for their speeches, including the dissenting ones. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Madam President, in order to mitigate the social and energy impact and to ensure secure energy reserves, we have tabled three amendments in plenary with the following aims: firstly, for the overall volume of aid per year to diminish, but with no percentage limit or limit per business. In this respect, we are grateful for Mr Langen’s position regarding removing fixed references and each Member State being able to decide according to their interests. The second aim is for aid to cover exceptional costs to be extended to 2030. Such proposals will help to alleviate the energy dependency of numerous EU countries, including Spain. They would ensure the continuation of indigenous production and the preservation of thousands of jobs on which significant regions of Spain and of Europe as a whole are largely dependent.

Mr President, I would like to make an announcement to the House. The Taiwanese Government has informed the Council, via the permanent representations, Parliament and the Commission, that from today, 11 November, it is establishing visa exemptions for Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania. Consequently, all 27 EU countries can enter Taiwanese territory without a visa. When the House votes in a moment, Mr President, I will take the opportunity to congratulate all the political groups for the support that they have given to this matter, as well as the Taiwanese people, the Taiwanese authorities, and their extremely strong diplomatic team. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Madam President, freedom and security are essential elements for the implementation of any current democratic legal structure, in which freedom uses security as the most valued tool for protection. The transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to third countries is an essential element of the transnational fight against terrorism and organised crime. It should be based on scrupulous compliance with EU rules on the protection of personal data, as laid down in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. For this reason, we must welcome the communication from the Commission on the global approach to transfers of PNR data to third countries and its recommendations that the Council authorises the opening of negotiations in this area with Australia, Canada and the United States, as both instruments take up Parliament’s concerns regarding security, defending fundamental rights and protecting personal data. However, it should be pointed out that PNR data cannot be used for profiling, which is why the Commission sought to clarify – in my view, successfully – the differences between the expressions ‘risk assessment’ and the aforementioned profiling. Moreover, the Commissioner said that checking will be done by humans rather than being automated. Well, we will see what happens. Madam President, we need a single, general, legally binding agreement to protect personal data. This top-level agreement must be implemented through sectoral agreements in order to combat terror and organised crime. As regards the need, Madam President, it is obvious. As regards proportionality, it must, in all cases, be an inalienable requirement. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
rapporteur.

Commissioner, I would also like to send my regards to your excellent team. Ladies and gentlemen, Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the Union’s external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 that we are discussing today has three objectives: transferring Taiwan to the positive list, transferring other third countries or territories – Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau – to the positive list and the situation of the Northern Mariana Islands. The situation of the Northern Mariana Islands does not pose any problems, as its inhabitants are, as you are aware, US citizens.  With regard to the requests to transfer the third countries that I listed, the Commission finds no justification for removing the visa requirement, and neither do we. In the case of Taiwan, this Asian island has experienced commendable democratic, social and economic development. Democratic institutions have been firmly established since 1996, when the first direct presidential elections were held. The President is the Head of the Government, and is elected by the people of Taiwan via universal suffrage for a four-year term. Legislative power currently lies with the Legislative Yuan, which has 113 members. Economically, Taiwan’s income per head of population is one of the highest in the world at USD 30 100, in July 2010, unemployment stood at 5.2%, way below the European average, which was 10.1% in the same month. During the first quarter of 2010, economic growth hit 13.27%, whilst during the first half of 2010, the balance of trade surplus stood at USD 12.1 billion. Figures published by the International Monetary Fund in 2009 placed Taiwan’s economy 25th in the world, with a gross national product of USD 379 billion. It should be pointed out that in 1950, Taiwan was poorer than Ghana, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Until 1960, it was more reliant on commodities exports than countries like Kenya, South Africa and Lebanon. Today, however, products manufactured in Taiwan account for more than 97% of the country’s exports. All this has meant that Taiwan’s net migration rate stands at just 0.15%. For this reason, it is very unlikely that we will have to deal with any illegal immigrants from Taiwan. According to data supplied by the Commission, in 2006-2008, only 45 illegal immigrants throughout the entire European Union were found to have come from Taiwan. As far as the security of travel documents is concerned, I would like to point out that Taiwanese electronic passports meet all the anti-counterfeiting standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The situation of dispersed Taiwanese should be looked at closely, as even if they have passports issued by the authorities, they need prior authorisation to enter Taiwan. For this reason, it would seem logical for the European Union to maintain a similar approach regarding those people, as my report proposes. Currently, Taiwan does not require visas from the majority of the Member States, except for Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria. The Taiwanese authorities have nevertheless undertaken to ensure that a visa waiver is in place for nationals of those countries by 11 November, in other words, tomorrow. This is a formal commitment of which the Presidency of the Council, the European Commission and Parliament have been notified, along with the permanent representations of the countries concerned. For this reason, Mr President, and for other reasons which I shall mention in my second speech, it is worth us granting the visa exemption to Taiwan, as the United Kingdom and Ireland did last year.

rapporteur.

Mr President, noblesse oblige
, so I would like to start by saying that I am infinitely grateful for the support that all fellow Members representing their political groups have given to the report that I have had the honour to present to the House. I would also like to thank you for supporting my work. It would not, however, be fair if I did not say that the person mainly responsible is Commissioner Malmström, whose support, energy and excellent team have made it possible to drive forward this action, which I would describe as an act of justice. There is nothing more to be said, Mr President, except to add that I would also like to congratulate the people of Taiwan, the Taiwanese authorities and, of course, the excellent team of diplomats that Taiwan has in the world, particularly in Brussels.

Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Fajon on producing a report that involved so much commitment in such a determined way. I would also like to congratulate my colleague and friend, Mrs Corazza Bildt, for her determination and passion in taking on the commitment of visa exemptions for Bosnia and Herzegovina and for Albania, two countries that desperately need them. Like you, I, too, was in Sarajevo and Mostar during the war, and I too witnessed Milosevic’s mass population displacements and the solidarity of the Albanians. That is why I am expressing my joy here today, Mr President, because, happily, justice is being done. Since the Salonica Summit in June 2003, when the European Union at last took the welcome step of committing to exempt the Western Balkans from visas, following the first stage when the two countries did not fulfil the requirements, we can now reaffirm and welcome the commitment that finally, Albanians and Bosnians are going to be able to travel to EU territory. Mr President, Commissioner, the need to bring stability to the Balkans, especially to countries that will certainly join the Union in the future, and to facilitate the mobility of a population that is currently isolated, must, in my view, be one of Parliament’s political obligations. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to condemn the degrading and anti-democratic treatment by Hugo Chávez’s government of those who defend freedom and human rights. The detention of my colleague, Mr Iturgaiz, at Caracas airport cannot be overlooked. It is not the first time that the regime has launched an attack on members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Our mission as Members of this House is not limited to within the EU. It also involves promoting the values on which the Union is based such as freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. It is evident that this task is not well received by those that seek to impose totalitarian ideas on their citizens. The result of the parliamentary elections held on 27 September leaves room for hope, although we should all be concerned about the reaction to the progress made by the Venezuelan opposition. What can we expect from a government that harbours terrorists from the Oker terrorist cell, of an executive body that includes an alleged ETA murderer as the head of security of the Venezuelan National Land Institute, or of a government that ignores extradition requests for numerous terrorists who have fled justice? Obviously, we can expect nothing. Madam President, such contemptible attitudes deserve a strong reaction and the firmest possible rejection by Parliament. President. -

 Mr President, the security situation in Iraq is growing more precarious by the day. Since Major-General al-Karawi was killed in the Anbar province last December, violence in the region has peaked with clashes between government forces and ISIL. Fallujah is under siege, cut off from humanitarian supplies, and its residents labelled terrorists by their own prime minister, which is ludicrous. And it is not just Sunnis who are targeted but other minorities too. In Camp Liberty members of the Iranian Resistance, whose asylum-seeker status has now been officially recognised by the United States in addition to the European Union, live at the mercy of Prime Minister al-Maliki and those who control him from Tehran. We know that a new massacre is being planned by Prime Minister al-Maliki in Camp Liberty. Heat-oriented missiles have been transported to Baghdad by Iranian Quds forces in collaboration with Prime Minister al-Maliki. We know it. The High Representative knows it and I suppose that the President of the Council also knows. Inaction or soft diplomacy is not an option when three thousand men and women are under deadly threat. It is time for the High Representative and the Member States to do something effective for once. (Applause) President. -

The first part, which is a roll-call vote, is marked as a key vote.

Mr President, I would like to say to Baroness Ashton that she knows very well that under cover of the conflict in Syria that is concentrating the attention of Western governments and public opinion, the Iraqi Government has initiated the final phase of the physical liquidation of the 3 000 members of the Iranian democratic opposition that reside in Iraq. In relation to this, Baroness Ashton, I ask you immediately to do the following. Tell Prime Minister Maliki that, if there is another murder or the seven hostages are not freed, this will have severe consequences at a diplomatic, financial and political level for him and we will take him to an international court to answer for these crimes. Organise, with the United Nations, blue helmet protection for Ashraf and call for an urgent meeting of foreign affairs ministers of the Union to accept refugees in their countries. Anything less than that is a waste of time. President. −

 Mr President, Mr Juncker, if I remember correctly, you are currently the most senior member of the prime ministers of the European Council. You have seen my country, Spain, evolve from being part of the euro solution to being a founder member, and to today unfortunately being part of the euro problem, due to the government’s mismanagement. The Spanish Government has undertaken some reforms, but these are clearly still not enough to regenerate confidence in our country, confidence that existed in the past and that will exist again in the future. What advice would you give the next prime minister following the forthcoming elections in Spain? What reforms do you believe we should continue to carry out in Spain in order to recover confidence in the euro area, over which you preside? Antonio López-Istúriz White  (PPE

Mr President, the European Union is founded on values such as equality, solidarity and respect for all languages. We all share these principles. As Spanish Members, we support the idea of having a patents system for the whole of the European Union, and I congratulate my colleague, Mr Lehne, on that part of the report. We support anything that improves and expands the internal market. However, for such an important matter, a course has been chosen that is provided for in the Treaty – enhanced cooperation – which should be the last resort and fulfil a series of conditions. In our view, enhanced cooperation, on which we will vote tomorrow, is contrary to Articles 118 and 326 of the Treaty. Moreover, I believe that in the Council, the rules of the game have been changed, but my government will deal with that. The new Treaty is an unquestionably useful tool for the EU, but it cannot be used to establish a multi-speed Europe. Many countries that currently support enhanced cooperation will soon suffer the consequences themselves and, if the Council and the Commission continue to use enhanced cooperation in this way, ultimately we will all lose. Spanish is spoken by 850 million people. Out of the three languages proposed by the European Commission for the patents system, only one of them is comparable to Spanish in terms of size. What criteria were used? Efficiency? Are we talking about EUR 1 850? Then why not use only English and leave the other two languages, so we will also save by doing it three times rather than 20 times. Is it about timing? It was not Spain that opposed a patent in the past, it was other countries, which are now rushing to have one. Is it to do with politics, as I suspect? Care should be taken with bureaucratic manoeuvres that distance millions of citizens – and thousands of businesses that use Spanish – from the reality of the European Union. The system proposed by the Commission is contrary to the right of Europeans to express themselves in their language, it prioritises one language over others, it is clear discrimination against competition, it fragments the market and creates legal uncertainty. This battle has only just begun. Due to the haste of some, we are going to be faced with a legal action lasting several years in the Court of Justice, as my government has already said. The three institutions will have to give an account of the procedure followed and of why the warnings were ignored. This situation can be remedied if we return to the spirit and the letter of the treaties, which Spain has respected. Antonio López-Istúriz White  (PPE
).

Mr President, I think that all of us who believe in the European Union have reason to congratulate ourselves, particularly in these times of economic and sometimes political crisis. I believe that we have moved forward. We are taking a big step with the creation and launch of this European External Action Service. I would like to congratulate not only the High Representative, but also those involved – such as, for example, within the European Parliament, our colleague Mr Brok – who have facilitated the achievement of the agreements that were necessary for this. I especially liked the phrase that you used, Baroness Ashton, about how it is the interests of the European Union that need to be defended above all. I would also say to you – this is not advice, simply a comment – taking the position of my colleague, Mr Salafranca, that what is needed here is effectiveness. Moreover, I would add humility and effectiveness, following the example that the President of the Council, Mr Van Rompuy, is giving to us. I am sure that you will succeed and, of course, as General Secretary of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to give you my support, together with that of our entire group, in this enormous task that you are faced with.

 Madam President, I am addressing my speech to Orlando Zapata’s mother and to those suffering along with him in the fight for freedom in Cuba: they are not alone. Today, through this resolution – for which, in my capacity as Secretary-General of my party, I would like to thank the authors, and especially all the parties that have signed it – Parliament is speaking out as one against this isolated and decrepit dictatorship. Today, we are signing the beginning of the international death sentence for this regime. I am convinced, based on the majority of the speeches that I have heard, that we are all united in firmly and clearly condemning the death of your son. Many of us, however, are going further than this statement: you can rest assured that we will remain vigilant in order to secure the unconditional release of all political prisoners on the island. We will remain vigilant regarding the situation of human rights violations on the island. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will, of course, fight to maintain the European Union’s common position, and I am sure based on what I have heard that many others will do the same. We will not give mixed signals, but rather a clear guide for achieving our dream of seeing a democratic Cuba. The supreme sacrifice made by Orlando has produced a response in the good consciences of the whole world. Let us ensure that the silent sacrifice of thousands of Cubans is celebrated in the near future in a free Cuba. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo

 Mr President, allow me to begin by expressing my thanks to the Secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, particularly Ms Leffler and others who collaborated with me to make this report possible, including Ms Martín, Mr Kox and Ms Remacle. Mr President, it is almost over a year since the Committee on Petitions decided to draw up a report on waste management in the EU. The decision was taken after it was established that large numbers of repeat petitions were being put forward, condemning the poor waste management carried out by the authorities, the location of certain rubbish dumps, the destruction of some natural areas, and so on. The Committee on Petitions was sensitive to these claims, and sent several fact-finding missions to the areas concerned in order to verify in situ
 the truth of the complaints made by the petitioners. All of this has led us here today, to the plenary session of the European Parliament, in order to make it clear that the proper application of current legislation by Member States is an unresolved issue that requires particular attention and on which we should remain vigilant. As I said at the beginning of my speech, most European citizens expect public authorities to provide efficient and effective public services in terms of health, education, transport and security. However, the issue that provokes a growing number of petitions is the apparent inability of public authorities in many countries to deal satisfactorily with the problem of waste management. The European Union has adopted a broad raft of legislation, applicable in all Member States, in order to ensure that the legal framework exists to deal with the inevitable result of our modern lifestyle in terms of all the things we discard as waste from our household, from our place of work, from our hospitals, from our industries and so on. It is obvious to all that failure to manage such issues, and failure to prioritise efforts in this respect, produces not only negative effects on human health and well-being, but also on the viability of the planet and its environment. Judging by the petitions received, the concern of many local communities is growing, and this indicates that waste management is becoming a major political and social problem and people expect the European Union to deal with it somehow. An analysis of the waste management policies implemented in the Member States provides very contrasting information and serious breaches of EU legislation. The Commission reported in January 2011 that 177 infringement cases concerning landfills had been launched since the deadline for implementing the Landfill Directive in 2001. They had furthermore calculated that there were at the very least 619 illegal landfills still being used in the EU. In its strategic report on the prevention and recycling of waste, the Commission clearly demonstrates that it is using its best efforts to address the issue of waste management, and it also outlines its medium-term proposals. It should be recalled in this context, Mr President, that the large number of infringement cases mentioned aim at ensuring legal compliance, yet from the petitioners’ perspective, more effort needs to be made to ensure proper follow-up actions in the actual implementation of the law. Closely linked to the waste management process, although upstream of the process, are the EU directives dealing with environmental impact assessments and the access of citizens to information concerning the environment. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Georgieva for her interesting opinions and also my fellow Members who have participated in this debate. To some of the latter, I would like to say that comments have been made about the appropriateness or otherwise of holding this debate in the Committee on Petitions, and of referring the matter on from that Committee to this House. With your permission, Mr President, I would like to commend and defend the Committee on Petitions as an appropriate setting in which to debate these issues. I say this given that those who submitted petitions, the citizens of the European Union, have addressed the Committee on Petitions. Apart from the fact that citizens can address other committees, such as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and bearing in mind that opinions may be developed and reports drawn up in other committees, I think that when citizens approach the Committee on Petitions, they want us to respond and provide a solution to their problems. Clearly, we cannot look the other way or divert attention. Were we to do so, there would be no point to the work and actions of the Committee on Petitions within the European Parliament or, indeed, to the very existence of that Committee. In addition, I would like to say to certain colleagues that the petitions have referred systematically to the constant deficiencies that occur with waste management and to the real, habitual inability of the Member States to fulfil their legal obligations. This really is the way things are at present. These thoughts and problems have also been included in the report, however, hence the request for the Member States to transpose the Waste Management Directive without further delay, and to guarantee that all its provisions are fully complied with, especially through the establishment and application of comprehensive waste management plans. Therefore, Mr President, I believe that through this report and Ms Georgieva’s own words, a very direct course has been set to try to resolve all the problems that have been outlined by the groups, many problems that are related to this issue, but I also believe that it needs to be emphasised that delaying is not an option, nor can a blind eye be turned, when it comes to resolving the many, many issues and petitions that are being received from countries throughout the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pass on a message to you all from Oswaldo Payá, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize by Parliament. ‘Dear friends, the people of Cuba want change, they want to enter peacefully into a new phase of their lives, leaving behind anything that involves hate, violence, repression, lies and fear, opening themselves up to reconciliation and ready to take the path of progress in every respect. These changes, which are being imposed on us by law, are already present in the hearts and minds of the Cuban people, but the civil and political rights of the people need to be respected. There need to be free and democratic elections, and freedom to travel, work and participate in the economic, political and cultural life of the country. Changes are rights, and those rights are lacking in Cuba, where many people are still being persecuted for promoting the rights of the Cuban people and also imprisoned for that cause. The European common position is focused on solidarity and that position should be maintained. You should know that although the Cuban Government is not initiating the changes that many Cubans who are supporting the Varela Project and other civil initiatives desire, there are people working to achieve these peaceful changes at the moment. These are the initiatives that you must support, while remaining consistent with the common position so that it is also a joint approach.’ Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, it is my pleasure to come here, as we do every year, to present the annual report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions during the year 2009. As you know, this year, the activity of the Committee on Petitions was marked by the change from the sixth to the seventh parliamentary term, which has meant significant alterations to the composition of the committee, since two thirds of its members are involved for the first time. The report aims to offer a clear vision of the activity of the Committee on Petitions during the year and, ultimately, a more specific explanation of what submitting a petition to the European Parliament involves, as well as the possible result of the process, what it can achieve and its limitations. This report also examines the progress made in applying previous recommendations whose objective was to improve the committee’s work, and highlights the main challenges for the future in light of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, as well as confirming the right to petition the European Parliament as one of the pillars of European citizenship, has also established the necessary bases for increasing public participation in the European Union’s decision-making process, offering Europeans the opportunity to suggest improvements or additions to the Union’s legislation. To this end, the Committee on Petitions welcomes the fact that it is able, under Rule 50 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, to work alongside the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on drawing up the report on the European Citizens’ Initiative, which should be finished late this year. Moreover, following the same context of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament’s Committee on Petitions should forge closer working links with similar committees in Member States’ national and regional parliaments in order to promote mutual understanding of petitions on European issues and to ensure the swiftest response to members of the public at the most appropriate level. I would also draw your attention to the legally binding force acquired by the Charter of Fundamental Rights with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and underline the importance of the Charter in making fundamental rights clearer and more visible to all Europeans. I trust that all necessary procedural steps will be taken to ensure that the institutional aspects of EU accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will be taken. This goal is of vital importance if we take into account the problem of violations of property rights that the Committee on Petitions faces in certain Member States on a daily basis, knowing that neither the committee nor Parliament is in a position to take any legal action. I would also stress the excellent relations that Parliament has with the European Ombudsman. We particularly appreciate the efforts of the European Ombudsman to raise public awareness of its work, as well as to identify and resolve cases of maladministration by the European institutions. To this end, we support the idea that the European Ombudsman should establish an administrative code of conduct for the European Union administration. We call for the development of an online system that clearly indicates the various complaints mechanisms available to the public and which of these is most appropriate to their interests; the establishment of an online one-stop shop would be needed in order to achieve this. However, not everything was going to be positive. I would like to take this opportunity to protest at the practice – which has been constant since 2007 – of the Directorate-General for the Presidency and the Directorate-General for Communication, whereby items that are not petitions are registered as petitions, according to Rule 201(1) of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. I am talking about the so-called ‘non-petitions’. Processing them is an unnecessary waste of time, on top of the cost of dedicating staff to this. In order for you to realise the importance of this point, I will give you one figure: these so-called ‘non-petitions’ are up to 25% of the petitions registered. The practice of such maladministration endangers the rights of EU citizens. Finally, but no less important because of that, I would point out the need to adopt a code of conduct for the internal processing of petitions. To this end, I would encourage the secretariat and the representatives of the political groups to work on drawing up a revised guide for the benefit of Members on the internal regulations and procedures of the Committee on Petitions. In conclusion, my final words – and how could it be any other way, Mr President – are of thanks to the committee’s secretariat for its work and support in drawing up this report. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, thank you to all of the Members for their contributions. I believe that there is a thread running through all the speeches given by my fellow Members. This thread is the importance of the Committee on Petitions, because the faith and hopes of thousands of Europeans that their principal and real problems can be solved often rest on this committee. That is why, of all the committees, the Committee on Petitions – and several Members have said this – is the one that has the most direct relationship with the public, as Europeans are directly involved in it. The significance of this committee means that it must be safeguarded and loose ends tied up, so that all of us – Parliament, the Commission and the petitioners – may feel that the committee is even more useful. With your consent, Mr President, I will finish by asking the Commissioner to take note. I know that the Commissioner will do so, because many of the complaints that we have heard from fellow Members are completely justified. The following comments that have been made are totally justified: there is a lack of information, and it is true that certain petitions have been paralysed and were not completed. I therefore believe that we must not be distracted but must see the issue through to the end. Those petitions that have been initiated, and which remain open and with unresolved issues, must be resolved. I believe that in your capacity as Commissioner, you must make efforts to try to solve the complaints that you have heard here in this House today. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

 Mr President, a Spanish Central Criminal Court judge has confirmed what many of us were already aware of, namely that Hugo Chávez, the President of Venezuela, cooperates with ETA and FARC terrorists. This proves that Mr Chávez is in cahoots with terrorists, that he gives sanctuary to murderous terrorists on Venezuelan soil, and that he helps them by bestowing official positions in the Venezuelan Government upon them. Essentially, Mr Chávez is cooperating with ETA criminals. As a Basque, a Spaniard and a European, I wish to denounce and condemn the appalling attitude of the dictator Hugo Chávez. I urge the European institutions to take all necessary measures to condemn Mr Chávez and thus also condemn his policies in support of terrorists. I would also remind Mr Rodríguez Zapatero’s government, which currently holds the rotating Presidency of the European Union, that there is no point in being friendly and wishy-washy with Mr Chávez as it has been to date. There is no point either in displays of affection, or in friendly gestures and cooperation, because when the Spanish Government goes back on its word and humbles itself before Mr Chávez as it has done recently, this is tantamount to punishing the victims of terrorism, disdaining the Spanish justice system and thereby punishing freedom and democracy.

 Mr President, I regret that some of those present in the House today should opt to congratulate Mr Chávez, who is in cahoots with terrorists and has included ETA leaders in his government. My group and I, faced with a choice between Mr Chávez and a Central Criminal Court judge like Mr Velasco from a state governed by the rule of law, have no hesitation in supporting that Central Criminal Court judge. Furthermore, if Mr Rodríguez Zapatero were to stop being all matey with Mr Chávez and humbling himself before him, and instead treated Mr Chávez as what he is, a terrorist supporter, the credibility of Spanish foreign policy on the international arena would be enhanced.

Mr President, I would like to condemn in this House the continual provocations, abuses of power and threats by the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez. With his dictatorial method of government he is threatening, among other things, freedom of expression in Venezuela and democratic order in Latin America. President Chávez has closed down thirty radio stations and some television channels. He is threatening and punishing journalists in Venezuela because they do not support his autocratic regime. Because of all this, Mr President, it should also be pointed out that while there are power cuts, water shortages and food shortages in Venezuela, and poverty is continuing to grow due to poor management by the Chávez Government, the Venezuelan tyrant is trying to cover it all up by blowing up border bridges and threatening Colombia. He is praising international terrorists and aligning himself with the despotic dictators of the world, and his words and speeches are continual provocations and war cries aimed at destabilising the American continent. This is why Parliament, which is always committed to freedom and democracy in any part of the world, must strongly condemn the autocratic and dictatorial policies of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela.

Mr President, I would like my first words to be words of congratulation, as is only right, to Mrs Paliadeli, on the report she has presented, first of all before the Committee on Petitions and now here in plenary. I would also like to endorse the very sensible comments made by Mrs Gruny and Mrs Mazzoni, my colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), but, Mr President, I would like to add that the role of the Ombudsman is essential in a democratic institution. That is the conclusion that we in the Committee on Petitions have drawn, during the many visits by Mr Diamandouros to present his annual reports, like the one we are today examining in this House, or other reports within his remit. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not propose to drown you in numbers. However, although progress has been made in the role of the Ombudsman, I have no doubt that if we were to conduct a survey of European citizens on the role of the Ombudsman, his work and his activities, we would unfortunately find that citizens see him as remote and, in many cases, are not even aware of his existence. Perhaps this is because the Ombudsman’s decisions are not binding, as he himself reminded us here, or perhaps because his work is very restricted as far as the Member States are concerned, as Mr Diamandouros has pointed out in this House. However, if we want to provide a service to citizens, then this institution – the European Parliament – and the Committee on Petitions must make an effort to strengthen and promote the work of the Ombudsman. While there are certainly many petitions, as has been pointed out here, especially on the lack of transparency, I am sure that the proper provision of information – such as the new website, which is now working, which I welcome – would make a much greater contribution, and I would like to insist on this point, to the objective that, I think, will be endorsed by all: that all citizens of the European Union should be aware of and be able to contact the Ombudsman. For this reason, I wish the Ombudsman all the luck in the world and every success, because his successes will be the successes of European citizens as a whole. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

Mr President, I would be pleased if certain left-wing Members of this Parliament who are issuing resolute condemnations of Honduras would issue similarly forceful condemnations of what is happening in Cuba, or what Mr Chávez is doing in Venezuela and in Latin America, because, unfortunately, some people still hanker after and support the Berlin Wall, the purges of Stalin and even the mummy of Lenin more than democratic elections in a country, as in this case in Honduras. Having said this, with the forthcoming elections, some serious thought should be given to what has happened in this Central American country. Mr President, presidential elections in Honduras were called 16 months ago. The members of the electoral court, which is the body responsible for managing elections, were appointed before 28 June – they were therefore appointed under Mr Zelaya’s mandate. The six presidential candidates went through the primaries procedure, and the majority of the candidates want the elections in Honduras to be held. Therefore, why do some people not want to recognise the electoral process, if it was the natural outcome, whether or not Mr Zelaya was in power in Honduras? On 30 October, the negotiators of both sides made a commitment, it is true, by signing an agreement, to seek a solution to the crisis. The agreement contained a set of key points supported by both sides. The negotiators of the deposed President Zelaya did not establish, however, who should head the government of unity. It is therefore clear that the European People’s Party is in favour of the elections being held, under conditions of transparency, democracy and freedom, and we are going to support them with observers from our group. Let us not forget that it was the mediator, Óscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, who requested that they should go. In reply to a question from the delegation for Central America, he answered that it was necessary to send them, because the Óscar Arias Foundation itself was going to send observers to Honduras. We are going to do precisely that, because the international mediator, Óscar Arias, is also requesting it. Carlos Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

Mr President, this summer, the terrorist group ETA murdered three people in Spain, three people who defended law and freedom: an officer of the national police and two officers of the civil guard. I would like to express our solidarity, support and care to their families. ETA is a criminal group that has no place in Europe, because in the European Union there is no room for radicalism, totalitarianism or terrorist murders. The European Parliament and all the European institutions should therefore continue to condemn the ETA terrorists and continue to work to remove and eradicate the cancer of terrorist attacks by ETA and its accomplices from our continent I therefore want my first speech in this first ordinary plenary sitting of the European Parliament of this legislature to remember and pay tribute to all the victims of ETA terrorism, to condemn the terrorist organisation ETA in this House and to ask that, as Europeans, we all work together, with the law on our side, to smoke out ETA and its supporters, for the good of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.

Mr President, I want to concentrate on Ms Patrão’s report on shark fishing, and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate her on her excellent work and her spirit of collaboration. Having said that, there are not many others to be congratulated, particularly the European Commission, because this proposal is a clear demonstration of what should never happen in the fisheries sector. Its partisan approach and the clear lack of consensus contradict the principles of the next reform, especially the bottom-up decision-making process involving consultation – of both the sector involved and civil society – in order to reach a compromise. Commissioner, a compromise on measures that have such a serious impact on a fleet’s future cannot just be a compromise between you and the NGOs. You have positioned yourself exclusively on their side and that means that the Commission is working in the interests of one part of civil society, yet there is no compromise with those who are affected. I, personally, have been very much involved in this matter and have worked tirelessly with the sector to convince it of the need to relax its initial positions so that no one could object to the final proposals. I have done the same with the NGOs, but it has proved impossible because they knew that the Commission was on their side. Why, therefore, would they want to seek a compromise? In relation to what you said about the international dimension, Commissioner, I have just attended a meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICAAT), at which every single resolution on sharks was rejected, including one like the text that you are proposing: the debate on it lasted not even a minute and, indeed, the European Commission did not even say anything. Therefore, Commissioner, do you believe that under these circumstances it is necessary to condemn a fleet in the face of its competitors? Would it not have been much better to wait for ICAAT to take a decision? I would like to ask you to state publicly here that no finning takes place in the European Union. This is because of the comments during the NGOs’ campaign of lies. I would ask you to state whether or not there is any finning in the European Union. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE
).

Mr President, I believe that the Commissioner is also here to answer our questions. I asked her to state publicly whether or not the removal of fins, or finning, is common practice in the EU fleet, as many Members have said. I would like her to say whether or not that is true.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the rapporteurs for their reports, but may I highlight the excellent collaboration with Mr Gallagher, which has led to the adoption at first reading, with the agreement of all the institutions, of measures that will enable swift action to be taken to put an end to unsustainable situations, such as we are experiencing with Iceland and the distribution of mackerel stocks. With regard to the Stevenson report on the common organisation of the market (CMO), I shall make particular reference to the chapter on consumer information, to which Commissioner Damanaki referred, in which I believe the compromises reached clarify and simplify the original proposal. Commissioner, I believe that proposal confused quantity of information with quality of information, since it would – as in the case of Article 42(2) – call for a whole series of data to be given, complicating and unnecessarily increasing the costs to the industry, without being of any relevance to consumers, who would also be incapable of assimilating so many details. We have also tried to find a balance between the interests of the various segments of the fleet and industry. For example, the obligation to show the date of catch is in the interests of the smaller-scale fishing fleets but is very detrimental for the other fleets catching fresh fish, without affecting the quality of the catch. Replacing it with the date of landing, as included in the compromise reached, gives the consumer the same guarantees while allowing the date of catch to be included as part of the voluntary information, if so wished. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I want to thank the Commissioner for attending. I hope he can hear me. I can see the Commissioner leaving, which is really depressing, as what he said and the solution he proposed in this notorious compromise he supports so much is a solution that is totally against the principles of the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU). That is why I would have liked the Commissioner to hear this debate. Moreover, the problem is that the Commission is handling all of this in a secretive, clandestine manner. It has been pure chance that some Members of Parliament, such as myself, have found out what has been going on. Neither the Commissioner for the Environment nor the Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries have ever been here to raise this issue when they know that the fight against IUU fishing is an absolute priority for us in Parliament. I would also like to know the reasons behind supporting the interests of countries involved in chartering ships, such as Brazil, New Zealand, Australia and the United States, when the price to pay will be to void Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, the objective of which is to combat illegal fishing. It will also weaken the European Union’s position in each and every international forum. That is the way it is. This issue precisely began to unravel in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). I also want to emphasise what has already been said, which is that this sets a very serious precedent, because all of this, as he said himself, will now be an issue for debate in all the international forums, especially in the regional fisheries organisations. Coincidentally, this will be discussed in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, given that it is one of the regional fisheries organisations where the most chartering occurs. It should not be forgotten that the philosophy on which the fight against IUU fishing is based is precisely the double safety net of state control over the port and flag state control over worldwide fishing catches. That is what has sown the seeds of panic in the exporting countries, which have suddenly seen the attractive EU market close. That is the root of all these problems. I hope, therefore, that this will be fully resolved by other means. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, unlike my colleagues, I believe that Parliament has managed to achieve a text for first reading that is very balanced between the measures needed for protection and recovery of the bluefin tuna agreed with the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), maintaining fleet activity and the strengthening of control measures. To do so, the Committee on Fisheries has removed some of the rapporteur’s extreme proposals, which would have led to the halting of the activity of the fleet of European vessels, and only European vessels, with the disastrous socio-economic consequences that would have been incurred. It is worth remembering that since 2006, there have been successive recovery plans for bluefin tuna, and as well as the fact that to change the game rules half way through and for only the European fleet would be unfair and discriminatory, it is doubtful the sustainability of the resource would benefit, given that the rest of the fleets could continue to operate. Lastly, I would like to insist on the need to shorten the period for the transposition of the recommendations adopted in the headquarters of the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) into EU law. In this case, the delay has been due to the incomprehensible opposition of the European Commission and some of Parliament’s groups to including provisions for implementing acts in the article of the regulation, which had reasonably been requested by the Council, with the aim of achieving legal security when it comes to the interpretation of particular technical aspects that could impede compliance with the control obligations set by ICCAT. Our political group, therefore, will oppose Parliament’s unilateral declaration proposed in Amendment 4. Carmen Fraga Estévez,

 Mr President, the fact that we are currently within the extension period of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Morocco is simply because the Commission did not fulfil its obligation at the time by requesting a negotiating mandate or reporting the agreement well in advance if it was not being fulfilled. This is nothing to do with the fishing fleet: they are neither responsible nor should they have to suffer the consequences. Therefore, I strongly advocate resolving this situation by ratifying it. I do not agree with those who oppose it, whether it is for the political issues in the Sahara, or the negative results in the fishing evaluation report. In that regard, I would like to refer back to 2006 and my report on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco when this Chamber was very firm both in terms of the benefits that the Saharan people should receive, as well as denouncing a disastrous negotiation, the loopholes in which have led to the poor results. I would stress, however, that I do not think any of these issues are going to be resolved by sending the fishing fleet home. On the contrary, I think we should look at the future of our fishing relationship with Morocco. Furthermore, Commissioner, we are again in the situation where there are less than three months of the extension period remaining and there is still no negotiating mandate. The sector is again plunged into uncertainty, but this time it has taken the initiative and acted responsibly alongside the Moroccan fishing sector and, with the agreement of their respective administrations, together they have drawn up an action plan for the future, which was delivered to you in Brussels last week. This is the reason why Mr Haglund, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and I, on behalf of my group, have tabled an oral question and a motion for a resolution which look to the future, a future based on new foundations which try to make up for the mistakes that were made and which have the approval of all interested parties. I simply request that the Commission is … (The President cut off the speaker) Carmen Fraga Estévez,

 Mr President, while we are waiting for proposed reforms of the common fisheries policy (CFP), the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wishes to express its alarm, once again, at the economic state of the fisheries sector. Until the proposal for its new common organisation of markets is tabled, the sector will continue to have almost no room for manoeuvre when setting prices. The rules on imports, many of which originate with illegal fishing, remain unfair competition for EU production: new monitoring obligations require companies to mobilise more of their resources and the general crisis does not exactly encourage increased consumption of quality products. To this must be added the upward trend in fuel prices, which is once again threatening companies that have already managed to survive the crisis of 2008. Far-reaching reforms of the CFP are envisaged and, in light of that, and in a context of ever decreasing structural aid, many companies could need liquidity to restructure or adapt themselves with a view to 2013. That is why we have tabled this oral question and this motion for a resolution before the House, given that this aid does not cost the EU budget anything and that, furthermore, the increase in aid being requested falls far short of the de minimis
 aid received by other sectors, such as transport or agriculture. We do not want to see ourselves in a situation like that in 2008, when we debated the package of measures adopted in extremis
 by Commissioner Borg. I would also like to say something to you, Commissioner: it is true that there are some Member States that will and others that will not be able to give this aid, and that, according to you, this will create disparity. However, greater disparity is created by the fact that some Member States do not cofinance the European Fisheries Fund, and that is something that is generally accepted. What needs to be proposed is aid, and any Member States wishing to defend their sectors will also be able to defend them. Carmen Fraga Estévez,

 Mr President, I must begin by regretting once again the complications that this report has encountered because of the resistance of the Council and the Commission to accepting Parliament’s powers of co-decision. In this case, we have a proposal for Greenland, as an overseas country and territory, to be able to export under the same conditions as those applied to a European Union Member State. This situation would benefit both Greenland, which exports 87% of its fisheries products to the European Union, and the Union; Denmark in particular, which is the recipient of the majority of these exports. One of the conditions for including Greenland in the single market import arrangements is that it should accept EU health rules, and this does not pose a problem in the least. Despite the trade in fisheries products being subject to the common organisation of the market, the Commission, using the need for compliance with health rules as an excuse, tabled its proposal based on Article 203 of the Treaty, which meant a simple and straightforward consultation procedure for us. Both the Committee on Fisheries and the legal services pointed out this anomaly from the outset. However, as it presents no problems in terms of content, and given its importance to Greenland, we are allowing the report to be processed under the consultation procedure. Imagine our surprise when, just as we were about to vote on the text and without prior warning, the Council adopted a completely different proposal, with numerous changes attempting to obscure the clear link with the common organisation of the market and so avoid co-decision. Since Parliament had – as I said before – already adopted the text using the consultation procedure without any problems, such manoeuvring was uncalled-for. Nevertheless, as we were faced with a new text, and given the clear proof that the Council’s goal was to erode Parliament’s powers, we decided that, this time, we would use those powers to the full and request a formal opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs. In that opinion, the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs was – and I am quoting directly from the text – that ‘the purpose of the proposed decision is to require Greenland to transpose EU health rules as a condition for the application of the EU internal market rules as regards fisheries’, as specified in Article 3 of the proposal itself, which guarantees that the agreement’s rules will be adapted to the applicable rules established in the Union as regards animal health and food safety, as well as the common organisation of the market in fishery products. Consequently, the Committee on Legal Affairs came to the unanimous decision that Articles 204 and 43(2) of the Treaty, along with Protocol No 34, which includes specific arrangements and procedures for products subject to the common organisation of the market in fishery products in Greenland, should form the legal basis for the proposal. Therefore, as rapporteur, I drew up another draft report, modifying the legal basis. That is what we are tabling for adoption tomorrow and, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, it is our first reading. All, then, that remains is for me to tell the Commission and the Council – which I believe to be absent – that they now have an opportunity to correct and recognise the new legal basis, and, therefore, to consider this the first reading, as we will be doing tomorrow. The problem is with the legal basis and not the content. I call for this problem to be solved with a view to the future. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur. 
− (ES)
 Mr President, I should like to give special thanks to the Commissioner for the answer she gave to my question, saying that she would be ready to accept the change to the legal basis, and I hope that the Council will also follow the same line that the Commissioner has set out. In any case, I had been considering the possibility of asking for this report to be returned to committee before it reached the final vote, but I later thought better of it and realised that it could only delay even further this proposal, which I believe is positive for Greenland and for the European Union, and that it would be advisable not to delay it more. I hope, anyhow, that the Council will go along with the intentions of the Committee on Fisheries, which are entirely justified, and I hope that a solution will be reached, given that the only problem is the legal basis and not the content. In any case, I am pleased that we have achieved this result; moreover, we always have the option of going to the Court of Justice if we see that it is advisable to continue with this matter. Anyhow, we will demonstrate goodwill tomorrow, by issuing our opinion, and we hope that the Council will respond and consider this Parliament’s first reading, as I have said. Therefore, thank you to the Commissioner for being prepared to cooperate on this issue in a straightforward way, and thanks to all my colleagues who have worked on and supported this report. All that remains is to hope that the Council will go along with our intentions, which are justified, as I have said, and endorsed not only by the Committee on Legal Affairs but also by the legal services of the European Parliament.

 Mr President, the Protocol of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Mauritania is due to expire on 31 July 2012. In view of the importance of this Protocol, the Commission has already asked the Council for a mandate for its renegotiation. We have been informed that the Council is currently studying a mandate proposal and will decide shortly. On the strength of Article 218 of the Treaty, which grants Parliament special powers in the final approval of fisheries agreements, we have already voiced our intent to make full use of the possibilities granted to us by the Treaty and the interinstitutional framework agreement to participate in shaping fisheries agreements, with the right to full information on an equal footing with the Council. We believe we should be involved in the process from the moment when the negotiating mandate is approved. The Fisheries Commission has thus decided to introduce a new procedure starting with the Mauritania Protocol, whereby we will submit an oral question and receive information on the future negotiations from the onset of the process. The procedure will also allow us to produce a draft resolution setting out our concerns on the agreement in issue – in this case, Mauritania – with the request that they be taken on board by the negotiators and ultimately become part of the final Protocol. The agreement with Mauritania is crucial both for the country itself and for the European Union. For Mauritania, it represents 29% of the national budget; for the European Union, it is one of the three mixed agreements still in force, allowing the presence of several different modes of fishing in the country’s waters, all of them vital for EU fish supplies. The significance of this agreement and the experience we have built up have prompted us to put forward a number of suggestions that will be reflected in the common resolution set to be negotiated by the political groups in the coming days, and also to voice a number of concerns on the way in which the current Protocol works. These concerns include the following: Firstly, Parliament must understand the importance of securing the industry’s support for the financial contributions and their correct use, bearing in mind the needs of both the industry and the Mauritanian fishing authorities in making headway towards an advanced, sustainable fisheries policy. Secondly, the joint scientific committee has a key role to play and care must be taken that it fulfils this role properly, as it is the body responsible for assessing resources and issuing recommendations on the biological status of populations, and therefore on the fishing opportunities available to the different fleets operating in Mauritanian waters. Thirdly, more information is needed on the catches of other non-EU countries operating in the area, so that we can accurately establish the real fisheries surplus that Mauritania can offer the EU, while also ensuring that the fishing opportunities negotiated are in line with the actual needs of the fleets. This will avoid any temptations to pay for ‘paper fish’. Fourthly, it is important, as far as the fishing fleet is concerned, to ensure that the technical measures for the different fisheries are negotiated at the same time as the fishing opportunities, thus putting an end to the absurdity of paying for resources that are technically impossible to catch. Lastly, urgent clarification is needed of Mauritania’s use of the Protocol’s monitoring provisions as regards its preference for methods other than the vessel monitoring system (VMS), and also its varying standards on ship arrests. It is important that both parties respect the agreed terms for the resolution of disputes in connection with such arrests, which must be preserved in the new Protocol. Commissioner, for all these reasons, we will be asking that the Commission, as the negotiator, takes into consideration these and other concerns, which will form part of the common resolution set to be approved at the next plenary session, and which our institution will follow very closely. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.

Mr President, Commissioner, exemption from the rules of origin is based on a very serious calculation error by the Commission regarding its impact, not only on the EU tuna sector, which is very serious, but also on the Pacific region, which we are seeking to help. Meanwhile, the real beneficiaries are almost exclusively the greedy fleets from China and South-East Asia and their processing industries. The Directorate-General for Trade established this exemption based on the fact that Papua New Guinea does not have the fishing capacity to exploit its resources. However, according to the most recent data from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, there are 41 seiners under Papua New Guinea flags operating in the area, which, in 2009, had a catch total of almost 500 000 tonnes. Out of this catch, more than 75 000 tonnes ended up in the European Union (semi-processed and processed), which makes Papua New Guinea one of the six main exporters to the European Union. It is not, therefore, true, as you say, that in order to develop Papua New Guinea’s fishing sector, other fleets needed to be given free entry. Under no circumstances can the European Union shirk its commitment to sustainable development. However, we are seeing that, under the protection of this exemption, and in order to bring in Asian investors, Papua New Guinea has amended its legislation so that it is not possible to make complaints about environmental damage, and has implemented investment rules that allow local workers and cheap labour from Asia to be hired, along with the worst imaginable labour standards. If we add to this the fact that, in the regional fisheries organisation that I mentioned, Papua New Guinea is leading other countries in flatly refusing to sign up to any international rules to manage and control fisheries, the result is that, while the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries is going the whole hog to combat illegal fishing, others are opening their doors to it. Commissioner, I have just come back from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, and I am well aware of the position that Papua New Guinea has taken. I therefore maintain the position of the Committee on Fisheries of asking for the exemption to be suspended in the review of the agreement that we are discussing. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, thank you very much to the authors of the reports for their excellent work. I would like to focus on management plans, although I will not go into any substantial aspects, as they have already been highlighted by the rapporteurs. Instead, I will refer to the significant institutional challenges they are creating, which must be resolved. After more than a year of negotiations with the Council, Parliament has quite responsibly decided to bring the reports to first reading with the aim of exerting pressure to break the current deadlock, which affects not only these two proposals but also all the others that are to be put before us in the near future. Parliament is willing to find a compromise solution with the Council and the Commission but the key requirement for that to happen is for the Council to acknowledge and accept that the basic core of long-term management plans must fall under the ordinary legislative procedure, that is, under the legal basis of Article 43(2) of the treaty. It is incomprehensible that before the Treaty of Lisbon, when the Council also had exclusive competence in matters of TAC and quotas, Parliament was asked for its consultative opinion, whereas now, the Council claims exclusivity on these same matters, even though, according to all legal advice, Article 43(3) must be interpreted restrictively. I therefore urge the Commissioner to take account of Parliament’s position, even if any proposals – and I believe Mrs Bilbao’s question on this particular point has not been answered – were to be withdrawn or replaced by new texts. Failure to do this will compel us to refer the matter to the Court of Justice and to block future long-term plans, which is to be avoided insofar as it is a basic instrument of fisheries management. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, allow me to express my gratitude to the Council and the Commission for arriving at this excellent agreement at first reading, and I would particularly like to thank the legal services of all three institutions for their cooperation and help in resolving the problems arising from the new committee procedure following the Treaty of Lisbon. I believe that we have reached a good compromise, especially as it represents significant progress compared with the current situation, although, as in any compromise, we have all had to make concessions and be flexible, in what has been an especially complex task, as the Commission proposal arrived before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This meant that at the same time, it had to be adapted to the new situation, in particular, to Articles 290 and 291 of the treaty, relating to delegated acts and implementing acts. As this is a transposition into EU legislation of recommendations issued by a regional fisheries organisation, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) in this case, but which will be followed by many others, Parliament’s objective was fundamentally to establish a mechanism which would enable the transpositions to take place as quickly as possible, preventing internal bureaucratic delays from preventing us from responding correctly to our international obligations, as has been the case so far. Therefore, the new wording of Article 48, following the compromise reached with the Council on the subsequent amendments to this regulation, will enable the Commission both to comply with the obligations imposed by the NEAFC and to adapt to new recommendations that may arise in the future, through the delegation of powers. It is true that the Commission wanted it to be possible to revise all the articles in the proposal through delegated acts, and the compromise agrees that this will be the case for the majority of the articles, except in areas such as the recording of catches, tranships, inspections or monitoring of infringements: in other words, fundamentally matters relating to control and supervision, which will remain outside the framework of the ordinary legislative procedure. In any case, Commissioner, Parliament commits to amending this procedure if it is shown that the inclusion of these aspects within the scope of the ordinary legislative procedure could endanger compliance with the European Union’s obligations and, especially, those of the Commission, as a contracting party to the regional fisheries organisation. This is why we consider that this compromise represents a significant step forward, not only in relation to this specific proposal, but in order to lay the foundations for future discussions between the Council, the Commission and Parliament on fisheries policy. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that I believe that the example set by this most recent regulation on the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), which we are going to adopt tomorrow, is not a good one, because what has happened is precisely what we want to avoid. The Commission put forward the proposal late and the procedure has changed, as we have changed from the consultation procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure, and the proposal as a whole has been changed in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. That is exactly what we are avoiding through this compromise. Through the new wording of Article 48 of the regulation, which is the article that provides for the amendment of the regulation in future in order to transpose the various NEAFC recommendations into EU law, in the majority of the articles, we have delegated powers to the European Commission. We have only maintained and preserved the ordinary legislative procedure in a few areas, which was the compromise with the Council. A significant step forward has therefore been taken to ensure that this functions in the future, but even so, Commissioner, I have made a public commitment here that if, in the future, it does not function adequately and we are prevented from fulfilling our obligations, Parliament will be prepared to revise the procedure. I believe that we have made quite a considerable effort, and I think that this is a significant step forward as a starting point. We are sure that the Commission will be capable of using the new powers that the Council and Parliament has granted to it. Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner. I am sure that this is going to work much better than what we had in the past. Of course, Commissioner, you are the one who is going to have the tools to ensure that this is the case.

Mr President, this report originated as a response to the frustration and lack of defence of the EU fishing sector. Commissioner, this sector is not asking for protectionism, what it is asking for at this stage, given the history of disregard by those in charge of the Directorate-General for Trade, is that it is not sunk even further. In this regard, we particularly support the request in the report by Mr Cadec that negotiations on the fishing chapters are transferred from the remit of the Directorate-General for Trade to that of the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, as is the case with agriculture, as we are also dealing here with products that are particularly sensitive, tuna being the classic case. On the subject of tuna, we have a scandalous example in the waiving of the rules of origin without the conditions being taken into account in the agreements with Papua New Guinea and Fiji, which only serves to favour our main competitors: Thailand and the Philippines. Commissioner, are you aware that, in addition to strangling the EU sector, thanks to your policy, Papua New Guinea is entering a phase of very low-quality job creation and zero sustainable development? Are you aware of the reports by non-governmental organisations operating in the region of child labour, insanitary conditions and lack of hygiene in factories, the disastrous environmental impact on the Madang coast and illegal fishing? Is it your responsibility to prevent this? Carmen Fraga Estévez,

Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work and on how easy he made it for all of us to work with him and produce a good report. We should be pleased because for the first time we are going to adopt a report on fisheries under the ordinary legislative procedure, at first reading and with the agreement of all three institutions. Parliament’s amendments were essentially aimed at incorporating the new recommendations that arose at the meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in 2009, as the Commission’s proposal only included the 2008 recommendations. They were also aimed at clarifying and specifying some definitions and technical specifications in order to ensure that the obligations of all operators and each of the Member States involved in bluefin tuna fishing were crystal clear. The aim is that the origin of all bluefin tuna that comes to EU markets can be identified so that if this cannot be verified its sale can be banned. As the rapporteur acknowledges in his report, we have therefore arrived at the most comprehensive documentation programme in existence for any species. This means that we can send a message of confidence, while acknowledging that the international organisation that governs the management of bluefin tuna is very capable of reacting for itself in terms of monitoring its status and responding to networks for the illegal fishing of a species whose trade has reached a level of complexity that surpasses that of any other species. Despite the criticisms, without the knowledge and experience acquired by ICCAT it is more than doubtful that any other organisation would be able to take the same type of measures as swiftly and with the same knowledge of the facts. We therefore trust that the entry into force of this regulation will not only help the recovery of the species and the fight against illegal fishing of that species, but also that it will help to reintroduce a minimum level of rationality and objectivity among the public, and especially within some non-governmental organisations. As the rapporteur said, the ball is back in ICCAT’s court, and I would like to add that it never should have left ICCAT’s court. I say this on behalf of my group. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE
).

 Mr President, everything is at stake in this reform. If we are not courageous now, there will not be another opportunity to create a genuine fisheries policy and we will be partly responsible for its failure. The CFP has, for years, suffered increasingly justified criticism and it would be disheartening if, when we are being offered one last opportunity, this Parliament were to prove incapable of proposing alternatives to what we have criticised so many times, in particular, the obvious failure of the conservation and management system, as demonstrated by both the state of resources and the decline in the sector. I simply cannot understand any reluctance to clearly suggest alternatives, as discussed in this House in 1996, such as transferable quota systems or effort-based management, which have had such positive results and which could help to maintain the more industrial fleets at least. The report says that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution, but at the same time, it closes the door on the possibility that there might be other solutions. I do not understand the contradiction, nor do I understand why, if someone does not want to use an instrument, the solution must be to prohibit it for everyone. That is not protection of the weakest; it is fear on the part of some sectors that only see permanent subsidies as solutions. The CFP should also guarantee competitiveness in a globalised world of fisheries products. The market for these products will undoubtedly continue to grow but it seems that it will grow without us. The policies within the Union should be coherent and we must ensure that the trade policy and rules on origin, such as those that appeared in the new economic partnership agreements, do not destroy the competitiveness of Community fisheries without being anything other than mere gestures to third countries; otherwise, it is our fisheries sector that will suffer. Mr President, consensus is a good thing when it results in progress, but not when we remain motionless in the face of problems, and we have many problems to solve. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I would also like to talk about commercial fishing species, and I would like to make it very clear that regional fisheries organisations are already responsible for managing and conserving these species. In fact, one only has to skim through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to realise that it is perhaps designed for elephants and polar bears, but it is not, of course, designed for commercial fishing species. I am not against protecting bluefin tuna, as that would be absurd, if only because of its importance to the fleet. I do, however, think that the measures need to be decided by bodies that have the best specialists in both managing fisheries and scientific research, because there is a reason why the CITES has to take external advice when it receives proposals on these species. I therefore think that the proposal to include bluefin tuna in Appendix 1 of CITES is unnecessary and unjustified, because it already has the measures imposed by International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). It is unfair, because it would gratuitously damage a fleet that has just embarked on a huge drive to reduce fishing, and even counterproductive, because it could give rise to an uncontrollable black market in bluefin tuna. I understand the enormous pressure that public opinion in general and this House in particular – as we are seeing – is experiencing from environmental NGOs. My political group has therefore decided to support inclusion in Appendix II as a compromise between the proposal of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and those of us who think that fisheries management cannot be snatched away from regional fisheries organisations. Our proposal is indeed based on the scientific advice to CITES. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) has recommended that bluefin tuna only be included in Appendix II of CITES, which demonstrates that many people have not even read the FAO report. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE

 Madam President, while illegal fishing in the Indian Ocean may be occurring, the Community fleet can certainly not be described as illegal, as has been suggested here. The Community fleet fishes within the strictest bounds of legality, with licences issued under the European Community – Seychelles Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which regulates and manages tuna fishing in the area. Secondly, all Community vessels are equipped with a satellite monitoring system, through which they can be located in real time and at all times by the fishing and military authorities. Thirdly, the Community fleet has observers on board and complies with a strict regime of providing information on fishing activity through fishing logbooks, catch samples and a ban on transferring goods at high sea, among other measures. Lastly, the entire Community fleet has been duly entered in the IOTC regional fleet register. I personally would like both the Commission and the Council to acknowledge that the European fleet fishing in that area is doing so within the strictest bounds of legality. Carmen Fraga Estévez,

Madam President, thank you very much to the rapporteur and to the Committee on Budgets for accepting all of the amendments from the Committee on Fisheries. What is particularly important for us is the amendment calling for greater flexibility in the funding granted to Regional Advisory Councils on fishing. As well as being scarce, the funding is so subject to interpretations and to the discretion of the Commission that the Councils are prevented from spending even the little that they have; this request was made to us unanimously by the seven existing councils. One amendment that we consider particularly opportune calls for a comprehensive strategy to combat piracy that genuinely considers the situation of fishing boats, which are particularly vulnerable to these acts in all the world's waters. With regard to research and the Seventh Framework Programme, as in previous years, we have demonstrated prudence and asked that, now that fisheries research no longer has its own heading in the budget, at least the percentage of investment should not decrease, as all decisions on fisheries management hinge on knowledge of the environment and of marine species, especially given that one of our new objectives is to apply an ecosystem-based approach to all legislation in the Common Fisheries Policy. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Seeber. I would like to express a series of basic ideas that I believe are important. Firstly, a market in water cannot exist without greater transparency and a very clear idea of, and an obligation for countries to determine, where the water originates. Transparent management must be in place, along with knowledge of the water in the aquifers and how it is distributed. This process has not been designed; it is not yet a political tool and needs to be developed, as does aquifer control using a digital system. I also believe it is necessary to control the issue of shale gas and its impact on aquifers. I find it utterly dangerous and perhaps careless, and I am aware of the Commissioner’s interest in monitoring the specific impact of shale gas on aquifers. I also believe that, when it comes to drought, we have too many diagnoses and very few solutions. Any directive should relate to the agricultural production system and include solutions. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, there is an issue that concerns me: the fact that water is not a renewable product for many. Water is sometimes renewable, but not always. Many aquifers are not renewable, but water returns to the ground. The problem is that it does not always return to the same place it comes out; for example, the water that evaporates from the Mediterranean forms the rain that falls over Austria or Prague, and that aspect needs to be taken into account. I think transboundary water agreements are very good, and I think that the Commission should place much greater emphasis on them. As the directive lays down, a river has to be managed in a uniform and unique way, but this approach needs to be strengthened a great deal, and international relationships with respect to transboundary waters need to be promoted. That is essential in my view, and we will see it with Turkey, which will never agree, but we must insist. However, I think the monitoring of aquifers is very poor. The technology exists to monitor aquifers. Most damage is done through illegal extraction of water from aquifers. I therefore think it is vital that this aspect is taken on board, and technology exists for that. I also believe that the relationship between agriculture and water should be reviewed, because it should not be the case that crops that consume a lot of water are treated in the same way as those that do not. If we put a price on water, which I support in agriculture, and which occurs in my country and region, it should be taken into account that corn and lettuce, for example, consume much more water. We are then exporting water to all the countries to which corn or lettuce are exported. That needs to be reflected in agricultural prices. It is an issue for consideration. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 Madam President, I think that Ms Gardini’s report is very good and a great effort has been made. However, I would have liked it to have looked not only at prevention, but also at what will happen next. One of the extremely serious problems in Haiti, for example, in Lorca during the recent earthquake, and in L’Aquila, is precisely that, while lives have been saved and life has returned to normal, there is a need to rebuild cities, cities that took years and thousands of years to be built. They have to be rebuilt all of a sudden. They have to be built, and there is a science and technology to help with this. It is not possible to build on just any ground after an earthquake. It is important to find out which ground is the most suitable. Where is the special European Union unit to coordinate all the knowledge within all the sections? We are told that the new cities must be energy efficient, that they have to be smart cities, but how does one make the transition from a destroyed city to a smart city? In this area, Europe has abandoned its people. It has not put in place any coordination measures, and there is a need, Commissioner, to coordinate the reconstruction work and ensure true flood prevention. There is a need to look at how to control the rivers. Other countries, such as Spain, have achieved this to a large degree. One cannot stop talking about a disaster the day after it has happened. This is why I am much more concerned about what happens next, and I believe that this is where Europe must start to act. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Matias for her report. I would especially like to say a number of things to Ms Geoghegan-Quinn: firstly, do not disregard small projects. Silicon Valley was built on small projects. Europe needs a great many of these so that small universities may be brought on board. Secondly, I believe that what Europe needs is human resources. Large projects should be tied to a scholarship programme so that more grant holders can go to large universities and institutes to receive training. I think both the Structural Funds and this system should pay less attention to buildings – Europe has a plentiful supply of buildings but is indeed lacking in human resources. I also believe, Commissioner, that you will find you have the full support of Parliament if Member States are also required, through the European Research Area (ERA), to simplify their procedures. Europe’s efforts at simplification should be met with transparent procedures on the part of the Member States, which will have to commit themselves, given that they will be receiving money. Commissioner, you will have Parliament’s full support if we aim to achieve simple, transparent Council procedures. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines,

 Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude for the work done in this report. However, I have to say that an agreement between the political groups has not been reached. This is a very significant report because it breaks the unity of environmental policy that has always existed in Europe. The break is a result of requests to which the Commission, of course, has rightfully replied. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is not totally united either. However, we have reached some basic agreements in which we understand, firstly, that the legal pillar cannot be changed as it puts the internal market in danger. The internal market is one of the most important values that we have achieved. It safeguards agriculture and our negotiations before the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Therefore, we want a report that, within the uncertainty it creates, is well-founded on an adequate legal construct. Secondly, we seek to strengthen the scientific nature of decisions. We have a large body, the European Food Safety Authority, which we cannot weaken by returning to taking decisions only from the criteria of national authorities. Therefore, we support the fact that decisions should be taken on a case by case basis, that they should not be subjective, and that we should also bear in mind we are now subject to grand populist policies and media pressure that can often make us lose sight of clear and objective scientific values. Finally, we want to say that is necessary to safeguard agriculture in Europe. It is necessary to strengthen Europe. I want to add something more: certain forms of nationalism are the greatest and most dangerous form of euroscepticism. I believe democracies based on national parliaments have been talked about here, and we must take into account that the joint European policy is also democracy and it has produced a major environmental policy. Therefore, the Group of the European People’s Party officially supports the report although there are groups, such as the Spanish delegation, that think differently. It is obviously going to support the Commission’s Dalli report but it is not going to support the Lepage report if our amendments are not adopted. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Mr President, thank you very much for your compassionate and supportive words. The Lorca tragedy is becoming clear. At the moment, we know that eight people have died, among them two pregnant women and a twelve year-old boy, more than 250 have been injured and 80% of houses are affected. That is to say, from now on and for the moment, many Lorca citizens will be homeless. A large portion of Lorca citizens have also lost their places of work and with them have gone their hopes, expectations and opportunities. Lorca is a city of 70 000 inhabitants, of whom 20% are immigrants that the city has received, taken in and been able to give a new life with new meaning. I know that together, the old and new residents of Lorca, with help from the institutions and from everybody, will be able to begin a new journey in their lives. I also have to say and call on the European Union not to leave anyone behind and to be able to help those affected, recognise their pain and stand by their side, opening their arms and offering opportunities. I would like to thank you all very much and to ask for a minute’s silence. (Applause) Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 Mr President, I must thank all my fellow Members who have understood the problem of the Mediterranean region, the Spanish delegation, and all those who understand that we in the Canary Islands, Murcia, Valencia and Almeria, in addition to being frustrated at the Commission’s failure to honour its agreements, and to having seen many companies forced out of business, remain the entry point for immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, the entry point for Moroccan immigrants, and a buffer against the crisis. This is because we are currently supporting, at a time of utter economic penury, people who come to work and are able to send money home to their families. Therefore, I believe that the Commission must also behave responsibly with regard to the competences granted to it by the Treaties. I believe the Commission has not given any thought to the need to defend the interests of the public, or to the need to prevent an indiscriminate policy which, moreover, makes us import produce grown in extremely dubious phytosanitary conditions.

Mr President, I would like to celebrate the fact that there is innovation, attention to innovation, and also partnership, but I would also like to say that we do not know what this thing is that we are talking about. We are talking about an initiative, but no one has told us about its content, its formula or its model. I would suggest that, first of all, if we want to be efficient, as some fellow Members in this House have said, we review the results of what has happened with the Institutes for European Training and Information (IETIs), the partnerships and the platforms. Now that we have had experience with the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, we need to evaluate these things objectively, with external evaluation, looking at the results. In the cases of some IETIs, for example, we have seen that they have ended up being dominated by large companies, and once again, small businesses have been left out. I would suggest that there be policies and formulas for innovation to see how we can help small businesses to get involved, perhaps sometimes through intermediary bodies that help them to pay for the projects or to carry them out. We cannot, however, carry on this way, leaving small businesses out. Secondly, we need to consider the need for innovation in administration, in other words, innovation in the management of innovation. This is because the market guides innovation, and administration is not used to following the market, which works much faster. We therefore need to do much more capacity building, innovate in capacity building and innovate in administration for research, in order to manage research and help businesses to get to work on this very difficult and complex undertaking for the future. Of course, we also need to incorporate the banking system in terms of the risks involved, which should not only be undertaken by the European people. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Mr President, I think that in the Year of Biodiversity, we have talked a great deal about the disaster that is happening, but very little about solutions. I think that society needs solutions and new ways of approaching the problem. Firstly, the division of Europe into bio-geographical areas should be translated into a specific policy because the problems in the different areas of Europe are not the same. We should therefore have a micro-policy on biodiversity, because biodiversity is a local issue. Secondly, it is terrible that we should be turning our back on all action regarding soil and the abandonment of agricultural soil when the trophic cycles of animals require a detailed study of each area. This has not been done. It is not well known that in many areas, by planting certain trees, there will be more birds and by planting certain plants, there will also be more insects. Experts acknowledge that the lack of insects is the great tragedy of the loss of biodiversity, especially with regard to birds. Nothing is being said about the problems with soil, insects and the organic richness of soil. It appears to be a crime to talk about soil in Europe. Finally, I would like to say that the landowners are essential. An amendment on stakeholders that I tabled in committee was rejected. However, if we have birds or animals, will the farmers who plant the plants that they come to eat not have something to say? Will the owner of their habitat not have something to say? Will farmers not have something to say? I think that this method of imposing ideological dictatorships needs to come to an end in Europe if we want to achieve better biodiversity.

Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the pupils of the European Schools, whose qualifications are not recognised by the Spanish Ministry for Education. They are nearly all children of Spanish officials, and are being discriminated against and treated unfairly. The equivalence table that is being used, which was recently consolidated by the Spanish Ministry, deducts half a point or one point from pupils who have studied at the European Schools. Moreover, these are boys and girls who speak languages. This means that when they try to apply for degrees that have a high cut-off mark, they remain outside the system. We believe that this is inherently unjust.
 Firstly, because Spain signed all the agreements and conventions and is not keeping to them. Secondly, because it is basic discrimination. A country cannot go on purporting to be European when really it is treating pupils from our European Schools unfairly and discriminating against them. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 I would like to welcome Mrs Espinosa; I am very pleased that she is here. I am most concerned by the change in attitude, and the fact that our analysis of Copenhagen may well lead to a change in attitude. Firstly, I think that one of our problems is a lack of humility and realism, as my colleagues have already said. Above all, however, I am concerned that, when we have been to other countries, we have found that they do not talk about climate change but rather global change. The context in which we will be moving in Mexico, and the context in which we have been moving, is that of a growing population, a food shortage, a need for more agriculture, and limited land and water resources; therefore, any decision we take on climate change must be considered within that context. Of course, we must also remember that many countries have a right to develop. We thus need to take a systemic view, something that is lacking in our analysis of climate change. Climate change cannot be resolved on the issue of emissions alone. A sectoral, quantitative vision does not lead anywhere. What is more, we have to attach greater importance to science. In particular, I ask the Commission that those teams who tampered with data be checked and have their funding withdrawn, if the European Union is indeed supporting them, because this will discredit us forever. How are we going to coordinate on this matter? That is another very important question. How is the European Union going to organise itself in order to reach an agreement? We should have already started working on that this morning. Finally, the issue that concerns me: adaptation is carried out in the territory concerned, and we have to begin that process, once again, with a new, strategic vision of the territory; this includes productivity, strategic reforestation, regions, areas and districts devoted to agro-energy and, of course, water and biodiversity. We are lacking that vision. On this point, I think we need to think about the option of Structural Funds for new strategic plans in all regions in order to be able to carry out this adaptation; and decision makers should be invited to begin that strategic revision of the territory because we do not have responsibility for that area and it will be very difficult to work on it from Europe. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, it concerns me that frequently a lack of coordination means that sustainability criteria are not applied to agriculture. I would like to ask two questions: firstly, at a time when we are experiencing desertification in southern Europe, which is seriously impacted by climate change, and given that land use is the most important thing, why is money being paid to pull up olive trees and vines? This means that Europe is paying to have more desert! Are you going to stop this? Secondly, the agreement with Morocco: if Europe is conducting a common foreign policy, it must defend the interests of its citizens and of European production. Europe is negotiating the agreement with Morocco on its knees, without taking into account the principle of reciprocity, without guaranteeing health and that insecticide and food quality programmes will be maintained. How is it possible that this process is not only opening the door to products on top of the quotas, but that it is also putting quality at risk? Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I am going to talk about two concepts, namely coordination and flexibility. A problem has been found with all the matters that were discussed in the Council. In recent years, there has been an extraordinary lack of coordination between the different Directorates-General in the Commission. Climate change policy has frequently been considered independently of the scientific knowledge of the Directorate-General for Research. It has also been conducted independently of land use, for example, which is linked to climate change. My first question is as follows. Are you prepared to organise and strengthen internal coordination, in such a way that, when we appoint our commissioners, we can be assured that internal coordination is guaranteed? My second question relates to the fact that we are talking about competitiveness, about an economic crisis. Is the Commission also prepared to be more flexible on some matters such as REACH and its implementation, which is going to cause extraordinary damage to our own competitiveness? Is it prepared to be more flexible? My last idea on this coherence policy is that we cannot talk about the economy and recovery without talking about opening up the energy markets. There are countries that do not have an energy market, such as Spain in the case of gas. This means that prices rise and development becomes impossible. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

Mr President, the rapporteur, Ms García Pérez, should be congratulated on her work and on the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council of Ministers. It is shame that the Council is not represented here tonight with us. The new quality system for agricultural products is a simplification of the current system and a streamlining of current authorisation procedures, and that is good news. It is also a good achievement to have included the obligation to use the Union logo for designations of origin and protected geographical indications, given that it increases the exposure of European products. I think it is also worth noting that the provisions for protecting quality designations in bilateral agreements with third countries are strengthened, and that a legal basis for defending the European Union logo in those third countries is created, as I honestly think that the protection of European products in third countries should be a fundamental objective. It is a shame that this package has been somewhat stripped back during the negotiations and, I will say it again, it is a shame that the Council is not here to hear it, because the original quality package proposed by the Commission has been rather forgotten and the marketing standards and management of supply through quality designations of origin have been cut from the agreement, leaving it, as I said, a little empty. I think the Council’s blinkered attitude on these two issues is regrettable, as they refused to listen to Parliament’s reasonable positions. Supply management by means of designations of origin should have been defended, and will of course be defended in the single common market organisation. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, through the assistance of the European Union, food banks have been carrying out notable and recognised social work, which must continue in the future with the full support of Parliament. Solidarity and social and territorial cohesion is precisely one of the fundamental ideas behind European integration. The existence of a programme such as this is therefore vital in order to help achieve this. The current economic crisis is hitting European citizens hard. Eighty million people are below the poverty line and 43 million people have to weigh up whether to include protein in their diet twice a week. We can use the European Union budget to make a cohesive effort, which includes the common agricultural policy item. Ladies and gentlemen, as Members of this Parliament, we must encourage any initiatives to continue the food aid programme in 2014, and throughout the coming financial perspective period. The European Parliament has to forge an agreement with the Council and avoid selfishness at all costs in favour of European citizens. Esther Herranz García  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, apart from the 80 million poor people we are talking about, a further 43 million people find it hard to manage to eat animal protein twice a week. This situation could become worse because these people  – the ones who have problems managing to eat animal protein twice a week – could find themselves in dire straits, as the economic crisis is becoming even more acute. This is not exactly the best time for the European Union to be cutting the food aid budget in the run-up to the next multi-annual financial framework period. The agreement, endorsed by Parliament, extends food aid under the conditions requested by this Chamber. It also represents, however, a certain level of resignation towards the block that some Member States have kept up for several months in the Council. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to urge all of you here to take whatever initiatives are necessary to keep food aid going beyond 2014. Parliament should not stand idly by in the face of such an important humanitarian issue. We should not accept the status quo, and this means we should use the negotiations for the next multi-annual financial framework period to express our opinion on this issue, and to push for an agreement between the Council of Ministers and Parliament to ensure that aid for the poorest can be maintained beyond that date. Food banks have been able to provide a noteworthy social service thanks to European aid, and this should not be paralysed through the selfishness of some governments. This service has benefited 13 million people, which has enabled us, with minimal effort, to make the common agricultural policy a bit more important. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, last year Parliament’s Committee on Petitions asked the European Commission to amend the entry price system for fruit and vegetables entering the Union. This system allows products from third countries to enter fraudulently, as the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) itself has stated. These products are primarily Moroccan tomatoes. The Governments of Spain, France and Italy issued a statement last year that made the same request. We can combat this fraud by amending the Regulation on application of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for agricultural products, because the problem will not be resolved by aligning the Customs Code, Commissioner. For several years I have been speaking up within the Spanish Partido Popular
 about the need to stop new concessions to Morocco until such time as the European Union has the necessary instruments in place to ensure compliance with the agreement currently in force. The European Commission argues that the Member States should control imports. However, what the Commission does not say is that the current entry price system prevents national customs authorities from being able to properly trace the prices declared by importers in order to check for irregularities. Amend the Regulation on the application of the CMO for agricultural products and part of the problem will be solved. If you do not, the legal loophole in European legislation will prevent national authorities from doing their jobs properly. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to thank my colleague, Ms Patrão Neves, because, during the last few months, she has defended against all opposition this resolution which we are debating today and which we will vote on later. Ms Patrão Neves, with the support of the Group of the European People’s Party, has had to face many obstacles and I should like to congratulate her on the work which has brought us to this point. Ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, farmers received 50% of the final price paid by consumers; but today, in many cases, they receive less than 10%. At the same time, in 20 years, the market share for distribution chains has risen from 21.7% to 70%. Something is going on, and it is quite obvious. Measures must be adopted to ensure that food supply chains are more equitable, more equal and fairer. Firstly, the security networks provided by the common agricultural policy to ensure fair prices must be improved. We need an EU framework to guarantee fair relationships and avoid abuse. We must define and prohibit abusive practices within these margins. We must make production more concentrated, encouraging producers’, farmers’ and livestock breeders’ organisations. We must also ensure fair competition conditions for all producers with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities. I am referring to those producers outside of the European Union who do not meet the same standards in terms of quality, food security, animal welfare and all these issues which are so essential that we require our producers to meet such standards. Where do we do all of this? Well, in the next CAP reform, of course. We must improve contractual relations in this CAP reform. The aim will be to improve the position of the primary sector within the chain, improve distribution trade policy, avoid the constant increase in food speculation, take into account and improve those margins which are causing a rise in non-agricultural costs, and, finally, assure producers that all products on the EU market meet the same quality standards.

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, I am glad that you are here with us this morning, and I hope that today you will answer me a little more seriously and a little more clearly. In the proposed reform of the common agricultural policy that you presented to us on 12 October, you spoke of eliminating the sugar quota system, and you also spoke about ending vine-planting rights. Parliament, which has recently voted on the report by Mr Dess, is in favour of continuing planting rights beyond 2015 and not liberalising them. It also wants to maintain the sugar quota system until at least 2020. Are you going to support Parliament’s position and Parliament’s decision on these two issues? Esther Herranz García  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 If I have understood you correctly, Commissioner, given that there are now 15 Member States in the Council that think differently, as they did before, and given that Parliament is continuing its commitment to vine-planting rights, does this mean we can be relatively optimistic about the Commission’s proposal next year in the wine report? Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, this morning the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, brought this subject up in the debate on the state of the Union. That gives us an idea of the importance the Commission affords this issue. He spoke about hope, inclusion and solidarity. At a time of economic crisis such as this, when there are ever more unemployed people, and ever more people living close to the poverty line, this deadlock shown by some Member States is the most absolute example of a lack of solidarity. Those countries that are opposed, the richest of the European Union, may endanger the continuation of a programme that, with 1% of the common agricultural policy budget, helps 18 million people. The Commissioner is right to shame those Council members who are incapable of showing solidarity at this time. I urge the Polish Presidency, between now and the end of its term, to continue with its support in order to move forward with this programme. It deserves that. So do all the people who need it, and the EU also deserves that vote of confidence and, above all, that response to its citizens. The EU Council of Ministers should take into account Parliament’s view that the programme should not only be maintained but also improved, as this House called for yesterday. I would also like to remind the Heads of State or Government that we hope and trust that at the next summit they will take these matters seriously and find a political way out of this deadlock.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, though today’s debate focuses on this important report on the reform of the common agricultural policy, I should like to comment on a side issue that affects us and could affect the viability of the postulates we are defending in Parliament in connection with the reform of the future of the CAP. Next week, the European Commission will present its proposal on the financial prospects for the post-2014 period, in which, if my information proves correct, the Community executive is decidedly intent on proposing cuts to the EU agricultural budget. It must therefore be borne in mind that the European Commission will not take on board the opinion that we will adopt tomorrow, in which we specifically request the expenditure of the common agricultural policy to be maintained. I fail to see how, with a reduced budget, we will be able to rise to all the challenges described in that document; how common agricultural policy subsidies will be made greener, a process we want to ensure will not require an additional effort on the part of agricultural and livestock farmers; how we will be able to achieve this. I fail to see how, with a diminished CAP, we will be able to respond – just to give another example – to price volatility, and establish a budget line, as is our intention, that will rise to the crisis we have come to know so well. The CAP should not be measured merely in terms of expenditure because, in addition to the goods and services it provides, I believe it should be made clear – today of all days – that EUR 1 invested in agriculture generates EUR 10 of wealth in the agri-food sector. This should be very much taken into account when it comes to setting the next budgetary framework. Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that negotiations with third countries and with the World Trade Organisation pose a serious threat to the future of agricultural and livestock production in the European Union. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, one can only express a deep sense of sorrow for the 23 fatalities: 22 in Germany and one in Sweden. This crisis is clear evidence that the European Union has a long way to go in improving its food safety alert system and its internal coordination. The Member States involved have been slow, inefficient and inoperative in their reaction, and, at this point in time, with 23 people dead, we still do not know where the problem is coming from. The European Commission must think hard about the problems it causes with its irresponsible actions or its failure to act at times of crisis such as we are seeing now. These lead to cases of financial ruin, the destruction of previously stable jobs, unemployment, helplessness and, needless to say, an extremely hazardous public health crisis. While you in the Commission paid heed to irresponsible statements issued by regional authorities in Germany – statements that were totally misinformed and quite irresponsible – mentioning Spanish farms by their names and addresses, the population remained exposed, without knowing it, to the bacterium. Thus, in the belief that they were avoiding contact with it, the public were more exposed than ever to eating potentially harmful food. In the Council of Agriculture Ministers that will be held in Luxembourg at two o’clock this afternoon, the European Commission should propose that a portion of the EUR 2 500 million left over from the common agricultural policy be put to use. Those EUR 2 500 million should be used to redress, in so far as is possible, the damage that has been caused. To enable this, a suitable legal solution will need to be found, as was the case in previous instances, for example, the ‘mad cow’ and dioxin affairs. One such solution should also be found now. Commissioners, Ministers, your actions in Luxembourg today must befit the stature of your office. Furthermore, the German authorities, in view of their reckless accusations, should definitely support this financial solution from the very beginning, and use funds of their own to conduct communication campaigns aimed at restoring consumer confidence in horticultural products, which is now in shatters. Esther Herranz García,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I would firstly like to express my gratitude to the Committee on Petitions for its hard work following the complaint brought by the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants, based on the report published by OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, in 2007. I believe this report’s conclusions are extremely clear and justify only too well action on the part of the European Commission – which should have addressed this matter a long time ago – to clarify the operation of the entry price regime, at least in relation to the tomato sector. However, not only having failed to take any action to prevent the different types of fraud made possible by the current Entry Price Regulation, the Commission has negotiated a new agriculture agreement with Morocco without having first resolved the shortcomings of the import regime currently in place. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the European Commission to take its responsibilities seriously, to start investigating where and how fraud is being committed, and, potentially, to demand payment of any unpaid customs duties. I believe that there is no way that a new agreement with Morocco should be ratified until all the details we have set out are resolved. Our aim is not to hinder new international agreements, but to ensure that such agreements will not seriously damage the interests of European producers, and that the rules laid down in those agreements will be adhered to. Where the new agreement with Morocco is concerned, all the European fruit and vegetables sector is demanding is a guarantee that the terms agreed will, in fact, be observed. This will only be made possible by reforming the entry price regime. We cannot have a new agreement with Morocco until we have a new system for entry prices. We will not be able to ratify the agreement that the Commission has already concluded. Moreover, if this supervisory role is to be played by the Member States, they should be required to make a significant financial contribution. However, it is also true that we have long been calling for a European borders and customs system similar to that of the United States, so as to ensure effective control. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

Mr President, in January 2012, 400 Spanish egg producers could disappear, which is around 30% of the total number in my country, with the loss of the production of 300 000 tonnes of eggs. The European Union could stop producing the 80 million eggs, which amount to 2 million tonnes, and if we do not act very intelligently, the only thing that we would achieve would be that they would be covered by imports from third countries, whose animal welfare standards are much lower than those in the European Union. This 1999 directive, which requires that the space in cages for laying hens be increased, demands that we act intelligently and positively, because otherwise, we will only weaken European production and give extra trade opportunities to third countries where the amount of space per bird is much smaller than what we currently have in the European Union. This directive requires a great deal of effort from European producers, as in Spain alone, it is understood that the cost is around EUR 600 million. It should also not be forgotten that it has an economic impact that extends to the egg products industry and the food industry in general. I therefore ask for your support for the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to paragraph 2, which asks for a solution to be found at least for responsible farms and responsible businesses that are in the process of transforming their farms and will have completed that transformation by January 2012. We need to support them in transforming their facilities and give them time to complete that process, thus preventing farms from suffering irreparable damage and preventing an overnight shortage in the EU market, which will consequently increase prices for consumers. We need to respect the directive, give the egg and egg products industries a chance and also respect the right to animal welfare and the right of consumers to a reasonable price.

Commissioner, thank you very much for being here and for having shown so much sensitivity regarding this very important parliamentary initiative that is so necessary for the European livestock sector. The sector is particularly vulnerable to the crises affecting EU agriculture as a whole, due to multiple factors: the high costs of inputs, the fall in market prices, imbalances of power in the food chain and the current increase in cereal prices. The European livestock industry has to deal with these problems just like other agricultural sectors, but with an aggravating factor: the large investments that are particular to this type of production. As the European Commission is on the verge of presenting its communication on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), I think this is a very good time to send a message of solidarity and concern to this group of producers. In my country, Spain, as in other EU countries, we are talking about a structural crisis, and the cereal price rises have just aggravated a situation that has been dragging on for several years now. The statistics show that a growing number of farms are being abandoned. However, this should not be the case in the context of global demand that will grow in the next few years thanks to the supposed improvement in people’s standard of living. With a view to the forthcoming CAP reform, what measures is the Commissioner, or the European Commission, planning, taking into account the specific nature of the livestock sector? I am talking about market measures, and other initiatives to prevent the models of intensive production that respect EU environmental standards being penalised by the future aid system, among other detrimental effects. Common-sense measures should be implemented that guarantee greater security of supply of livestock feed, the establishment of sufficient cereal reserves and the speeding up of the release of those reserves. Finally, to conclude, I would like to welcome the fact that this motion for a resolution makes special mention of pork and poultry, sectors that do not receive direct EU aid, but for which market and trade measures could also be established to alleviate their situation.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Cioloş that this report is essential and comes at the right time because it has demonstrated the abuses committed by mass distribution, severely disrupting the various links in the food chain. While the Bové report may go too far on some points by seeking to be too interventionist, it must be acknowledged that from the point of view of the social market economy that we advocate in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), it provides responses to the justified complaints made by European producers. It also brings transparency to the different parts of the food chain, which is always a good thing, offers the weakest sectors in the chain much more opportunities to defend themselves and, of course, supports European consumers in becoming more informed about that food chain. The European food industry could perhaps have been taken into account to a greater extent in this report, which would have been a good thing, but the report does also include measures for curbing the volatility of prices, which was very necessary. It also sets out measures for achieving equality between the links in the chain, as requested by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and it also asks for abusive and unfair practices in mass distribution to be combated. The time is now coming to establish a list of abusive practices to be strictly banned by European legislation. It is also important that measures be set out for preventing difficult practices through private labels that go against competition and intellectual property law. For all these reasons, we should support the Bové report, and all our fellow Members in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, who have worked hard to ensure that this report was finally published to help European producers move forwards.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the next few months we will be entering into a full debate on the new common agricultural policy (CAP). It is important to reach a satisfactory agreement, and so I hope that the Belgian Presidency manages to achieve what the Spanish Presidency did not. I hope that the Belgian Presidency can direct discussions in such a way that the Member States commit themselves to maintaining a truly strong CAP in the future, with a sufficient budget for meeting the needs of the 27 Member States, both new and old; I also hope that it will not be as it was in 2005, when there was a lack of money and a modulation had to be improvised. In the upcoming reform of the CAP, we are gambling with the viability of a sector that not only provides intangible goods and services, such as care for the environment, but must also guarantee the supply of food to the European public. We have witnessed distressing shortage situations in the past, which is why the European Parliament should make security of supply based on EU production the main objective of the next reform, without leaving aside other contributions, such as the fight against climate change. Esther Herranz García,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Madam President, to be honest, the first thing I wanted to do this evening is to thank Mr Scottà for his excellent skill in negotiating this report. It has been a real pleasure working with him and with the other spokespeople for the parliamentary groups. We are proud of the position that will be demonstrated tomorrow in the vote in Parliament and on a report such as this, which defends quality and which commits to the development and enhancement of rural areas, not only as mere evidence of a traditional European culture, but as true wealth- and job-creation agents. These are jobs that we currently need so much at this time of economic crisis and such a dramatic situation in terms of levels of employment in some Member States. In addition, we are pleased with the protection maintained by Parliament and the position already maintained by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as it has made clear, in committing to quality of the highest standard. With regard to that highest standard, moreover, we naturally commit to maintaining that differentiation between Protected Designation of Origin and Protected Geographical Indication. Of course, we reject ideas of levelling quality downwards and we want EU production to receive attention and be valued. I am delighted at what Mr Cioloş had to say. It was, of course, pleasing to hear him speak about commitment to the future of the European farming environment. We naturally hope he will listen to Parliament’s voice, which will be reflected tomorrow in the vote. Finally, I would like to say let us hope that it never happens again that the European Commission gets ahead of Parliament by prohibiting things such as, for example, marketing standards for fruit and vegetables, that have caused such damage to European free competition. We want the imbalances in the market corrected and we also want to commit to quality, variety, food safety and the right quantity of production. In addition, we want EU production and the quality of that EU agricultural and food production to be defended in the World Trade Organisation. We are, of course, also relying on the work of Mr Cioloş for that, because neither our European producers nor our European consumers can go on being defenceless. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs McGuinness on this initiative, which demonstrates the important role that the common agricultural policy (CAP) plays in meeting food provision needs internationally. Now that the European Commission seems to want to reduce the burden of the CAP on the Community budget, it is important to stress that while the CAP may not be a priority, food sufficiency must be. In past decades, it has been clear that without the CAP, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve food sufficiency. Agriculture cannot, therefore, be compared with other sectors of the economy which are able to thrive in a free market, because the food market is not a free market. Farmers need the support of the European Union in order for their businesses to succeed, and the European Union, in turn, needs farmers in order to maintain an agricultural model that is capable of providing sufficient food of sufficient quality to its increasingly demanding citizens. I therefore believe that we must change the course of the CAP, but not abolish it. In order to do this, direct aid must be guaranteed to farmers and a policy of managing agricultural markets must be restored to bring about greater price stability, which would benefit not only farmers but also consumers and third countries. A framework of best practices should be established in order to encourage balanced relations between the different players in the food chain, avoiding abusive practices and promoting fairer distribution of commercial margins. In addition, a European consumer information policy that highlights efforts by Community producers to comply with European Union regulations in the areas of the environment, food security and animal welfare is needed, since Community producers have to compete with imports from third countries, where the standards applied are much lower. Third-country producers prefer to export to the European Union rather than supplying their own countries’ markets because such exports are more profitable under World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements. Esther Herranz García,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, the European Union imposes on Community producers the highest standards in the world in terms of food security, health, animal welfare and the environment. European stockbreeders are obliged to meet these standards as a prerequisite for receiving European Union support. For the vast majority, this support does not offset the increased burden, and farms are being abandoned at an alarming rate. This process will continue unless adequate measures are taken. Let us, however, examine the issue more closely. The growing deficit in European production is naturally being covered by imports from third countries, mainly from Brazil. Given the pressure on Community stockbreeders, it would be totally dishonest to allow consignments of meat to enter the Community market if they failed to meet the minimum requirements agreed by the European Union with third countries. I would also like to highlight the fact that these requirements are lower that those imposed on our own farmers, because it would seem that imposing exactly the same standards on third-country imports would go against World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Given that the WTO prevents us from imposing the same standards on imports as we do on European stockbreeders, however, the Commission must, at the very least, guarantee that all meat that crosses Community borders comes from farms that have undergone adequate inspections. It would make no sense to block imports from countries like Brazil, since there is a Community demand which must be met. Nonetheless, this does not justify closing our eyes and looking the other way in the face of any irregularities that the European Union’s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) might detect during its regular inspections. I would like to know why the Commission is so keen to downplay these irregularities given that the FVO, on its last mission to Brazil, confirmed that some certification authorities do not meet the necessary inspection standards. The FVO also found huge flaws in the traceability system used by Brazil and detected problems with many consignments in transit to the European Union that did not have the necessary certificates. In view of this information, how can it be guaranteed that the 1 500 Brazilian farms do fulfil the agreed requirements? Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, you ended your speech by saying that there is a crisis in the milk sector, and yet you started by saying that all possible measures have already been taken and that the situation is being sorted out. You should know that it takes a wise woman to recognise that she was wrong. That is a saying in Spain, which could very well be applied to this situation. For months the milk sector has been suffering one of the worst crises in its history. Despite that, because the European Commission and certain governments – seemingly including my own, the Spanish Government – do not want to allow their arms to be twisted, they are refusing to go back on the decisions relating to the health check of the common agricultural policy. Those decisions were taken without any thought for the fragility of this sector, and in a market context very different from the one that has developed since that compromise was agreed. It makes you think that the Member States did not want to see, or could not see, at that time, the storm that was approaching. The reform has very quickly become irrelevant, due to the major turnaround in the market, which demonstrates that the sector is totally at the mercy of price volatility. The fact that major producers such as France and Germany – countries which, in absolute terms, obtained the biggest increase in their national production quotas in this agreement – are now the ones asking for a review of the health check decisions raises a lot of issues. As I see it, the Member States were wrong and should have listened more carefully to the voices, including mine, which were calling for any final decision on the future of the sector to be postponed until 2011. It is a shame that no one listened to us. Perhaps you should do so now. Eva Ortiz Vilella  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the President of the Court of Auditors for his presentation and the Commissioner for his statement.  The figures show that a number of issues need to be examined and we all – Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control, the President of the Court of Auditors and the Commission – need to attend very carefully to our own areas of responsibility, to ensure that we always achieve the best possible results.  Furthermore, the Member States have a very important role to play and must take on a task that, in my opinion, is vital if we are to succeed in ensuring that the results achieved and the image we convey when allocating funds are as good as they can possibly be. It is all the more important that money is spent soundly since that is why we are all here. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, in the last decade, one of the Union’s greatest successes has undoubtedly been the enlargement process. There is a series of principles that must govern, or must continue to govern, that process. I am referring to consolidation, conditionality and communication with the citizens. Another important prerequisite is the EU’s integration capacity. Does this principle still apply, as Ms Koppa’s report rightly suggests? Will we have resources in the future to finance the common policies or cohesion? I ask this because far-reaching cuts are being proposed for the new financial perspective, precisely in the funds for those policies, and others, too. Is that the European Union that we want in the future? Is that the way to prepare for future enlargements? Paradoxically, sometimes the greatest defenders of enlargement are those who most want to reduce the EU budget. We are also seeing the difficulty of having 27 Member States when taking decisions to tackle the serious crisis and strengthen the economic and monetary union. Sometimes, it takes a great deal of time to apply political decisions and that does not set a good example for future enlargements. It is possible that some of our own citizens cannot understand either how the European Union, with so many difficulties, will be able to cope with new enlargement challenges. I would add a small point: I am very pleased that the Koppa report incorporates the idea of creating a specific curricular element on the Union in secondary schools. It is the best way for young generations to find out about the Union and learn more about the enlargement process. My last point is that I cannot support the removal of the footnote from paragraph 28; it is the same formulation as that used by the Council and the Commission. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, given that foreign and security policy is such a broad subject, I shall focus on three basic ideas. Firstly, the EU’s external action should be ambitious. I want the European Union to be a major player in a global, complex, increasingly multipolar world, and it is also possible that we shall soon see something of a withdrawal in the external action of the United States. Secondly, size counts in foreign policy; as Europeans, we are stronger together than apart, and this ambitious perspective for Europe is reflected in Mr Brok’s solid report, which we shall adopt tomorrow. Thirdly, the Treaty of Lisbon provided new tools for this policy. I am referring to the position you hold, Baroness Ashton, as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Vice-President of the Commission. As you also chair the Foreign Affairs Council, it will now be easier to achieve unity, continuity and consistency in the Union’s foreign policy. In addition, you have a new instrument, the European External Action Service, into which diplomats from Member States have been incorporated, who will use their experience in foreign policy to enrich a vision that is more focused on issues related to economics, trade and cooperation by officials from the Commission. Finally, a true EU foreign policy not only takes time but also needs two basic conditions to be met: the new bodies of the Treaty of Lisbon should be ambitious, working with the purpose of leading the 27 Member States, not just accompanying them or finding lowest common denominators; secondly, the Member States should be aware of the need to work together on foreign policy, acting in a spirit of compromise and taking a constructive approach.

Mr President, I welcome the fact that the recent presidential elections in Egypt took place without any major problems and that the results have been accepted, but I think it is clear that those elections and the unexpected decisions taken by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces a few days before demonstrate that, in reality, there is a dual power structure in Egypt. These are delicate times. I believe it is essential that these two centres of power have dialogue and cooperate during this phase and launch an ordered transition towards normal democracy. I welcome the fact that it appears that the government soon to be elected by President Morsi will be a broad government representing broad sectors of the plural society that Egypt has. It will also be important to draw up a new constitution. I trust that it will establish a multi-party democratic system that respects human rights, including the rights of minorities. We cannot forget, as other speakers have said, the importance of the Christian minority, whose rights must be fully respected without discrimination. Egypt, ladies and gentlemen, is a key country in the Arab world and the whole region. What happens there will have repercussions on the rest of the Muslim world. Egypt can set an example, as Mr Pöttering said. It is also very important for the Egyptian political leaders to be aware of the need for their decisions not to destabilise the region, which has suffered numerous conflicts. I welcome the fact that the current international commitments are going to be honoured. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union cannot be removed from what is happening in Egypt. I repeat, it is a very important country, in our Mediterranean neighbourhood. We must support this transition and try to help where we can, without, of course, failing to defend our values and interests. Finally, I would like to express my support for the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which has been suffering a difficult situation in Egypt for months. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, this is a time of significant change in the Middle East. I will briefly discuss three points: Changes are afoot in Egypt with the forthcoming presidential elections. I would like them to be clean, to take place without incident, and for the parties and society to accept the results. I would certainly have liked the Egyptian authorities to have invited European observers. Egypt is a key country in the Arab world. It is important for a multi-party system to be consolidated there in which the prosperity and freedoms of the Egyptian people are the main objective. Living together in tolerance, rather than radicalism or polarisation, will allow all Egyptians to exercise freedoms, including religious freedom. What are your hopes, Baroness Ashton, for these elections? In Israel, I would like the broader base of the new government to favour the opening of negotiations with the Palestinians, but I am sceptical about the launching of negotiations this year due to the continuing problem of the settlements, which you referred to along with the regional and international context, including the electoral outlook in the United States. Another reason I am sceptical is the way that Israel is focusing on the Iranian nuclear programme. However, I do not think that the deadlock is helping anyone. I do not think that the changes that have taken place in the region are going to provide Israel with a more favourable context in future for resuming the negotiations. I will end by discussing Syria. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, things are not improving there, as has already been stated. Kofi Annan’s plan is not succeeding. The violence is only increasing, and is even seriously affecting children, and Kofi Annan’s plan is not supporting the opposition. I am afraid that President al-Assad’s government thinks that it can crush the revolution by force, and that in the end, the international community will accept it. It is essential that Russia and China place more pressure on the Syrian authorities to change their attitude. I would like you to tell us, Baroness Ashton, whether, at the recent summit with Russia at the weekend, you were able to glean whether there is any desire in Moscow to adjust its position. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, the consolidation of democracy, human rights and the rule of law is particularly important in our neighbourhood – taken from Article 8 of the Treaty on European Union – and Ukraine is a neighbouring country to Europe, with which we have concluded negotiations on an association agreement, and one which has what we call ‘European prospects’. For that reason, therefore, there needs to be a strong demand for human rights. I am worried about the lack of political will from the Ukrainian authorities on this matter. This is emphasised with the case of Ms Yulia Tymoshenko and also other opposition leaders, victims of selective justice and a penal code from the Soviet era, as previously mentioned. It appears that their ambiguity means that there is almost no difference between political and penal responsibility. A democratic system cannot function in this manner. Fundamental rights need to be protected, and opposition politics logically have to be respected. In addition, I think it would be very convenient if the European Union could reach a unanimous view on the level and manner in which high-ranking politicians are going to attend the European Football Championships that are to be played in Ukraine next month. And, lastly, ladies and gentlemen, I was somewhat surprised to read that the President of this House entertained the Prime Minister of Ukraine last week. Given that neither the Council nor the Commission went to such lengths, I wonder whether our coordination within the institutions of the Union is appropriate, and I would like Mr Füle, the Commissioner, to tell me if this coordination exists.

 Madam President, first of all, Baroness Ashton, I would like to thank you for what you said about the arbitrary and unlawful expropriation that the Repsol company in Argentina is undergoing. This measure goes against international law and the principle of legal certainty that affects all Europeans. I welcome your response and, once again, I thank you for your words, Baroness Ashton. I would now like to talk about the Howitt report. Articles 3 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union show very clearly that human rights are an extremely important part of the EU’s external relations. That is because the rule of law and human rights are a constituent part, so to speak, of this Union and its Member States, but also because in today’s world, the international community as a whole considers that human rights are universal and indivisible, and that defending them can no longer be hindered by the old principle of non-interference in Member States’ internal affairs. The report we shall vote on tomorrow shows how important human rights are for Parliament; this can be clearly seen, I believe, from the Sakharov Prize that we created in this House many years ago, and also from the support we are giving to the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. Ladies and gentlemen, respect for human rights is a highly topical issue. This can be seen from the brand new role being created, which will be responsible for protecting human rights, and from the changes and revolutions that broke out last year in the Arab world – one of the main goals of which was to recover human dignity and respect for human rights. Baroness Ashton, we must all do our utmost – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – so that those political processes can consolidate the noble aspirations for which they were initiated, and so that the expectation of freedom, pluralism, tolerance and respect for minorities is not jeopardised.

 On behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we want to declare that our vote on the resolution on the European integration process of Kosovo is based on the fact that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it was a normal independent state, recognised by the international community, and does not take into account that the status of this territory continues to be controversial. It has yet to be recognised by a majority of countries, five of which are Member States of the European Union, including Spain. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to focus on three points regarding Turkey’s accession to the European Union. The first of these is its visa policy for third country nationals. Speaking two years ago in Parliament, I expressed my surprise that Turkey did not bring this policy into line with that of the European Union. According to the European Commission’s 2011 Progress Report, Turkey has recently signed visa waiver agreements with Sudan and Yemen. I have also been informed that Iranian, Libyan, Lebanese and Syrian nationals do not require visas either. Last week, a very widely read Spanish newspaper claimed that Turkey’s visa exemption for some countries, together with its land border, which runs for thousands of kilometres, make the country a corridor of choice for organised crime. In my opinion, Turkey should make a serious effort and progressively bring itself into line with the Union’s visa policy. It is part of the acquis. It should align itself with Europe rather than continuing on its current line, which takes it in the opposite direction, distancing it from European Union policy. It should progressively align itself, and I believe that the Commission should carefully monitor this matter. Secondly, I think political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey should be closer. Turkey has recently become close to the Arab world. It occupies a very significant position in a region that is very close and very important to Europe, and which is undergoing major changes. Dialogue and cooperation between Brussels and Ankara would be very positive. Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the range of reforms that Turkey has introduced, and I hope it pursues them with determination and strength, as the report that we will approve tomorrow calls on it to do.

 Mr President, talking of enlargement encourages optimism. No Member State wishes to leave the Union; on the contrary, there are a number of states who wish to join, Iceland among them. I welcome its desire for integration and the rapid pace of adhesion negotiations. I say adhesion because that is what it is, adhering to and accepting the European Union acquis
. In the negotiations, efforts are continuing to define the adaptations that the candidate country needs to make to adopt the acquis
 and the timescale for this. In the Commission’s report of October 2011, we were told that as yet, there had been no changes to Icelandic legislation on fisheries, and that it is not in line with the EU acquis
, nor are the current restrictions on foreign investment in fisheries consistent with the acquis
: they infringe fundamental principles, like the right of establishment and the free movement of capital and services. Iceland is a major fishing nation, like my own country, Spain and my region, the Autonomous Community of Galicia. Iceland’s accession will strengthen the fisheries sector within the Union, but, Mr President, it cannot remain outside EU law in this sector. I am asking the Commission to pay the closest attention to this issue. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, Russia is very important to the European Union both as a neighbouring European country and as a global actor and permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. This is why we would like to have a closer relationship with Russia so that we can address issues of mutual interest and for reasons of global governance. However, there are obstacles to such a close relationship. We regret Russia’s behaviour during the Syrian crisis, and certain recent events, like December’s elections to the Duma, and the presidential elections on 4 March, have left us feeling disappointed and concerned. The elections did not conform to the democratic standards of a European country which is a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE. As I have said, it is in our interests to have a relationship of mutual trust with Russia, but the fundamental basis of this relationship should be shared democratic values, joint respect for human rights, the multi-party system and respect for the democratic opposition. The modern Russia we want to see is a Russia which shares European values. We can build the close relationship we want on the basis of these values. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Russia is an important neighbour for the EU, for both geographical and historical reasons, and it is also a very significant economic and energy partner. Furthermore, it is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Russia is one of the actors needed for efficient global governance capable of dealing with global problems, and we also need increased cooperation from Russia on issues such as the situation in Syria, which is on the brink of civil war, or the nuclear threat from Iran. I believe, however, that the EU wants a relationship with Russia that goes beyond those global or regional interests. Russia is a European neighbour, and a member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. I believe that we would like a relationship of real trust and friendship with Russia, based on shared values and principles. That is why we want a new association agreement and why we want for Russia what we also demand of ourselves: a pluralistic democratic regime that respects civil and political freedoms, and a rule of law in which corruption and arbitrariness are the exception. However, the organisation of the legislative elections in December did nothing to strengthen that trust. The irregularities of the election process are well known, as are the serious accusations made. I hope that the next presidential elections will not show the same shortcomings, and that Russia can finally start to move towards clear democratic progress and modernity, which is what its European partners wish for.

 Madam President, our ‘southern’ neighbourhood is going through a new phase in its history, from which there is no way back. The European Union must support these processes of democratic change, drastically altering its former complacency, which gave the impression of aiming for stability but was nothing more than inertia. As Article 8 of the Treaty of Lisbon states, our neighbourhood policy should be based on universal values such as human dignity, human rights, democracy and the rule of law, as well as having conditions and specific requirements, since not all processes are the same. There should be country-specific procedures in each case. In any event, we must embark upon dialogue with new political groups, including moderate Islamist forces, based on the values mentioned previously. We should strengthen our relations with these countries, their political and social forces and their civil societies. This is a job for the EU institutions and also for European political and social groups. Aside from the political support, we must provide economic and financial aid to these countries. Commercial opening should be gradual. It should be mutually beneficial and include the services sector, as called for by the report. We should also prioritise the administrative and institutional development of several of our neighbours to the south and help them in the fight against corruption and organised crime. I would also like to see the Union for the Mediterranean find sufficient resources to put some of the identified projects into action. These issues and many more, Madam President – and I am finishing now – are covered in the extensive report written by my brilliant colleague, Mário David, which we will be voting on tomorrow. I am sure, Mr Füle, that you and the Commission services will find it a very useful read. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, Europe and the United States are going through a severe economic crisis. Both our economies are very interconnected and during the next summit, we have to commit to act in a more coordinated manner and to implement the commitments that were made at the G20. In a globalised economy, the solutions should be global, but it is also necessary for everyone to fulfil their responsibilities in their own area. The United States should reduce its trade and fiscal deficits and China should revaluate its currency. We Europeans should finally solve the Greek crisis and the sovereign debt issues in several of our countries. Otherwise, we would not have any credibility as effective partners. The fleeting presence of President Obama in Europe to attend the G20 meeting in Cannes contrasts with the time he is dedicating to the Asia-Pacific region this week. It appears to symbolise the rise of Asia and the decline of Europe. It is not only economic challenges that we Europeans and Americans have to tackle, however, but also many others: climate change, nuclear proliferation, energy, terrorism, poverty; and regional issues such as the Arab Spring and the conflict in the Middle East. We should consult and coordinate and stop the concept of the ‘West’ or the ‘transatlantic community’ increasingly losing value to Asia’s benefit. Asia should also take part in global governance, but not by taking the role of Europe. For that we need a true Europe, a solid European Union, an efficient global player, and not a fragile set of countries that do not know how to resolve the sovereign debt crisis. This is what the United States expects and is also what our citizens want. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).

 Mr President, religious freedom is recognised in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and also in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Egypt has been a State Party since 1982. Moreover, we know how important freedom of demonstration and expression is. The seriousness of what happened on 9 October 2011 in Cairo lies in the fact that disproportionate force was used against demonstrators who were part of a minority demanding protection for their religious freedom. There needs to be a rigorous investigation into what took place, and the guilty parties should be punished, as Mr Pöttering quite rightly said. Ms Ashton, religious freedom must be protected, and all countries must respect it, as this Parliament called for in its resolution of 20 January 2011. We want an Egypt of freedom, justice and peace; an Egypt that keeps its distance from events such as these. What is more, Egypt is a great country and a leader in the Arab world: what goes on there has major repercussions. Recent events cannot happen again. Egypt should be an example of tolerance and harmony, not one of violence and violated freedoms. The EU should do its utmost to see that freedoms are respected during the transitions taking place in the Arab world, which we wish to promote and accompany. In recent months, Christian leaders and representatives of civil society expressed their concern to me over the situation regarding religious freedom in their particular countries. Baroness Ashton, I would like you to keep us informed of the measures you intend to propose in order to strengthen the action taken by the EU in this area, as the Foreign Affairs Council asked you to do in February. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we debated the peace process here over six months ago. I stressed at that time that there was an urgent need to re-start talks because time was not in favour of either of the two parties. I can understand how the stalling of the process has prompted the Palestinians to take the initiative and to raise the issue of their admission to the United Nations. We are now in a very complex situation. I suppose that this matter will eventually be passed from the Security Council to the General Assembly. I would like the European Union and its Member States to play an active role and for the Twenty-Seven to be united in stating an opinion on the resolution that will eventually be put to the vote. There are no simple solutions: no simple yes and no simple no. The General Assembly’s resolution must be careful. It must not imperil the peace process or put either of the two sides, or the other players who are the main promoters of the process, into impossible situations. However, a failure to act must not be an option. Ladies and gentlemen, today, unfortunately, just like six months ago, I cannot be optimistic about the progress of the talks. The news we have received today about new settlements in Jerusalem is, frankly, very bad. In addition, I fear that some of the 2012 elections will not help lead to a solution. The situation could be better in 2013, but I would be sorry to have lost a year, particularly given the current dynamics of change in the Arab world. These are times of historic responsibility for the two sides, and also for the international community. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, Lady Ashton, I share your view that the EU must give its attention as a matter of priority to the southern Mediterranean, which is going through a period of extraordinary changes. I am delighted that the recent referendum in Morocco has adopted the reform promoted by King Mohammed VI. It would be good if changes at a constitutional level were accompanied by reforms in economic and social matters in order to reduce inequalities. Contrary to what is happening in Morocco, we are receiving bad news from Syria and, unfortunately, the end of the Gaddafi regime has not yet been brought about in Libya. We must remain involved in these processes, and also in Egypt and Tunisia. It is very important that we go along with the changes that are taking place in the region and we must ensure that the values of liberty, justice, democracy and respect for human rights, including freedom of conscience and religion and also gender equality, prevail. Positive conditionality or, what amounts to the same thing, the more for more strategy, should assist this as well as strengthen relations with civil society. Ladies and gentlemen, I am concluding. I hope, moreover, that the Union for the Mediterranean is finally able to act after a period of paralysis. Furthermore, as of yesterday, it has a new Secretary General, whom I wish success in the complex management of the Union. Let us hope that projects identified some three years ago can be set in motion and so contribute to improving the economy in the Mediterranean countries. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, I, too, of course, would like to add my support for the residents of Lorca. In this debate about education, I want to reiterate an important point: the need to include in secondary school studies a specific subject covering the history, aims and workings of the European Union. I have already talked about this issue in the last term, in plenary, after the failure of Constitutional Treaty referenda. Fortunately, last year in this House, the Løkkegaard report on journalism and new media, approved in September, supported the introduction of this subject in paragraph 13. I myself submitted an amendment in this regard. Recently in Spain, the Valencia regional government decided to include a subject for the next academic year. It is an initiative that other regions and countries should follow. I understand that the Commission, of course, supports and welcomes initiatives of this type. Ladies and gentlemen, we only value, we only appreciate … (The President cut off the speaker) Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to start with two initial observations. I prefer individual debates to a joint debate. We are dealing with separate issues, which deserve independent and in-depth discussion. Meanwhile, I would like to echo the words of Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra about the death of the Cuban dissident, Mr Soto. Please allow me to make three additional comments. Unfortunately, when all of us were hoping we could focus on the European Union’s external role these years, the serious economic and financial crisis has been taking up all our efforts. However, a great number of external challenges, particularly in our Mediterranean neighbourhood, mean we cannot afford to wait. The European Union must have a political and economic presence in the processes of change taking place in the Arab world. I am also celebrating, Baroness Ashton, the fact that the European Union’s voice in the United Nations General Assembly was finally strengthened in New York last week as the result of a vote that received widespread support. I congratulate you on that, given that last year’s disaster raised worrying questions about the future role of the Union in the world and in international organisations. However, the divergent European votes on Resolution 1973 of the United Nations Security Council highlight the enormous difficulties – I stress, enormous difficulties – involved in achieving an effective common security and defence policy. To summarise, Baroness Ashton, you and Mr Van Rompuy, who also has many responsibilities in foreign matters, have the huge task of convincing the Member States of the need for unified and coherent external action. The two of you will have to work hard to push, drag and lead, at a moment in history that we had intended to tackle with the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 – (ES)
 Madam President, Commissioner, I regret the Council’s absence in today’s debate. With regard to the Southern Neighbourhood, I shall make three points. Firstly, the European Union must support and facilitate the processes of democratic change. In the past, neighbouring authorities used their concerns over stability as a way of justifying their inaction. Secondly, I wish for economic prosperity for our southern neighbours; this requires a great deal of reforms, investments, and financial and economic aid, as well as trade, not just with the North, but also South-South trade, which is currently non-existent. I am concerned about the line being taken by the Commission and the High Representative, Mrs Ashton: in an article published in The New York Times on 18 March 2011, she appears to be advising those countries to specialise in agricultural exports to European markets. I disagree. Commissioner Füle is well aware of this, although he seems to be shaking his head. These countries need diversified economies and agriculture. I repeat: diversified. They also need to attend to their domestic food needs and not restrict themselves to a few export products which, in addition, cause concern for European farmers. We therefore need common sense and prudence on this issue. Thirdly, we need to revitalise the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and its projects, which can help in the economic modernisation of the Mediterranean countries. Unfortunately, the UfM is still in deadlock, there is no General Secretary, and it cannot continue to be hijacked by the lack of progress between Israel and Palestine. Ladies and gentlemen, we are facing a major challenge. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, as indicated in the Middle East Quartet Statement made in Munich, we would all like to see the end of negotiations between Israel and Palestine in September 2011 in the form of an agreed solution for the two states that will bring peace and security. Unfortunately, the prospects are not rosy. With only six months left, negotiations have come to a standstill, stalled over the question of the settlements. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that the loss of valuable time will benefit Israel, nor will it contribute to finding a successful solution. On the one hand, I am concerned that it will become ever harder to find moderate leaders in Palestine with enough political support to be able to conclude agreements with Israel, which is no easy task. On the other hand, if the settlements remain, it will become ever harder to create a truly viable Palestine state. Lady Ashton, I agree that the peace process should not be put on hold because of political upheaval in the region. If the current events result in democratic regimes, as we all hope, regimes that will listen to the wishes of the people, the climate in the region will become even less propitious for Israel. It may be that Israel will become even more isolated and come under greater pressure from some of its Arab neighbours. In conclusion, everyone, including Israel, would benefit from reaching a solution as soon as possible. I would therefore urge the European Union to contribute actively to restarting the peace process in close cooperation with the United States and the other Quartet members. Lady Ashton, I hope that there will be a high-level Quartet meeting this month, as set out in the Munich Statement. Can you confirm whether that will be the case? Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, I am very pleased that the Commission is preparing a communication on the European strategy for the Atlantic region. This is a region that has two major, related characteristics: its oceanic-maritime nature and its peripheral character. I will make four points. Firstly, I would stress the importance of its maritime aspect, because of which, the strategy must attach importance to the preservation of the marine environment, fishing, the environment, energies related to this marine environment, and tourism. Secondly, given the peripheral nature of the region, transport – so-called ‘connectivity’ – is very important, both between the areas that make up the Atlantic region and, above all, with the rest of the European Union. The trans-European transport networks, the highways of the sea and energy connections must be given priority. With regard to Galicia, my constituency, I also have in mind the high-speed connection with the north of Portugal and the Transcantábrico train. Thirdly, Commissioner, I believe that the strategy must not focus solely on maritime issues. It must, as Mr Cadec has said, have a significant land-based dimension which includes the objectives of social, economic and territorial cohesion. As the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow indicates, the strategy for the Atlantic region must be closely connected with the Europe 2020 strategy, and with regional development policy and future economic prospects. Finally, the various administrations and organisations that exist in the Atlantic region must be taken closely into account, including the regional government of Galicia and the Euroregion created with the neighbouring community of North Portugal, which were amongst the first in the European Union to create a European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation. All of this means that there is a need for the Commission to maintain a permanent dialogue with these regions and entities, during both the development of the strategy and its subsequent implementation. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, we need further clarification on the Supreme Military Council’s plans in Egypt. One specific undertaking is the holding of democratic elections within six months, following a constitutional reform led by experts. However, I have also read that next week we will see a new government supposedly including opposition representatives, according to the British Foreign Secretary. I think we all agree, in any case, that the best way forward is to have a transitional process, supported by the widest possible political consensus, until the elections are held. It would also be desirable for the social forces to work together to ensure that this transition is unburdened by major tensions. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union must support the democratic process and contribute to its success. Egypt is a key country, and developments there will be felt throughout the Mediterranean and the Arab world. I therefore welcome Baroness Ashton’s visit to Cairo next week. One further point: The Tunisians and the Egyptians have given us a lesson in the people’s desire for freedom. I hope the foreign ministers will not overlook this lesson when they come to assess the common position on Cuba, which is precisely aimed at attaining a democratic transition in that country, and which defends those who defend freedom. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Madam President, the events taking place in Tunisia and Egypt are very significant and it is possible that these processes of change will spread to other countries in the Mediterranean region, which is a region of the highest importance to the European Union. These countries are right on our doorstep and we have numerous strong ties of friendship with them. In the last decade, the European Union has been unable to persuade their authorities to undertake the necessary reforms. In the last parliamentary term I myself stressed that stability could not continue to be used to justify a lack of change, but rather that these countries needed profound political, economic and social reforms. Now change and reform are being demanded by the people on the streets. Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that the Council finally paid attention to these events on Monday and has taken a position. I too have the impression that the transition process in Tunisia is headed in the right direction. However, the wider perception is, unfortunately, that the European Union has been almost absent from these processes in recent weeks. We have heard several speeches by President Obama, we have heard statements from Secretary of State Clinton, and we have even heard about contact between the Tunisian Army and representatives of the US Army… The Union’s visibility has been in no way comparable. The Treaty of Lisbon’s new mechanisms should have been more active and visible, including the President of the European Council. Baroness Ashton, I welcome your trip to Tunisia in two weeks’ time, but I also believe that we must improve our capacities for prediction and reaction. Do we want to be a major global player? We need to start with being relevant at regional level, as a minimum. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, this debate is very necessary given the recent serious events that are affecting the religious freedom and even the lives of Christians. I am particularly referring to what has happened mainly in Pakistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Egypt. Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights sets out in great detail what it calls freedom of religion or religious freedom. Despite this, it is, unfortunately, a right that is little respected in some countries. We are now even seeing that those who profess the Christian faith can pay for it with their lives. Baroness Ashton, the European Union must robustly defend the right to religious freedom in general, clearly incorporating it into its external action and demanding respect, freedom and security for what is now the most persecuted religious group in the world, the Christian community. We must demand that all the governments concerned do what is necessary to prevent these attacks, and when that is not possible, to arrest and punish those responsible. Ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, freedom is a symbol of European identity, and that includes religious freedom, which is part of the basic core of human rights. That freedom is also a path to peace, as Pope Benedict XVI said in his message on 1 January. I would also like to highlight the essential role of Christianity in shaping the European identity. It would therefore be a sad paradox if the European Union did not demand as firmly as possible that the world protect the most basic rights of Christians and did not help them where it could. The European Parliament resolution sets out methods for better defending religious freedom in general and the freedom of Christians in particular. I welcome the fact that the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council is to give them close consideration, and – I am finishing now, Mr President – that the forthcoming European Council on 14 February is to give its opinion on these serious events, just as, for example, President Sarkozy very courageously did. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, this debate on Libya is taking place at a time when very significant changes are happening in another neighbouring Mediterranean country: Tunisia. I have always believed that the European Union must help to promote serious reforms in the Mediterranean region, with the aim of making it an area of freedom and prosperity. I refer to my speeches in this House in recent years, in which I have repeatedly said that the Union’s policy cannot be focused on simply maintaining the status quo
. This is not, however, the specific issue being debated today, which is the Framework Agreement with Libya. I would like to stress the need to cooperate with Libya in managing migratory flows, including an agreement to readmit illegal immigrants including third-country nationals, as is the case in all readmission agreements concluded by the Union. Giving in to Libyan positions that are contrary to this agreement would be detrimental given Libya’s important position as a transit country, and it would also send a very negative message for the negotiations with Morocco and Algeria on readmission agreements, which have been in deadlock for many years. However, we do also have to insist that the Libyan authorities respect the rights of refugees, including – as has already been said – the principle of non-refoulement. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would also like to express my concern regarding the impact of this agreement on the canned tuna fishing sector, which is very important in Spain and particularly in Galicia, my constituency. This negative impact is, as has been said, due to an unprecedented and ill-founded concession: the exemption from the rules of origin for processed fish products, when requested, due to not having sufficient indigenous raw materials. That was the first thing that Papua New Guinea did, and the exemption is being applied. Papua New Guinea is thus becoming a major platform for the processing and export of tuna from the European industry’s major competitors: the Philippines, Thailand, China and the United States. It is really they who are the major beneficiaries of the agreement. It is estimated that this tuna production will ultimately amount to 400 000 tonnes per year, destined for the European market, which currently consumes a total of around 710 000 tonnes. The impact will be very serious, as the prices of the tuna from Papua New Guinea are one third lower than the price of European tuna, due to the country’s low wages and non-existent environmental standards. In my region, Galicia, this is considered to be unbeatable competition, which will have serious consequences for employment. I want the impact assessment announced by the European Commission to be as rigorous as possible and to take into account the short and medium-term consequences of this exemption from the rules of origin. I hope that it will put an end to the application of this exemption as soon as possible. It is an exceptional and temporary measure, but it appears that in Papua New Guinea, they consider it to be a permanent one: otherwise, the investments would not be made. I also hope that this exemption is not included in other agreements or in the final agreement. Currently, however, there is a problem with the provisional agreement, and it must be rectified. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, the Union’s most important strategic relationship is the one it has with the United States. We must maintain a continuous dialogue on bilateral issues and also on global issues, and try to ensure the most coordinated action possible. In my view, this is the main message of tomorrow’s resolution. I therefore regretted the fact that the planned summit in May was not held. Moreover, I found the argument given at the time that there was no agenda to be absurd. There is always an agenda between two partners that are so important and which are immersed in a global economic crisis, and when there are challenges such as terrorism, climate change, energy security or nuclear proliferation. Moreover, there are major regional conflicts, for example, the Middle East peace process, the Iranian nuclear challenge or the issue of Afghanistan, which, in my view, are worthy of coordinated action by the United States and the European Union. I hope that the forthcoming Lisbon summit will be a success. There are many issues to tackle, some of which I have already mentioned. Moreover, the world is changing. Asia is in the ascendancy; let us think about the importance of China or India, which President Obama has just visited. There is even talk of a post-Western world. In this context of a changing world order, we need close coordination between Europe and the United States. We have many interests, ideals and values in common. We will be stronger if we act in a coordinated way. Ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has also created new bodies to strengthen the Union’s role in the world. We should therefore also improve our mechanisms for dialogue and coordination with the United States. The resolution adopted by Parliament in March last year contains many ideas as to how to strengthen those institutional mechanisms for dialogue between Brussels and Washington. My final comment is that I regret the fact that the representative of the Council only referred to an exchange of data; he did not come here to talk about the summit, about which we heard nothing. Unfortunately, the Commission did so only very briefly. Who really came here to talk about the summit? Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I am really delighted that the European Council has discussed the Union’s external action. We are in a new world, which is multipolar from an economic point of view and increasingly from a political point of view, with a smaller number of significant players. Moreover, the challenges that we face are global ones. No country can face them alone, including the countries of the EU. As the President of the Commission said a few days ago, in a global world, size does matter. The European Union must be one of those players. I therefore regret the result of the vote in New York last week on strengthening the EU’s position in the United Nations. What happened is very concerning. I think it would be very good for careful preparations to be made in future for summits with the other major players. As well as tackling the way that the other players voted on 14 September in New York, they are also needed to tackle important bilateral and multilateral issues. Among other things, we need to govern globalisation, adapting the institutions that were established after the Second World War and strengthening more recent forums such as the G20. In doing all these things, I also think that we need to be working in harmony with the United States. We share many values and interests with them, and I trust that sound preparations are being made for the summit on 20 November. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union’s external action will have more continuity and consistency. However, along with the internal strength of the Union, the political will for joint action by the 27 is also essential, particularly among the most significant Member States. This process of uniting will inevitably be a long and difficult one. It is necessary, however, if we want to prevent Europe from being irrelevant and prevent what is beginning to be described as the advent of a post-Western era.

On behalf of the Spanish delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we would like to state that the reasoning behind our vote on the resolution on the process relating to the European integration of Kosovo is that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it were an independent state in an entirely normal situation, without taking into account the fact that the status of this territory continues to be very controversial within the international community – an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice is also pending – and Kosovo has not been recognised by five Member States of the European Union, including Spain.

Madam President, the importance of relations with Russia for the European Union is obvious: it is a powerful neighbour, a strategic economic and energy partner, and a permanent member of the Security Council. Russia now seems to be more peaceful and settled, thanks to the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the United States, overcoming its disagreement with the anti-missile shield and the agreements that it has reached with the new Ukrainian Government. Furthermore, the tension caused two years ago by its intervention in Georgia has decreased. In this new context, we all welcome Russia’s support of the recent Security Council Resolution 1929 on Iran. This is therefore a good time to improve relations with Russia. Consequently, Baroness Ashton, I regret the fact that there has not been any progress in the negotiation of the new partnership agreement with Russia that first requires Russia to join the World Trade Organisation, something that has also still not been clarified. Ladies and gentlemen, there needs to be an ambitious agreement that includes and regulates energy, investment and trade issues. Clear, legally binding rules are what is needed. Also, I do, of course, agree with the European Union supporting and helping Russia in its desire to modernise, but the Partnership for Modernisation, which was the framework for the relationship established at the recent summit, should not be an alternative to the aforementioned agreement. I certainly welcome the fact that the Presidency is including the effective functioning of the judicial system and stepping up the fight against corruption in that partnership. I will conclude now: what I also want is a single, efficient and coherent EU policy, and I hope that the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon – you yourself, High Representative, and the permanent President of the European Council – will help us to achieve this aim of a single, coherent policy.

Mr President, a preliminary clarification: in my view, either a representative of the Presidency of the Council, or, perhaps, of the current French co-presidency of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), should have spoken in this debate today; their absence is deeply regrettable. Ladies and gentlemen, it is a priority for the European Union to ensure that its closest neighbours form an area of peace, prosperity, freedom and security. This should be the primary objective of the UfM, which I hope is due to hold its second summit next month. I would like to congratulate Mr Peillon and to express my thanks, most especially, for his open-minded and extremely constructive approach. In spite of the proximity of the European Union to the southern shores of the Mediterranean, there are considerable differences separating us in economic, political, social, demographic and cultural terms, and so on. Some of these disparities are due to serious deficiencies in our neighbouring states. It is crucial to promote close dialogue and cooperation within the framework of the UfM, and to bring forward those major joint projects which it has identified, as well as the bilateral dimension of the association agreements, in order to strengthen the relationship between both shores and to be able to reduce these disparities. In order to achieve this, our neighbours, too, must implement reforms. Standing still cannot be an option. I would like briefly to raise three further points. Firstly, it is very important for the secretariat of the UfM in Barcelona to be fully operational as soon as possible. Secondly, and closely linked to the previous point, the UfM must not fall hostage to conflicts, such as that in the Middle East. The UfM can facilitate a solution but it does not claim to be the means to the solution nor should it be blocked by these confrontations. Thirdly and lastly, the UfM must also pay particular attention to what is known as Chapter Four of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation: migration, security, social integration and justice.

 Mr President, we are all concerned by the increase in violence in Ciudad Juarez, but I trust in the broad measures that the Mexican authorities have put in place in order to effectively tackle this complex situation. I also support the vigorous battle President Calderón is currently waging against drugs trafficking, which is a very serious global threat that concerns us all. That is why we should help the Mexican authorities in this difficult struggle. Ladies and gentlemen, over the past 10 years, Mexico has gone through a very positive process of political and governmental modernisation. President Calderón is steadily promoting reforms. Mexico has also taken on greater international responsibilities and is playing an active role within, for example, the United Nations and the G-20. In this Parliament, within my modest capabilities, I have always supported the establishment of a strategic partnership between the European Union and Mexico, which we finally achieved in 2008. I hope we can adopt an ambitious joint action plan or programme at the May Summit in Madrid, because the European Union and Mexico need to work together in many areas, both on a bilateral level and in multilateral forums, in order to confront challenges and threats together, including drugs trafficking and other forms of organised crime Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, the Union’s foreign policy is entering a new phase, as Baroness Ashton and Mr Albertini have said this morning. Article 21 of the treaty establishes objective principles. New positions are also created by the treaty, with a High Representative, a Vice-President of the Commission, a permanent President of the European Council, a European External Action Service, and a new Security and Defence Policy, which is the subject of the report by my colleague Mr Danjean, etc. These innovations aim to ensure that the European Union has a much more effective influence in the world, and I think that summits with third countries continue to be an ideal instrument for achieving this. The European Union does not hold many summits with individual countries, so we should take care with them. The summit held last week with Morocco was the first summit with an Arab country, and also symbolised advanced status being granted to Morocco. I would have liked you to have attended, Baroness Ashton. I also regret that the King of Morocco was not present. His absence meant that a summit that should have been historic lost political influence, significance and effectiveness. I hope that the Union for the Mediterranean Summit in Barcelona will also be successful in terms of the level of the delegations. I also regret the fact that the summit with President Obama planned for the spring is not going to take place. As the Albertini report states, the Treaty of Lisbon sets the stage for strengthening our mechanisms for dialogue with the United States. This and other subjects could have been dealt with at the summit. The European Union and the United States should not miss the opportunity to deal at a high level with the bilateral matters, conflicts and global challenges that are now mounting up on the world’s agenda. It would be paradoxical – and I will finish now – if now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, we ran the risk of becoming irrelevant in this world that some are now calling ‘post-Western’ or ‘post-American’.

Madam President, democracy and defending human rights have an important place among the Union’s principles and objectives for external action – I refer to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union. This Article also applies to relations with Cuba and with the Cuban people, who are very dear to us. Unfortunately, in the last five years, the Council’s actions appear to have been essentially governed by a desire to correct the line adopted in previous years, especially in 2003 when there was an extremely harsh wave of oppression in Cuba. In 2005, the Council suspended the 2003 measures. Subsequently, there were trips to the island by foreign ministers and commissioners. In June 2008, the 2003 measures were lifted and a global political dialogue was established – as Mr López Garrido reminded us – along with regular high-level meetings. A Head of State of a Member State even recently visited Havana. Unfortunately, the European political leaders who went to the island did not have any time to meet with the representatives of the dissidents, who therefore felt marginalised. Over all this time, repression in Cuba has continued. There have been no changes or reforms. Nevertheless, political dialogue has been maintained. Now we are all shaken up by the cruel death of the political prisoner, Orlando Zapata. As is well known, ladies and gentlemen, some governments, such as the Spanish Government, have repeatedly said that they want to cancel the common position. It says something very logical: support for democratic transition, essentially the same thing that is required by the principles and objectives of Article 21 of the treaty. I will conclude with two points. The common position has not hindered dialogue. This is obvious. What is more, it was reconfirmed recently by the 27 ministers, in June 2009. Secondly, the priority cannot be to change the common position – that would be the last straw! The priority now is to ask for the immediate, complete and unconditional release of all political prisoners. I see Cuba and Latin America as Western, and the symbols that identify the West are the dignity of human beings and respect for their fundamental rights. I have a final thought: I would like to remind the Council that, in its own conclusions in June 2009, it said that the future of political dialogue with the Cuban authorities was dependent on progress being made, in particular, on human rights. Can anyone say that this progress is taking place today? Can anyone really say that? Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, may I welcome the Commissioner. In this decade, enlargement policy has been the European Union’s greatest success, along with the euro. That policy should not be held back. Furthermore, we cannot break the commitments we have made with candidate countries, although we should also respect the well-known principles of consolidation and conditionality. We also should not forget the European Union's integration capacity or the need to communicate with citizens on the subject of enlargement and its advantages and consequences. Given the time restrictions, I shall just make a few brief comments. In principle, candidate countries should resolve beforehand any territorial disputes and similar issues they might have with each other and with Member States, so as not to later slow down the operation of the Union. In the case of Turkey, I would particularly like to highlight how important it is for the rate of reforms – which are also necessary for Turkey itself – to be maintained and even increased. I also welcome the recent commitment Turkey has shown with regard to Nabucco, which is very important for energy diversification in Europe. However, I must admit that I was somewhat surprised by the gesture that the Turkish Government made last autumn in support of the Iranian authorities. Indeed, I believe that a candidate country’s foreign policy should be in line with that of the Union. Finally, last week, I read an interview with the Turkish Minister for European Affairs which seemed to suggest that Turkey had abolished visas for countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Libya. I was somewhat surprised by this because a candidate country should also be bringing its visa policy closer to that of the European Union, not moving in the opposite direction. I would like confirmation of that information. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has strengthened the European Union’s commitment to stability and development in Afghanistan through the action plan. I would, of course, like to know more about funding for this plan as far as Afghanistan is concerned. Another very important moment for Afghanistan will be the London Conference in January. At that conference, we will hear about the specific pledges made by the European Union and its Member States. We should also hear from the new Afghan Government about the many commitments it must make in areas such as combating corruption and drug trafficking. I am rather alarmed at reports in today’s press of the speech given yesterday by President Karzai on the corruption issue. Ladies and gentlemen, President Obama’s decision to increase his military contingent by 30 000 troops is very recent. In short, Afghanistan is at a crucial stage and the United States and Europe must work in a very coordinated manner. What is at stake in Afghanistan is not only the prosperity and freedom of Afghans, but also the stability of the region, including such an important country as Pakistan. Our own security is also at stake, given the continuing threat posed by al-Qaeda, as has already been said. The credibility of NATO and of what we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan. We cannot fail. In order to succeed, though, as has also been said, we need the support of our own citizens. This support is conditional on transparency and clarity. We must explain that our compatriots in Afghanistan are in serious danger, but we must also stress the importance of the mission there and that failure cannot be an option. As I have said, many important factors are at stake. Francisco José Millán Mon and José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 With regard to the resolution on the Commission’s enlargement strategy paper for 2009, we would like to make it clear, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), that the fact that we supported it overall does not in any way mean that we agree with the recognition of Kosovo as an independent State. We feel that Kosovo is an exceptional case, and we would like to point out that it has not been recognised by Spain or by four other Member States. Consequently, both in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and today in plenary, we have supported the amendments that were in line with our viewpoint. Our vote in favour of the resolution is due to the fact that we do not want our position on Kosovo to be understood as a negative attitude to the enlargement process that the countries of the Western Balkans, Turkey and Iceland are now involved in. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).  
– (ES)
 Madam President, the enlargement process has been a resounding success. The latest enlargement has allowed us to come together with those countries of Central and Eastern Europe that were unfairly denied freedom and prosperity after the Second World War. At present, enlargement is focusing on the western Balkans, Turkey and Iceland. I endorse the ideas that we have identified as the guiding principles of the enlargement process in recent years. I mean consolidation, conditionality and communication. That is to say, that we should fulfil our obligations, but not make rash promises on future enlargements. Secondly, progress in the various accession processes is subject to strict compliance with the conditions. The candidate countries must make a determined effort to carry out the necessary reforms. Thirdly, we must all make an effort to communicate with the citizens. The resolution we are to vote on tomorrow highlights the very important issue of communication. In this connection, I should like to reiterate the broader proposal I made on previous occasions, namely that it would be appropriate also to enhance young Europeans’ knowledge of the Union by making this a compulsory subject in the upper secondary school curriculum. Another relevant idea contained in the resolution is the capacity for integration. Enlargement requires existing Members of the Union to take certain measures. Regarding finance, for instance, enlargement calls for sufficient financial resources to ensure that essential community policies such as the common agricultural policy or cohesion policy are not put at risk. I am about to conclude. I should like to point out that as we are all aware, Kosovo is a special case. Unfortunately, however, there are sections of the resolution where this particularity is not made clear. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, with regard to the Fajon report, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to point out that, although we voted for the report, we do not agree with recital 2a, added by Amendment 4, which states that the Commission ‘should start a visa dialogue with Kosovo with a view to establishing a roadmap for visa facilitation and liberalisation similar to those established with Western Balkan countries’. In my delegation’s view, Kosovo cannot be put on the same footing as the Western Balkan countries. I would point out that Kosovo has not been recognised by the Spanish authorities or by any other Member States. Since the amendment I have mentioned was voted on in block voting with many other amendments, we were not able to vote against it, but we would like it placed on the record that we are not in agreement with its content.

Madam President, relations with Russia are very important: it is a permanent member of the Security Council and a military power; its cooperation is necessary in order to tackle the nuclear challenge of Iran, the issue of the Middle East, disarmament, climate change, etc. Moreover, Russia is a neighbouring country of Europe with which many EU Member States have significant economic relationships and high levels of energy dependence. It is a country with which we have two regular annual summits (which certainly provide a good opportunity at which to evaluate the state of the relationship). Now we are negotiating a new partnership agreement, which would increase cooperation in the so-called four ‘common spaces’. In my view, the most important of these spaces is the economic and energy space: we need openness, clear rules, guarantees for investments, and Russia first of all needs to join the WTO. Next week’s summit should therefore be an opportunity to clarify Russia’s intentions with regard to the WTO and to ensure it does not take initiatives that are incompatible with it. In addition, the gas supply crisis of recent years should not be allowed to recur and the new agreement must include the principles of the European Energy Charter which, as has already been said, is the treaty from which Moscow has unfortunately withdrawn. We must continue to work on the other three spaces as well. I have already mentioned the importance of Russia as a global player. Ladies and gentlemen, we can do many things together with Russia, but, as has also been said, there is one aspect of the relationship that we should not forget, since Russia is a European country and a neighbour. That is the need for it to respect human rights and the obligations that its membership of the Council of Europe imposes upon it in that regard. One of the most obvious failures of the EU’s external affairs policy is the lack of a common policy with regard to Russia. With the instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon, it will be simpler to create this common policy, but it is also necessary for us, as Member States, to have a genuine will to create such a united policy and not to continue prioritising bilateral channels with Moscow, which are, at times, openly divergent from each other. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, the relationship with the United States is, strategically speaking, the European Union’s most important relationship. The United States holds a key position in the world and the European Union is increasingly becoming a global actor. We can, and should, undertake many things together. First of all, we should take a leading role in creating a new, global world, featuring new challenges and the emergence of new actors. We need to further strengthen our relationship and create new institutional mechanisms. This is the right time to undertake such action. We have a government in Washington which favours multilateralism, a European Union strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon and we are witnessing the emergence of a new world which we want to shape together. The resolution we will adopt tomorrow specifically supports the strengthening of the institutional mechanisms, something which Parliament called for in its resolution of 26 March. The decision to create the Transatlantic Economic Council two years ago was the right one. However, in today’s world, we also need to develop excellent coordination in terms of policies and security. We need regular meetings between officials responsible for external affairs and security. That is why this House, this Parliament, supported the creation of a Transatlantic Political Council which, in the future, must include the energy council that you wish to establish at the next summit. The Parliament also wants two summits to take place every year. If we have two summits with Russia, why not with the United States? Ladies and gentlemen, there is increasing talk of a G2 being set up by the United States and China, that is to say, a privileged relationship between the top global players. It worries me that we Europeans may weaken our role as partners and undermine our privileged relationship with the United States. We must explain to the United States that, in the field of foreign policy, the Union will be strengthened by the Treaty. The European Union, or the Europe of today, is no longer the problem it had been for decades. Today, in this complex world, Europe should be part of the solution, and I hope that is the way the United States sees the situation. In order for this to occur, as the Commissioner pointed out, Europeans also need to act in line with the global role we want to have, and to be up to the mark, with respect to the privileged relationship to which we aspire with the United States. To summarise, a key issue for the upcoming summit, in my opinion, should be the strengthening of transatlantic relations, including at institutional level. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, given the EU’s dependence on external energy supplies, securing its supply is an issue which must always form part of the EU’s external policy. In addition, all predictions agree that energy demand in the world will increase significantly over the next 25 years. Here in Europe, we have to reduce our high dependence on Russian gas, particularly following the crises in recent years. There is also a clear strategy in Russia to secure its dominance in Europe over the gas sector. That is why we have projects such as Nord Stream, Blue Stream II and also South Stream. We therefore need to diversify in terms of suppliers and routes. That is the reason for the interest in Nabucco, which will give access to Azerbaijani and Iraqi gas, and also to gas from Turkmenistan, thus reinforcing our energy relations with Central Asia, which is an increasingly important region. I am therefore delighted about the agreement reached last July, as reported by the Commissioner, and also the explicit support given to Nabucco by President Barroso in the political guidelines that he recently presented. I know that there are doubts about the viability of Nabucco, but I also had doubts about the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, which is now a reality. I must stress that the countries around the southern rim of the Mediterranean also have an important role to play in the supply of gas to Europe. The main country in this respect is Algeria, which is an important supplier of gas to my country and to Italy. We must ensure that the work on the Medgaz pipeline is quickly completed. I also want to highlight countries such as Egypt and Libya in terms of gas supplies. To sum up, energy issues must be a priority in the Euro-Mediterranean relationship, to the benefit of both sides. Ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon includes energy as a shared responsibility and lays down that one of the EU’s energy policy objectives will be to guarantee the security of energy supplies. This really encourages us to move forward with developing an increasingly essential common foreign policy on energy, as stressed by the motion for a resolution to be adopted today. I will end by saying that this is a difficult objective, as proven by our failure in Europe, in the European Union, to achieve a true internal market in energy, because we do not even have the necessary interconnections. That is why I am delighted about the commitments made in this respect in the document mentioned by President Barroso. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I am here to talk about Iran, and I would first like to join in expressing my condolences for the victims of this morning’s plane crash. Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with many of the ideas that have already been expressed regarding the situation in Iran following the electoral process. This process was neither free nor fair, and has allowed President Ahmadinejad and the most radical sectors of the regime to remain in power, violently repressing demonstrators, preventing journalists from doing their job and seeking to hold a supposed external conspiracy responsible for internal disorder, while using misinformation to conceal the truth. What is certain is that the Iranian regime has been seriously damaged, both internally and in terms of its external image. Moreover, the oligarchy that has enjoyed power in recent decades is now divided, which will affect the stability of the regime. At the same time, discontent among the people will continue to grow, especially if oil prices do not rise again and consequently the economic situation does not improve. The European Union needs to maintain a united front and continue to condemn the abuses committed in Iran. It should demand greater respect for human rights, and we also need to look at how we can help civil society, in particular those sectors that want democratic pluralism and respect for human rights for their country. We should not disappoint those sectors that are looking to the West, including the European Union. However, with regard to Iran we must also not forget the threat that its nuclear programme represents, as it is having a destabilising effect on the region and on non-proliferation in general. It is essential that the European Union and the United States continue to cooperate on this matter, and I am sure that this will be a priority for the Swedish Presidency. We need to fully involve Russia and China, which are permanent members of the Security Council. Their support is essential in order for a negotiated solution to be found to this grave threat, which requires unity and firmness from the international community. I therefore welcome the resolution adopted in this respect last week at the G8. Ladies and gentlemen, the events of the last few weeks have openly demonstrated the extremism and radical nature of the current Iranian leaders; it is clear that the international community cannot afford for them to obtain nuclear weapons.

Mr President, Commissioner, these are tough times for the European fisheries sector. The serious economic crisis that is devastating Europe, the scarcity of marine resources needed to allow the fleets to be economically viable and the negotiations on agreements that are often unacceptable because of their detrimental interests, mean that the sector is looking towards the future with some concern. If we add to that the shameful obstruction of the multiannual plans by the Council, which is also seeking pretexts for reneging on the Treaty itself – something that we absolutely will not stand for – we end up with a panorama that is pretty bleak. We are discussing different aspects of great importance, including the external dimension of the common fisheries policy, which enables the EU fleet to fish in the high seas and in third-country waters, and through which the European Union also exports principles of good governance, leading the fight for sustainability, ensuring food security in the least-developed countries and eradicating illegal fishing. In all, 60 % of the fish consumed in the European Union comes from third-country imports and, as a consequence, one of the objectives of the external dimension of this policy must be to ensure the continuity of the economically viable high-sea fishing. We do not agree that the fisheries agreements should entail an exclusivity clause that prevents the European fleet from fishing in third-country waters when the European Union has failed to conclude a new protocol and we have several examples of that. Nor do we agree that there should be penalties for the temporary reflagging of EU vessels when they change their flag so that they can access third-country waters – even if those countries comply with all of the international regulations – where no agreement on access to resources has been reached. Similarly, we do not agree with the fact that the fishing authorisation fees that shipowners have to pay to access the fishery resources of a third country can triple on occasion without a cost-benefit analysis having been carried out. In my opinion, it is pointless to propose keeping fish stocks above, rather than at, maximum sustainable yield, as this would reduce fishing opportunities by more than is necessary. For these and other reasons, our group has tabled an alternative motion for a resolution, which, in our opinion, improves the rapporteur’s proposal. In conclusion, Commissioner – and I see that the Council is absent once again – fisheries is such an important sector that it is crucial for the three institutions to be able to reach agreement and work towards the same goal. Parliament certainly will. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

I am a firm advocate of programmes aimed at education and young people and specifically of the Erasmus programme, and I am concerned by the news regarding its immediate future. However, as a Member from an outermost region such as the Canary Islands, I am also concerned that our young people do not enjoy equal opportunities in the mobility measures financed by the EU. Young people from the Canary Islands cannot and should not be in a worse situation than other young people in the EU due to living in an outermost region. Youth unemployment figures in the outermost regions are really worrying and it is our duty to ensure that the additional cost of students travelling from their outermost region of origin is borne by the programme itself and not by the students, who often see this additional cost as an insurmountable obstacle that prevents them from accessing Erasmus grants. Yes there should be Erasmus for all, but that should include young people from the outermost regions. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, I am not going to talk about independence for Catalonia, I am going to talk about La Gomera, a small island which is part of the Canary Islands and which has experienced an appalling fire, a fire which began on 4 August and was not extinguished officially until last month, in September. Not only has the fire affected the Garajonay National Park, which has been a World Heritage site since 1986, it has also scorched around 11 % of the surface area of the island, and more than 4 000 people have had to be evacuated. The damage caused to the environment, to the economy and to the living conditions of the islanders has been estimated at around EUR 60 million and is very difficult to rectify. So, what I would like to talk about today is solidarity, the solidarity of Europe with a very small but very important part of the Europe which unites us, about Europe’s solidarity with La Gomera and its inhabitants. The Spanish Government has already requested the intervention of the Solidarity Fund. All that remains now is for it to become effective and for us to help La Gomera to move forward. We are talking about the future of the island and that future is something for which we are all responsible. Gabriel Mato Adrover,

Mr President, Commissioner, based on the fact that in my view the agreements with Peru, Colombia and Central America are tremendously damaging for European banana producers, and the Canary Islands in particular, and that the only safety margin we have left is economic compensation via the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), which I hope is obtained, I have to express my satisfaction, given that these reports have included many of our proposals, which I am grateful for. The negotiated safeguard clauses have been improved and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas has been strengthened. There will be greater transparency and exhaustive monitoring of banana imports into the European Union with prior surveillance measures. Moreover, and what I believe is an essential point, the Commission shall present an annual report on how the clause is functioning, which should include an examination of the development of banana imports and their impact on European production. These are all very positive elements. European banana producers, all of which also come from the outermost regions, need help during these difficult times. There still some way to go, but this is a very significant step. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, if I may, I shall use my speech in this joint debate on fisheries policy in order to make some demands. Today, we are debating good reports that properly define Parliament’s efforts to achieve sustainable fishing by preserving fish stocks, and which try to establish a common organisation of the markets in which consumers are not only protected but also well informed. In addition, we are stressing the need to take action against those who authorise unsustainable fishing, and we are doing so by discussing, debating and reaching agreements. Unfortunately, however, those efforts clash with the actions of those who sometimes confuse confidentiality with a lack of transparency, with protocol negotiations carried out behind Parliament’s back and, what is worse, behind the backs of those who should be benefiting from the very same agreement. Commissioner Damanaki, there is still time to rectify this situation. Please do so. Our efforts also clash with those who are less concerned about blocking instruments that are fundamental to developing the sector as they are about not losing powers which even the Treaty does not bestow on them. Mr Mavroyiannis, we still have time. Stop blocking the management plans. It is important for the fishing industry and therefore for the citizens of Europe and for us. Therefore, at a time of uncertainty with so many boats and so few fishing opportunities, with fierce competition from imported products and a considerable reduction in subsidies, we have an obligation to support this reform. We should do so bearing in mind the fishermen in Galicia, Andalusia, the Canary Islands and all the other regions of Europe. They expect something very simple from us: that we do not let them down.

Mr President, Commissioner, I want to clearly express, with the resolution and conviction given to us by the force of reason, the Committee on Fisheries’ unanimous concern when it comes to possible agreements under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) on state responsibility for vessels’ activities. Ladies and gentlemen, in the fishing regulations of both the European Union and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), there is an overall principle that is paradigm in the regulation to control fishing activities and the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing: it establishes that the flag state is primarily responsible for controlling its vessels’ activities, wherever they work. Based on this principle, the flag state must, for example, certify that their vessels’ catches conform to legislation. This catch certification is essential to these catches being unloaded in EU ports and being sent to market. However, it is also essential to respect the adopted conservation and fishing management measures, the objective of which is to ultimately bring fish stocks up to sustainable levels for fishing. Many states without their own fleet must charter ships from other countries to fish, which is natural, as long as they comply with the legal requirements. That said, Commissioner, you are aware, as we all are, that many of these chartering states have neither the resources, the capacity, nor often the will to control the fishing activities of these vessels. You will agree that, if there is no guarantee of an effective control of fishing activities, it is absolutely impossible to fight against illegal fishing and it is very difficult to aid sustainability, which is the cornerstone of our common fisheries policy (CFP) and the focus of its reform, which we are currently debating in Parliament. In the latest CITES meeting, the Working Group on Introduction from the Sea discussed the flag state’s responsibility over the species covered by CITES, and proposed to transfer this responsibility to the chartering state for CITES species caught on the high seas. This working group will report to the Standing Committee of the Convention in July 2012 and this committee, in turn, will report to the Conference of the Parties (COP) at the March 2013 meeting, when a definitive decision will be taken. According to my information on the European Union, the Commission held a meeting with the Member States last Monday. During this meeting, the Commission appears to have inexplicably announced that there is no official position, that is, that the Member States are free to adopt whichever position they consider to be most convenient for their interests in the upcoming COP. If this is the case, Commissioner, you can understand that it is both disappointing and discouraging that the Commission has not taken a stand on such a vital issue, particularly during a period when we are reforming the CFP. I have been informed that in the coming days, there will be a meeting between Member States and the Commission itself to adopt a common position. I think that there is still time to rectify the situation and for the Commission to send out a clear and resounding message, preventing the derogation of what has been the basic principle up until now: the flag state’s responsibility. This issue is a lot more important than some irresponsibly believe. If the proposal goes ahead, it will set a precedent that will undoubtedly cause great harm to our fisheries management and to the fight against illegal fishing. The Commission cannot allow all the work undertaken hitherto to be thrown away. It has been a joint effort on two aspects in which Parliament is completely involved and which also involves regional organisations such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) or the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) itself. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will finish. Under no circumstances, in my opinion, should the charter state be granted responsibility for controlling their vessels’ activity; this must remain the flag state’s responsibility. This is the unequivocal position of the Committee on Fisheries of this Parliament, and I hope it is also that of the Commission itself. For that reason, I ask if the Commission could explain its position on the issue and how it will ensure that the primary responsibility of the flag state is maintained. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, we are debating herring, we are debating multiannual plans, but essentially, we are debating jurisdiction, the competencies of Parliament and the need for the Council to accept and most importantly respect what was established in the Treaty of Lisbon, and furthermore, to respect the decision of the legal services themselves. This is codecision and in this context, a political decision by the Council that not only calls into question the competencies of Parliament, something which we cannot or should not allow of course, but most importantly, puts the future of such essential issues as the reform of the common fisheries policy at risk. I am addressing the absent Council members and also the Commissioner today; I think the issue is much more important than some believe. Give some thought to the matter. Gabriel Mato Adrover,

Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, please believe me when I say that, with this being my first speech before this House as chair of the Committee on Fisheries, I would rather not have had to make it, because we are not only going to talk about fishing, total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas – although these are very important – but also issues of jurisdiction. The question I asked on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries relates to the Treaty of Lisbon and how it should be applied in the area of fisheries policies, and, as I said previously, this goes much further than an isolated discrepancy. It concerns the undertaking by the three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – to accept the rules of the game that we agreed upon, based on the premise which underlies the Treaty: to take appropriate decisions, each according to its responsibilities, in the interests of the citizens of Europe. There is no doubt that the new Treaty has made major changes to the decision-making process for fisheries policy, and understandably it is going to take time to make the necessary adjustments to ensure that the new procedures operate correctly and in full. However, unfortunately we have learned from experience in the two years since the Treaty came into force that the Council and, in some cases, the Commission continue to deliberately – or so I believe – put up obstacles in an attempt to prevent Parliament from exercising its new prerogatives. This is unacceptable. Parliament cannot accept under any circumstances that the Council should continue to operate as if nothing had changed, as if Parliament were a mere bystander and the Treaty of Lisbon and the new division of competences had never existed. Minister, Commissioner, whether you like it or not, Parliament cannot be excluded from making decisions on fisheries policy, whether internal or external. These are not my words, they are the Treaty’s. Now, once again, following the Commission’s proposal, the Council has sought to exceed the scope of Article 43(3) of the Treaty, quite unacceptably in our view, in an attempt to exclude Parliament’s voice from the decision-making process. The procedure laid down in this article clearly refers to the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, that is, decisions on TACs and quotas, and to these two aspects alone – not to a whole series of other measures for achieving the objectives of the common fisheries policy, which would be covered by Article 43(2). As is stated in the preamble to the question, technical measures, such as prohibition or restricted zones and periods, restricted fishing depths and specific requirements related to fishing gear can in no way be interpreted as falling under the remit of Article 43(3). Parliament’s position is quite clear. We have been stating it for some time now: you cannot take a broad interpretation which is in clear contradiction with any exceptional status. Our reaction, in various dossiers, has always been to seek proportionate measures. We clashed over the Venezuela–French Guiana dossier, when the Council decided to forge ahead without Parliament’s consent. We had no alternative than to go to the European Court of Justice. Also when we opposed the Council’s blocking of long-term plans for hake and anchovy; we disagreed and we chose the first reading to try to negotiate seriously with the Council for a second reading. In terms of TAC and quota regulations we have been even more tolerant, if that is possible. It has not escaped our attention that what was adopted in 2010 and 2011 – in both cases on the basis of Article 43(3) – was done incorrectly. We continued to insist that sufficient time should elapse before the Council and the Commission could take joint decisions and were operating correctly. However, now of course we realise that in this case they are introducing a recital on certain conditions, functionally linked to the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, when clearly the concept of associated conditions, formerly covered in Article 20 of the Regulation, has been explicitly omitted from the new Treaty. The Members of the European Parliament thought that we should allow some time to elapse. However, we are – and I say this clearly – most disappointed because in 2012, three years after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, there are still major discrepancies between what the Commission proposes and what the Council approve, on the one hand, and what the Regulation states on the other. In my view, neither institution has given any indication that it is willing to abandon this broad interpretation of Article 43(3) for once and for all, and adopt another procedure that is more respectful of Parliament’s prerogatives. To conclude, there is unanimity among groups, coordinators and all the Members. We have made our approach very clear in our oral questions and I would like the Commission and the Council to answer the questions we have put to them today just as clearly. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
).

 Mr President, the feelings of hundreds of thousands of farmers in many regions in Spain can be summed up in a simple but resounding word: ‘no’. We say ‘no’ to an unbalanced agreement; ‘no’ to an agreement without even a single guarantee that customs duties will be paid or fraud prevented; ‘no’ to an agreement that allows unfair competition against our farmers, inducing them to abandon their crops. In short, we say ‘no’ to the disappearance of fruit and vegetable farmers in regions such as Andalusia, Murcia and the Canary Islands. Our ‘no’ should not come as any surprise. It is a consistent ‘no’, just like our consistent ‘yes’ to the fishing agreement. We have not changed tack. We are defending today what we defended last July in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. We voted against then, and we will vote against once more on Thursday, because nothing has changed. However, we do not want anyone to see this as a ‘no’ against the Kingdom of Morocco, which is a preferential partner, and should continue to be one in the future. While Morocco may benefit from the European Commission’s inability to amend the regulation on entry prices, it is not responsible for it. I will finish by saying that our ‘no’ today is also a ‘yes’. It is a clear ‘yes’ to our farmers; a ‘yes’ to reciprocity and strict respect for agreements; a ‘yes’ to good relations between the European Union and third countries; a ‘yes’ to being able to continue farming; and lastly a ‘yes’ to differences being defined by quality, not by fraud. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is clear that something is wrong when we are debating an extension today, in the month of December, which ends in scarcely two months. Nonetheless, we are discussing an agreement that is important to the European Union and to Spain in particular, an agreement that cannot be used as an excuse for diverse claims that are not strictly fishing based, and one which I agree should be extended despite the fact that many aspects of the agreement are unsatisfactory. I have always defended agreements with third countries, and even more so with neighbouring countries and those of such importance as the Kingdom of Morocco. It is precisely for that reason that I hope that the extension will be ratified and that a new agreement is negotiated, which is balanced, fair and beneficial for all signatories and allows our fleet to continue working. I am confident that this agreement will be reached, and that, as well as being economically viable and guaranteeing the sustainability and conservation of resources, it will also have positive consequences for the signatories from a social and working perspective. However, I also robustly defend that the agreements must be respected and comprehensively fulfilled, and for that reason and to be consistent, I questioned the agreement with Morocco for the agricultural sector and I emphatically support the agreement for the fishing sector. We do not have anything against Morocco, quite the opposite, but this does not detract from the fact that we demand that the agreements are respected as is deserved by the citizens we represent. This Parliament should send a clear and open message to the Commission that they should negotiate and negotiate well, without delay and with transparency. Remember that poor negotiations always bring poor consequences. There are many examples. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, much has been said over recent days about the volcano on the island of El Hierro, in the Canary Islands. I was there last Friday and experienced for myself, along with the people of El Hierro, an earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale. I can assure you that it was not a pleasant situation to be in. However, it was even more unpleasant to see the situation in which the thousands of inhabitants of this small and very European island find themselves, with their lives determined by the volcano and continuous seismic activity. The tunnel linking the two main cities on the island is closed, people cannot go out to fish, and businesses are being closed down. People are seeing a major crisis grow to terrible proportions, and they can do nothing but wait. This wait is unsustainable from an economic perspective. Fishermen, farmers, small business owners, hoteliers and society as a whole all urgently need Europe’s assistance and economic support in order to tackle not only the present situation, but also an uncertain future. The European Union must be where it is needed. That place today, more than ever, is the island of El Hierro. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, it is precisely in situations of crisis that the efficiency of and confidence in institutions is seen. In this case, they have left much to be desired. The Commission has said precisely that suspicions about Spanish cucumbers have not been confirmed. No, Commissioner: what has been confirmed is that the suspicions were unfounded, irresponsible and without objective data; what has been confirmed is that there are 23 dead and that the Spanish horticultural sector has suffered enormous damage. What has also been confirmed is that the Commission must do what it has not done up to now, which is to act with conviction on various fronts: stop the outbreak; prevent unfounded suspicions from being given a glimmer of credibility, seriously affecting a Member State – in this case, Spain – by taking the necessary measures to achieve this; compensate the damage suffered without delay and restore to the Spanish brand its image of safe, very high quality agricultural products. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, the best thing about asking a question is that you get an answer, even if, in this case, it could be considered disappointing in some ways. The fisheries sector is clearly in crisis: fishers’ incomes are lower every day, making it difficult to continue working in this field in many cases. We are not talking about stealth subsidies or unsustainable practices: we are talking about problems that require our full support. We suggest it time and again, and reiterating a fair demand, as Mr Cadec has done, cannot be reproached: he is being consistent. Nobody has suggested increasing fishing efforts. We do not understand why measures that are immediately relevant to exceptional situations have to be rejected. We are just suggesting that the Commission not turn its back on a sector that urgently needs aid, and this aid can, today, be an increase in de minimis
 aid. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
).

 Mr President, the tomato growers of the Canary Islands, Murcia, Andalusia and the Community of Valencia, all of them European Union producers, need the Commission to take robust action with regard to an unfair situation which is causing them serious damage. Fraud is being committed, and you know it. Thanks to its agreement with the EU, Morocco benefits from an entry price to which it does not adhere. In addition, we should not only look at 2007, but also at 2010. The Commission is well aware that Spanish tomato growers have to compete with Moroccan growers under unfair conditions, as they must bear much higher production costs stemming from the strict European standards on quality, food safety and workplace safety, as well as restrictions on pesticides which are not required of third countries. Even so, our growers, with great effort and commitment to quality, continue to work hard to save their crops. Thus, it is unacceptable for the Commission to ignore the malfunctioning of the entry price regime, whose complexity encourages fraud, as the European Anti-Fraud Office itself does, and for the Commission to look the other way when the tomato quotas agreed with Morocco are being contravened. It is not enough for the Commission to tell us that surveillance is the responsibility of the Member States. If they fail in their duties, the Commission must act. It is intolerable for regulations on Moroccan import quotas to be breached, and for the applicable customs duties to go unpaid, without the Commission taking any action. The Commission would have us approve a new agreement with Morocco. Unless we are given assurances that the price system will be modified to prevent unfair competition between Moroccan and Spanish produce, we will certainly not be supporting that initiative. It is your obligation to ensure adherence to agreements, but it is also your obligation to defend the interests of growers in the Canary Islands, Murcia, Valencia, and Andalusia. Do it before it is too late. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Madam President, I would respectfully inform Mr Campbell Bannerman that his banana is not from the Canary Islands. Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to talk about bananas in this plenary sitting and I think that it is positive that bananas are being talked about here. It is positive because it is important to reiterate the need for EU banana producers to be protected, including those in the Canaries. I think this because I believe that the conclusion of the Geneva Agreement on Trade in Bananas is not good news for EU producers. Moreover, there are aspects of the resolution that we are debating today that are not completely satisfactory from the point of view of agriculture and of protecting EU banana producers. However, I am aware that this proposal originates with the Committee on International Trade, whose criteria relating to several issues are very different from those that I am able to have. I will therefore assess the positive aspects of the proposal and not the negative ones. It is positive that it brings to a close so many years of disputes in the World Trade Organisation, thus restoring tranquillity to a sector that needs certainty and stability for the future above all else. EU producers belong to the outermost regions, which have enormous problems producing bananas – or excellent-quality ones, anyway – and whose banana production is nothing like that in third countries in any respect, including in terms of cost, workforce, the environment or of plant protection safeguards. From an agricultural point of view, it is important to stress that the agreement is damaging to EU producers. We are facing drastic cuts in tariffs, from EUR 176 to EUR 114 per tonne and EUR 75 per tonne in the case of the agreements with Colombia and Peru. Therefore, Commissioner, with all due respect, I can tell you that it is not credible that there were provisions for this drop in tariffs in the financial detail of the 2006 Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), because it is not true. The Commissioner said that it was provided for in relation to the Geneva Agreement; let us bear in mind that this tariff is EUR 114. There could never have been provision in 2006 for the tariff to decrease to EUR 75 as there is following these agreements. I therefore believe that the necessary evaluations should be carried out and it will be confirmed that it is absolutely necessary for the financial details of the agreement to be updated because, inter alia
, the Commission already saw the tariff of EUR 176 per tonne itself as low when it was implemented. EU producers are not, therefore, asking for anything that is not wholly justified, and we in Parliament have an obligation to protect them, as does the Commission. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, in my speech, I am going to focus on two reports whose procedure and final results are an example of what to do and what not to do. I am referring to the plan for anchovy stocks and the use of exotic species in aquaculture. Regarding anchovies, an example of how not to do things, the subject has been under discussion for more than one year and, unfortunately, it has become a debate on the powers that the Treaty of Lisbon grants to Parliament and on the legal basis for the Commission proposal, rather than a debate on what is better for fishermen, industries and fisheries. It has been a long and futile debate, the victim of which has been the sector, which has looked on in astonishment as we have become lost in discussions while the long-awaited management plan has yet to move forward and is in danger of never seeing the light of day. People who work in the anchovy sector are rightly complaining about the administrative hindrances that this plan is facing, when it is so essential for avoiding further interruptions to the activities of this fishery. I sincerely believe that, given this background of uncertainty, the Commission should seek to send a positive signal to the sector today in Parliament. On the contrary, with regard to the use of exotic species, the agreement reached by Parliament at first reading is a good compromise. The Commission, the Council and Parliament have succeeded in reaching an agreement quickly and without major disagreements over law or fact. The agreement not only establishes a strict definition of closed aquaculture facilities, but also achieves greater legal clarity for the businesses in the sector and, more importantly, removes a piece of the bureaucracy that Europeans have had enough of. I am convinced that the administrative processes need to be reduced to an essential minimum. Europeans have to deal with excessive bureaucracy, which makes it extremely difficult to start up or operate any activity. Therefore, reports such as today’s that remove administrative procedures are not only good news for the aquaculture sector but should also be a constant feature of the way in which we work. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Madam President, I am also going to talk about Venezuela, because there are some people who do not understand that democracy is not just about casting votes. Democracy is being able to do so with security, freedom and equality, and in a democracy and under a system of freedoms, private property must also be respected. Unfortunately, at present in Venezuela, the public and their businesses are under threat. In this respect, I would like to mention one business, Agroisleña, which was founded by people from the Canary Islands and on which more than 1 000 families depend. It has been unfairly expropriated, and like so many other businesses, after many years of hard work, it is failing, following capricious decisions by those who think that anything goes. First, land was confiscated, now businesses are being confiscated, so who knows what will be next? It is time for the people of Venezuela to feel free and for businesspeople to no longer feel defenceless and permanently under threat. As has already been said, it is time for Venezuela to be a genuine democracy where there is no doubt that terrorists will not find refuge. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, if we are talking about territorial cohesion, we have to talk about islands, mountain regions and also the outermost regions. It means talking about their problems and difficulties, their natural disadvantages and their structural handicaps. However, it also fundamentally means talking about how we can remove the obstacles that prevent their development. It means talking about strategies for converting those disadvantages into opportunities. Improving connectivity, an adequate neighbourhood policy and stability in policies and in the Structural Funds are issues that we need to tackle without hesitation, on the basis of two major premises: territorial cohesion and the principle of solidarity. There are people who do not believe in strategies. I do believe in them, and this resolution should be proof of Parliament’s commitment to these regions and of its demand for the Commission to make political decisions that take into account the needs of these vulnerable areas, whose problems become even more harshly evident in times of economic crisis such as we are experiencing at the moment.

Madam President, it is two years and one month today since the air accident that claimed 154 victims at Barajas Airport, Madrid, and tore apart many families, most of which were in the Canary Islands. All Members share their pain. Unfortunately, today, two years later, the technical investigation has not been concluded. The victims’ families are still wondering what happened and they have no answers. I find this state of affairs regrettable for two fundamental reasons: firstly, because the victims’ families do not deserve it, and secondly, because important information that would be fundamental for air safety and could be essential to preventing further incidents is not coming to light. I trust that this regulation that we will adopt tomorrow will at least, among other things, help to speed up the technical investigation processes and to ensure that these situations are not repeated. I share the concerns expressed by my colleague, Mr de Grandes, and I congratulate the rapporteur on achieving an agreement at first reading, but I hope that we have not given in on too many things in order to satisfy certain interests: it is the victims that are important here and they come first.

Mr President, once again, we are going to talk about free trade agreements between the European Union and third countries. I have already spoken about the agreements with Colombia and Peru, which are extremely damaging to the banana industry in the Canary Islands, and today, I wish to talk about Morocco. On 16 September, the Commission adopted its proposal on a new agricultural chapter of the association agreement with Morocco: a proposal that increases the tomato quotas, maintains the October to May period instead of extending it to the whole year, and does not revise the entry price system which has been proven to be fraudulent, as recognised by The European Anti-Fraud Office itself. This agreement is lethal for EU producers, essentially in Andalusia, Murcia, Valencia and the Canary Islands, and the Commission is perfectly aware of that. The Commission cannot look the other way and propose a fresh agreement with no guarantees when the current agreement is being violated without any measures being taken. There needs to be an urgent review of the entry price system and I ask the Commission to undertake one without further delay. The Commission has an obligation to defend farmers, so defend them!

 Madam President, this is not the first time that I have spoken about Venezuela and the breaches of human rights that are occurring in that beautiful country and I fear it will not be the last. During my previous speech I referred to journalists. Today I am referring to judges such as Judge Afiuni, and as always to ordinary Venezuelans, who, like the thousands of canaries that live there, only want to live in peace and freedom. These people aspire to safeguard their land and their affairs without the permanent uncertainty of ‘what will happen tomorrow’. Venezuela has been a land of refuge for many. Today, unfortunately, it is a country where freedom of expression and other freedoms and rights are mere memories. We are talking here today about human rights and who is breaching them. May our support go out from here to Judge Afiuni, and to everyone living in Venezuela, together with our hope that political freedoms will once more be a reality. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with a reform that is simple but extremely important for the outermost regions. This is especially the case at a time when the crisis is affecting everyone, but is affecting these regions in a fundamental way, as they have permanent structural handicaps that mean that they need these changes. I am going to talk about the Canary Islands. In the case of the Canary Islands, the most important change is regarding supplies of milk-based preparations intended for industrial processing. We are talking about skimmed milk powder with vegetable fat, which is a traditional product for local consumers that has been sold in the Canary Islands for more than 40 years. After a great deal of effort and despite many difficulties, a local industry was established that generates employment and obvious added value. I would like to highlight this because, in the current times, particularly on our islands, which have extremely high unemployment, supporting a small industry that creates jobs is not only a necessity but an obligation. The proposal is to maintain the supply of this product, which is used for local consumption in small quantities of 800 tonnes per year. This would eliminate the transitional nature of the measure, which is of little importance in the global context, and therefore give stability to this industry. As I said before, the outermost regions have significant handicaps, but they must be considered an opportunity for Europe. The different association agreements that are being worked on and debated at the moment, such as the free trade agreements with Colombia and Peru and others on which negotiations are beginning, such as with Mercosur, are a clear threat to our agricultural sector. I am thinking about numerous products: tomatoes, bananas, and the livestock sector. I have said this many times: these agreements must achieve a balance, whereby everyone surrenders a little ground, so we all win. However, in no way must one product or one specific sector be forced to bear the cost of the agreements. Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Alves, and thank the Commission and the Council who, along with Parliament, have succeeded in reaching an agreement in this first trialogue on agriculture. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Madam President, I am going to talk about tourism, a fundamental sector for the Canary Islands, which receive around 12 million tourists per year. If there is one thing that tourism needs, it is certainty. Situations like the one that we have experienced – and which may be repeated – have dramatic consequences for this strategic sector for the Canary Islands. The losses have not only been suffered by the airlines, the airports and the tour operators: hotels, car hire companies, restaurants and services in general have suffered huge damage. Between 15 and 23 April alone, 313 818 aeroplane seats were cancelled in the Canary Islands, with losses of around EUR 57.3 million as a result of the tourists not coming. This is, of course, a significant loss. We need immediate measures when the event occurs, such as opening airports at night without additional costs and looking after the public, the passengers, properly; but we also need compensation. I am not going to criticise what was done or what was not done or say whether the crisis was managed well or not. It is only worth being aware that it could happen again and that we need to be prepared for it. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, last week Europe missed a great opportunity: the opportunity to be the world leader in astrophysical research for the next twenty years. The European Southern Observatory decided, on the basis of reports which were far from transparent, that the European Very Large Telescope would be located in Chile and not in the Canaries. This is a time to congratulate Chile, but also to reflect on whether in Europe everything possible was done to have a European installation, decided on by a European institution, with European funding involving an investment of more than EUR 1 billion, located in Europe rather than in the Americas. The European Parliament was unanimous in its support for locating it in La Palma and I am grateful for that, but what did the Council do? What did the Spanish Presidency do? Did it hold any meetings with the Observatory? Did it hold any meetings with any of those Member States responsible for deciding on the location of the telescope? Did it really support the European bid? Europeans from La Palma, the Canaries and the rest of Europe are waiting for answers on this. At the moment they are left with the conviction that not everything was done that could have been done. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, although it is merely an administrative issue for certain people, for others it is much more. We are talking about freedom. I know that for some people freedom must be defended in certain ways and in certain places. However, I also know that for some people, true freedom, their own freedom, is one that is imposed by certain dictators whom they defend and in some cases they even encourage and not the freedom of people like us who defend this word to its fullest extent, who believe in free media and who believe that land cannot be taken by decree. You should ask the thousands of people from the Canary Islands who have been subjected to this situation in Venezuela. We are talking about rights, plurality and freedom. Unfortunately, certain people do not believe in this yet. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, last December, the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco entered into an agreement to liberalise trade in agricultural products. Unfortunately, the only information we have on the content of this agreement has been gleaned from the media. This information indicates an increase in the quota for tomatoes imported into the European Union, something we categorically reject, as the Kingdom of Morocco has repeatedly failed to honour its obligations to the European Union. The European Commission refuses to admit to the existence of this situation, even though OLAF itself has done so. We cannot allow the Commission to continue turning a blind eye, disregarding the needs of producers in the Canary Islands, Andalusia, Murcia and Alicante. We therefore appeal strongly for agreements to be honoured and for more attention to be paid to plant health controls. In addition, the timetable for Moroccan exports should be made more flexible, allowing exports to be spread across the entire year. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, the situation in the agricultural sector is not only of concern. I would call it unsustainable: farmers’ incomes are declining and every day there is a greater difference between what farmers receive and the market price for consumers. Succession is already a Utopia, and association agreements are repeatedly infringed, as in the shameful case of tomatoes from Morocco, a situation that has been recognised by the European Anti-Fraud Office with no decisive action by the Commission. Plant health rules and controls are applied to varying degrees, creating entirely unfair situations. If we add to this isolated cases, such as the decrease in duty for the banana sector, which is going to have entirely negative consequences, or the fact that it is impossible for livestock farmers to afford input costs, you will agree with me that the future of the sector is, at the very least, uncertain. Moreover, for agriculture in the most remote regions, the future is not only uncertain but extremely worrying. Farmers want to continue farming, but it is becoming more difficult for them every day. The Commission must accept the importance of agriculture. Face up to it boldly! Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, agreements should be honoured and rules should bind everyone equally. This statement, which may seem obvious, is not so obvious in reality when we are talking about the Association Agreement between the European Union and Morocco, which contains consistent irregularities, as recognised by the European Anti-Fraud Office. Spanish tomato producers, particularly in the Canary Islands, are going through a difficult time, and need the agreement to be honoured, but also want to know what the Commission plans to do about the new agreement that is still being negotiated: whether an increase has been offered in the preferential tomato quota and under what terms, whether the entry price system is going to be changed to prevent further breaches in the future, and whether the plant health requirements demanded of European producers are going to be enforced. Also, while we are talking about agreements, banana producers are also following negotiations, in some cases bilateral negotiations with third countries, with a great deal of concern, because such dealings could have irreparable consequences if they do not go hand in hand with compensatory measures. In both cases, the Commission cannot abandon its producers and we cannot allow that to happen. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, a fire is always a tragedy, a tragedy for people, a tragedy for the environment, an economic and social tragedy. I had the misfortune to live very close to this tragedy, to the fire that took place this summer on the island of La Palma in the Canaries. I therefore welcome this resolution and I am convinced that we are going to be able to adopt it unanimously. It is a complete resolution, which has received many contributions and which, above all, does something important. First of all, it remembers the victims, all the victims, and pays tribute to all those who work voluntarily to put the fires out. However, it also includes some significant reflections on the importance of drought and desertification in the spread of the fires, and the resulting disappearance of hundreds of thousands of hectares per year. There are also important reflections on the causes that aggravate the fires, such as the gradual abandonment of the countryside, deficient maintenance of the forests and inadequate punishment for arsonists. In this respect, we need to act and we need to act firmly. The Commission needs to draw up a risk prevention strategy and an effective strategy for combating natural disasters, and a protocol for uniform action. However, aid is also important, for restoration, for re-establishing production potential and for compensating for the social costs and job losses. As the Commissioner said, coordination is vital. However, there needs to be coordination between the different Community instruments: the Structural Funds, the Solidarity Fund – which clearly needs to be reformed – and their flexibility, and also instruments such as Aid Plus and, of course, the rapid response mechanism that we have already discussed. We need to go further in solving these problems, and I sincerely believe that this resolution is the right way to do so. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Mr President, I believe that the thing we politicians must be able to tackle is unforeseen circumstances. I believe the European Council tackled the unforeseen, and I think it did well – and I say this standing alongside my friend Mr Atkins – in not giving in to Mr Cameron’s blackmail. I also believe it did well in seeking an alternative solution, the intergovernmental treaty. Sometimes, God moves in mysterious ways. We have an intergovernmental treaty that will be easier to approve than the reform of Article 48, and which will come into force sooner. The crux of the matter – and I am addressing the President of the European Council, my friend Herman Van Rompuy – is to do it quickly and for Parliament to be involved in the exercise. This seems fundamental because, returning to the metaphor of the lunch used previously by Mr Verhofstadt, I believe that if the European Council makes this lunch without Parliament, there will be no dessert. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Mr President, President of the Commission, today was an important day, and Mr Barroso’s speech was an important one. I think you have achieved a good result, because you have established the three Cs: courage, credibility and confidence. It has been said here that the Community method is antiquated. However, the Community method has brought us many years of peace and prosperity. The Commission plays a vital role in that method; indeed, it lies at the very heart of it. It is therefore very significant that today, at this time of crisis and confusion when our people are asking for guidance, the President of the European Commission has made such a committed speech. Mr Barroso, you can count on Parliament’s political support when those commitments are turned into initiatives. I offer you my congratulations. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Madam President, I do not think this is the first debate we have held on this topic in Parliament. We had it in 2008, 2010 was the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion when we put forward a written declaration, and we are now putting an oral question to the Commission. What I mean is that, firstly, Parliament has always been concerned about this problem, which is a real one, because one often hears it said that we are preoccupied with institutional issues in which people are not interested. Institutional issues are important, but the issue of poverty is a genuine one and those of us who are present here tonight are demonstrating our concern. Secondly, it is true that – as the Commissioner has said – the action plans are essentially national plans. This is so. However, it is true that we can also do things at a European level. We did this – as Ms Berès will recall – when, at the insistence of this Parliament, we included the reference to social exclusion in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the struggle against poverty among the EU’s goals. I believe that very soon, we shall have the opportunity to take concrete action. I am referring to the debate and vote on the European Union budgets. These will take place very shortly and I think this will be an opportunity for demonstrating our commitment. The third point I should like to make, Madam President, is that it is very important to combat social exclusion and to combat poverty, but it is even more important to respect human dignity. A person suffering from poverty is one who possesses all the fundamental human rights, and we need to recognise this. Recently, I watched a film on Father Brezinski which I would recommend that my colleagues see, because this film demonstrates that the fight against inequalities is closely linked to the fight for dignity. Finally, Madam President, I would not wish to overlook one fact. From certain speeches, it would seem as if the defence of the European social model were the exclusive heritage of one particular political group in this Chamber. This is not the case. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and in all groups place great importance on the European social model, because this defines us, and because this is part of our identity. Therefore, I think that together – and both this question and the resolution show this – we will continue to fight for it to remain so. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

 Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon grants Parliament the power to initiate a reform of the Electoral Act, and therefore we have to do so. We also have to do so because, soon, the MEP seats in Parliament will be redistributed with the entry of Croatia. Therefore, the report by Mr Duff, whom I want to congratulate for the work he has done, is included in this field. The Electoral Act, as you know, dates back to 1976. A great deal of time has elapsed since then, and we therefore need to improve it. The debate taking place today is likely to focus on the pan-European list, and I say pan-European because my group has tabled an amendment along these lines that we will uphold, with all the more reason today, in honour of the recently deceased Archduke Otto von Habsburg, who used the term ‘Pan-Europe’. The pan-European list appears to raise serious doubts. Some people are telling us, ‘It is too soon.’ However, I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, that on 8 May 1950, an advisor told Chancellor Adenauer or Mr Schuman, ‘Minister, Chancellor, it is too early to make a Franco-German agreement to pool coal and steel.’ For conservatives, everything is always too soon. For those who want nothing to change, it is always too soon. For those of us in favour of progress, those who want Europe to move forward, we want to have high hopes, Madam President. One of William Faulkner’s characters said, in a very glorious way, ‘Our dreams must be like mountains so that, wherever we are, we can see them and pursue them.’ The transnational, pan-European list fits into this idea of dreams, ideals, poetry and struggle. Madam President, the style of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is to have the greatest possible consensus. We will seek the consensus needed to introduce it here. Nevertheless, as Paul Valéry said about every poem, ‘It is never finished; only abandoned.’ Today we are abandoning it, but we will come back to it, Madam President. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
). 
 – Madam President, Mr Kožušník, who is no longer here, said of my speech that I was in the mountains. Maybe, but I prefer to be in the mountains than to be in the past.  (FR)
 My colleague, Mrs Auconie, and Mr Kožušník, expressed how hard it is to explain to their constituents why we are dealing with institutional matters rather than real-life issues. It was a Frenchman, Jean Monnet, who explained that politics needs institutions. Commissioner, before this debate, we held another debate today on the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union. Let me tell you that with a little intelligence and ingenuity, anything is possible. At the end of the day, in response to the argument that the transnational European list would disadvantage the smaller States, we need to remember that the Presidents of the Commission have included Gaston Thorn and Jacques Santer. Mr Juncker is the President of the Euro Group. Are they from large countries? Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

 Mr President, when I first entered this House 20 years ago, this debate would not have taken place, because this House was a consultative parliament at the time, and many of us have battled over the last 20 years to make it what it is today, a co-legislator parliament. However, when one co-legislates, one must be responsible. It is an exercise in responsibility that is now in need. A part of this House has adopted the old May 1968 slogan, according to which it is realistic to demand the impossible. Obviously, if one demands the impossible, it ultimately becomes impossible to agree on anything. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has not negotiated with any individual groups. We have negotiated with all the groups. However, we have only reached agreements with those that were ready to do so. Mr President, it is my belief that much progress has undeniably been made with the Commission’s proposal, the Council’s position and what is now on the table – which will be put to the vote tomorrow – if they are examined objectively. This is the real controversy or dilemma that we will have to resolve tomorrow. At the end of his fruitful existence, Miguel de Cervantes said that there were moments in life when one must choose whether to be a road or an inn. By being an inn, Cervantes meant lying still, complaining that one is ignored and remaining static. Being a road means moving forward, overcoming obstacles, knowing that not all has been achieved, that the road is probably not the one we would like to be walking on, but going on walking all the same. This is what I believe this House should do tomorrow: walk on, resolve the differences we still have with the Council, but look towards a time when the crisis is hitting all Europeans. It is not responsible at this juncture to say ‘I am not happy with this, goodbye, have a nice day’. Responsibility means walking. Therefore, Mr President, I think that in tomorrow’s vote we will convene another meeting with the Council to be held in July. As another poet used to say – Mr Sosa Wagner has quoted a German poet, I will quote a French one, Paul Valéry – poems are never finished, they are simply abandoned. We will abandon the end result until July, and I hope that the Hungarian Presidency, which has proved so successful, will also be able to reach an agreement that satisfies everyone. Thank you, Mr President, and may I point out that this is the first time in 20 years that the clock has erred in my favour, giving me more time. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Mr President, we will not be going ahead with the vote on the Brok-Gualtieri report this morning: we will do it during the Brussels sitting. We will do it then in order to give Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri time to negotiate the conditions for applying Article 136 with the European Council. We are doing so because, as Mr Leinen said, the European Parliament is also der Hüter der Verträge
 – the guardian of the Treaties – and because we want the euro to function with everyone involved and with everyone committed; in the end, Mr President, we want it to be effective. That is what we asked for. It is not about any dispute between the institutions. It is not about gaining power for Parliament. It is about the result – the mechanism resulting from this – being effective for the European public. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,

Madam President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is going to vote enthusiastically in favour of this report, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council on this agreement. Ladies and gentlemen, in the 1980s we coined the phrase ‘democratic deficit’. By this we meant that in the European Union decisions were taken only by the Council of Ministers, based on Commission proposals, and that Parliament was only consulted. Parliament has been battling since the 1980s, through the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, the Constitutional Treaty and the Treaty of Lisbon, to close that democratic deficit, and I believe that through the Treaty of Lisbon, with Parliament’s new powers and the participation of national parliaments, we have achieved that objective. We are adding to that achievement today through this citizens’ initiative, which in the work of the Convention was due to the sound cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament. I would like to recall the following names here today: Jürgen Meyer, our German Social Democrat colleague, and Alain Lamassoure, who were responsible for bringing this initiative to the plenary of the Convention and getting it approved. I therefore believe that we have completed the circle, Madam President. I believe that today, when we adopt this initiative, we will have signed the death warrant of the idea of a ‘democratic deficit’. Now it is up to us to act responsibly, ladies and gentlemen, and today we also have the opportunity to do so. By adopting the Union budget we will be fulfilling the role that is expected of us: as a responsible Parliament with codecision powers. Ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is a good day for Europe. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,

Madam President, I joined Parliament 18 years ago now. Then, the European Parliament was a consultative parliament. It was a parliament that did not have any powers. In this process over the past 18 years, we have seen Parliament change from a consultative parliament to a fully colegislative one. Our good friend, Francisco Lucas Pires, who witnessed this process, said that it changed from a deliberative parliament to a legislative parliament. Therefore, the text that we are going to adopt on Wednesday is the culmination of negotiations between the Commission and Parliament on the framework agreement. I confess that when I tell my family that I am going to Strasbourg to take part in the debate on the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission, I have to give them quite a lengthy explanation. This is because, obviously, these things do not exist in national parliaments or at national level, so people do not understand why an agreement has to be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to implement what the treaties say. However, it does have to be done. It has to be done for a very basic reason, which Mr Rangel and Mr Šefčovič have already stated: because we want to be efficient. What the framework agreement is essentially seeking to do is to resolve all the practical obstacles that could arise in terms of legislation, parliamentary control and codes of conduct. I therefore believe that it is a good blend of European democracy. It is ‘consensual’ democracy rather than the ‘conflictive’ democracy that we have in our countries. In consensual democracy, the intelligent thing to do is to find solutions to any problems that could arise. Therefore, the framework agreement is an instrument for preventing future problems and making what the treaties say a reality. As we have a new treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, it makes sense to implement it. I would like to congratulate Mr Rangel and the team that he led, and the European Commission, because I believe that they have reached a very reasonable agreement. When reading the content of the agreement, one cannot fail to be surprised at the voices being heard in some national parliaments questioning whether it poses a threat to the Council’s powers. For goodness’ sake! The Council is indeed the other colegislator. We do want to legislate, and we are legislating a great deal and successfully with the Council of Ministers. We are colegislators on an equal footing. We do not need to gain any sort of small advantage. What we want is for this to be effective, and I believe that the agreement is going to help to achieve this. Allow me to say, Mr Šefčovič, that you took the bull by the horns – a very bullfighting-related expression in my country – when you said that the interpretation of Articles 6 and 7 of the resolution is Parliament’s interpretation in relation to international agreements and international conferences. I do not believe there is anything strange here. What we are talking about here is Parliament being informed and participating through the Commission and through negotiation, nothing more. What is the purpose? The purpose is for us to know what the Commission has done when we have to adopt it here. Therefore – and I will finish here Madam President – congratulations to both of you. I believe that this is a good omen: as they would say in Casablanca, 
‘the beginning of a beautiful friendship’. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, on 14 February 2008, as a Valentine’s gift, the Conference of Presidents decided that the intergroups would only meet on Thursdays. Since then, we have been trying to resolve this issue. We have not managed to do so. Now the intergroups have to meet on an unsuitable date. They almost never have rooms and they never have interpretation. I am speaking today not only as the Chair of the Intergroup on Poverty and Human Rights, but with a mandate from the majority of the intergroups in this House, and therefore from the Members of this House who are part of those intergroups. I formally ask the Conference of Presidents to reconsider and to revoke the decision of 14 February 2008, going back to the previous situation of giving freedom to the intergroups. If it does not do so, I would like to say respectfully that we will bring the matter to Parliament’s plenary session, which will decide who is sovereign in this House, which is Parliament. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, Mr Leterme, I would congratulate you on your speech: it was an excellent presentation of this Presidency. I believe that we can already draw one, or even more than one, conclusion from this morning’s debate: firstly, that this House – those of us who want to build Europe, those of us who want to think positively about Europe – supports your Presidency and supports the efforts that you will be making. Furthermore, being aware of the difficulties within your government, I would like to thank you doubly, as it is all the more difficult for you to have come here today with this ambitious programme. We offer you our heartfelt thanks. Secondly, concentrate on resolving the economic issues. I believe that we have a great opportunity at the moment. I believe that we are on the point of reaching agreement on the issues relating to financial supervision. Concentrate on that. Thirdly, make the Trio work. I believe that the Trio of Presidencies is the great innovation of the Treaty of Lisbon. Let it not be a gimmick, let it be a reality, and let us do what the founding fathers said: think and act – in this case, Spaniards, Belgians and Hungarians – as Europeans. Thank you very much, Mr Leterme, and good luck! Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. 
– (ES)
 Madam President, I believe that there can only be two solutions for resolving the financial crisis that we have experienced: either we give more powers to national supervisors, or we create a European supervisor and give powers to it. I am glad, Madam President, that at this moment, Parliament is firmly committed, politically committed, to European supervision, and I believe that there is great consensus on this among all political groupings. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs will support, and has supported, all institutional measures that move in this direction. It seems to me at the moment, Madam President, that once this commitment becomes manifest tomorrow, the Commission has a first order function in negotiations with the Council. During these negotiations, it seems to me that the key point will be whether these European authorities will be able to deal with companies affected directly at national level if the national supervisor is not involved. Therefore, Commissioner, the best of luck with this task, which I believe to be a determining factor for the future of supervision and capital, at this time, for those of us who would like more Europe. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, when you attended a meeting of the European Economic and Social Committee, Mr Van Rompuy, you used a beautiful image. You said that in the economic and financial crisis, we had wanted to build life rafts during the voyage. This was indeed the case, as the Economic and Financial Affairs Council that preceded the last European Council meeting took certain measures that were unthinkable in some countries, one of which I know very well. What we therefore need to do is ensure that this does not happen again in the future and therefore, that we build the life rafts in advance. I listened very carefully to what you said. You mentioned ‘a strict supervision of the national budgets’. I agree. Then, however, you added that there was no question whatsoever of the Commission supervising the national budgets before they were approved by the national parliaments. Well, I heard you say this to Commissioner Rehn. Moreover, I think it is a good idea and one that we should explore. ‘De l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace
’, as a French revolutionary would say. I have no problem at all, President Van Rompuy, with being under the protection of the European Union. I prefer to be under the protection of the European Union than under the protection of rulers whose method of government involves constantly changing course and improvising. We are therefore going to pursue any possibilities that we have. Secondly, it has been said here by some Members that as they are not in the euro, they do not care what happens to the euro. Well, I am concerned about what happens to the national currencies that are not in the euro, because that is being European. If, at any point, those currencies are in difficulties, it will concern me, because they will affect the economy that belongs to all of us. Mr President, one last aside. I know that, in times of crisis, it is more difficult to talk about fighting poverty, because there are fewer resources. I believe, however, that what has made us greater as Europeans is fighting against social exclusion and poverty. I ask that 2010, which is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, should not be simply one more conclusion of the European Council. President of the Commission, let us make active policies in this area. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

 Madam President, more than 20 years ago – in fact 23 years ago – I was fortunate enough to witness the signing of an agreement in the other parliament building between the then President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, and the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Marcelino Oreja, for what were then the European Communities to sign up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. That was 23 years ago. This reminds me of the answer that the poet Heinrich Heine gave when he was asked, ‘Where would you like to die?’ He replied, ‘In England, because there everything happens 100 years later’. Based on some speeches that we have heard, it seems that everything happens 200 years later, Madam President. I trust, however, that Mr Duff’s influence in the new Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition government will improve this situation. Therefore, Madam President, my Group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), has been in favour of this accession for a long time now, and we warmly welcome the excellent report by Mr Jáuregui. It is his first report and I am sure that it will not be his last. We are doing so because we feel that it will increase guarantees for the public, because what we are doing is giving more guarantees to people that the European Union legislation applied by the Member States and European Union laws is in line with the set of rights recognised in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. This report opens the way for resolving many of the technical legal problems that are going to arise, because we must not forget that the convention was designed to be ratified and applied by Member States. Whatever the propaganda from some sides of this House, the European Union is not a state or a super-state. It is an international organisation, and therefore, there are difficulties in adjusting an international organisation to something that was made for states. Mrs Giannakou, who was our shadow rapporteur and did an excellent job for which I sincerely thank her, will talk about the specific issues. All I want to do now is join Vice-President Reding in calling for the Council to give the Commission a mandate to negotiate swiftly, and I am sure that my friend, Mr López Garrido, will ensure that this is the case. This will mean, Madam President, that soon we will be able to celebrate the European Union signing up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, I would like to clarify two things. Firstly, the articles that are in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that are also in the European Convention on Human Rights are the same and mean the same thing: Articles 52 and 53 of the Charter; there is therefore no contradiction. Secondly, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights is supranational. Therefore, if someone wants to apply to it due to a European Union decision or the application of Union law, they will first have to apply to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling. I understand that Europhobes always want to vote against Europe, but at least out of parliamentary courtesy, they should read Mr Jáuregui’s report, which sets everything out clearly. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, please allow me to begin my speech with a line from Rilke: ‘Herr, es ist Zeit. Der Sommer war sehr groß...
’.
 Rilke was the favourite poet of our recently deceased fellow Member, Dimitris Tsatsos. Some time ago now, on 19 November 1997, Dimitris Tsatsos and I had the honour of submitting the report on the Treaty of Amsterdam to this House. It was in that very report on the Treaty of Amsterdam that we proposed that any amendment to Treaties be prepared beforehand by a Convention. We called that the Community method. Indeed, it is that Convention method that was used in preparing the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, above all, the Constitutional Treaty. I wish to remember Dimitris Tsatsos today in particular, as we are on the threshold of carrying out the first reform of the Treaty of Lisbon, which, in the last analysis, Mr President, is the Constitutional Treaty for which we fought so hard. That first reform, which is going to consist of the amendment of Protocol (No 36) of the Treaty of Lisbon, is caused by an anomaly because, at the time the elections to this Parliament were held in June last year, the Treaty of Lisbon had not come into force owing to the vicissitudes with which we are all familiar. Consequently, the last parliamentary elections were held under the Treaty of Nice, which was in force at that time, and said Treaty of Nice provides for the existence of 736 MEPs, as opposed to the 751 provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. To complicate matters even further, Mr President, the 1976 Act lays down that an MEP’s mandate lasts for five years. This means that we cannot now simply apply the number laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely the 751 MEPs, given that under Lisbon a certain country loses three Members who have been elected and, therefore, cannot leave Parliament during this parliamentary term. That, Mr President, is why Protocol (No 36) has to be amended in order to enable the Lisbon agreements to come into force, and why during this parliamentary term, 2009-2014, when the amendment of Protocol (No 36) comes into force, this Parliament will, exceptionally, have 754 Members. That is why, Mr President, the European Council addressed a letter to you asking that, in accordance with Article 48(2) of the Treaty, this Parliament give its opinion on two questions. The first question is whether or not a Convention is necessary in order to prepare the amendment to Protocol (No 36). The second is whether or not the Heads of State or Government can call an Intergovernmental Conference to amend Protocol (No 36). Both questions are linked, although they are dealt with in two different reports. I will begin with the calling of an Intergovernmental Conference. As I have said, we are dealing with the political result of applying the Treaty of Lisbon and we are also dealing with a transitional and exceptional solution that will only last for the duration of this parliamentary term. Therefore, that Intergovernmental Conference will confine itself to something that has already been agreed: how to distribute those 18 MEPs among 12 countries. Consequently, Mr President, there is no debate. I believe that the Intergovernmental Conference can be very quickly called and can even resolve the issue in a single morning, given that the political decision has already been taken. For that reason, I am going to ask for a ‘yes’ vote for an Intergovernmental Conference and say that I do not believe that a Convention is required for an issue that has already been resolved. We are in favour of holding the Intergovernmental Conference; we are against calling a Convention. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, when people coming from positions as different and far-removed as those of Mr Mauro, Mr Gollnisch and Mr Colman come to the conclusion that there are problems with the electoral procedure and systems for the election of MEPs to the European Parliament, it means that we need a uniform electoral procedure. That was a mandate that already existed in the Treaties of Rome. Therefore, we coordinators – and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them, most especially Mr Jáuregui and Mr Duff – have agreed on Amendment 2, which will be voted on tomorrow. I hope that this amendment will be supported by this House, particularly so that we can soon resolve this issue of a uniform electoral procedure for elections to the European Parliament. By means of this, we would, it seems to me, remove this type of question mark. In his speech, Mr Trzaskowski spoke about the necessary representativeness of this Parliament, something that the majority of the speakers and Vice-President Šefčovič, among others, have also highlighted. I agree. Indeed, we say as much in paragraph 1 of the report, to the extent that the 18 MEPs should enter en bloc
, otherwise we would lose representativeness. In order for them to enter en bloc
, in order to comply with this act of political justice that is the Treaty of Lisbon, we have to be practical, because a transitional and exceptional situation, ladies and gentlemen, also requires transitional and exceptional situations and solutions. This is why, and I am quite open about it, I do not like the possibility of MEPs joining this Parliament who were not elected in 2009, something which, by the way, I clearly state in paragraph 2 of the report. Nevertheless, if I have to choose between that and the 18 Members not taking their seats, or coming up with a practical solution and the 18 joining, meaning therefore that we comply with the Treaty of Lisbon, I ask this House, as I have already done in the report, to choose that solution; a transitional and pragmatic one but, above all, Madam President, a just one. I would like to thank everyone for their collaboration and for the interesting contributions that were made to this report. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,

 Mr President, it was in this very House, almost seven years ago, at the end of the constitutional convention, when we Members of the European Parliament and members of the national parliaments succeeded in putting forward a proposal that was accepted by the Presidium. I had the honour of taking it to the Presidium and we approved it. Furthermore, I wish to recall here the names of Mr Lamassoure and Mr Mayer, because it was they who drew up the Citizens’ Initiative proposal, a popular initiative that is today incorporated into the treaties. A popular initiative that is an example of participatory democracy – Mr Šefčovič has explained this very well – and of European democracy, because the issues that need to be covered by this initiative must be European issues, not local issues. Participation by citizens, therefore, and issues dealt with at European level. Mr Šefčovič, who is preparing this proposal, has not told us what it involves. He has left us with our mouths watering. On behalf of my group, Mr Šefčovič, I would ask that it contain at least three ideas. Firstly, that it should be clear and simple. In other words, do not let us make things complicated. It must be something accessible to the people, so that they can participate without having had to have gone to university. Secondly, that it should provide for cooperation between the European authorities and the national authorities, because, in my opinion, the national authorities must play an important role in the way signatures are organised. Thirdly, that we should educate, through the European Commission and through Parliament, by explaining how this legislative initiative may be used to avoid disappointments. I will give you an example of this that I saw on the Internet. An online petition has already been launched to use the popular initiative to make it possible to change the seat of Parliament so that there is only one. Well, this is impossible and we must say so from the start; it calls for reform in the treaties and cannot be dealt with by the popular initiative. There is, therefore, a lot of educating to be done, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, and of Parliament, in an initiative that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) endorses and hopes may serve to promote the sense of belonging to the Union and public participation in the Union’s business.

Mr President, I had the same concern as that expressed by the rapporteur. I think that in order for the vote to proceed properly on Wednesday, in the case of such an important report, we need to know in advance which amendments you consider to be inadmissible. I therefore accept what you said, and we would like to have them tomorrow. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would like to return to the subject of the admissibility of amendments, which you referred to before. Pursuant to Rule 157(3), it is up to you, but I would ask you, Mr President, to take into account the wise words of the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Casini. I do not think it can be left in the hands of the Parliament’s services to determine which amendments relate to the Treaty of Lisbon and which do not. Moreover, this House has the sovereign right to decide whether or not an amendment is necessary, at this time when, as everyone has said, a new phase is beginning. Mr President, I would ask you, therefore, to use the considerable power granted to you under the Rules of Procedure in moderation, and with your usual prudence. May you make the right decision, and may we all see it. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, the President of the European Commission was saying that he congratulated Mr Reinfeldt on having brought the ship safely to harbour, the ship in question being the Treaty of Lisbon. Two years ago, in this House, I was saying that I was afraid that the Treaty of Lisbon might end up like the fish in The Old Man and the Sea,
 Hemingway’s novella, which, after a long battle, arrived at the harbour almost as a pile of bones. Well, I can see that the Treaty of Lisbon has not arrived at harbour as a pile of bones, but that its essence is still there. Thank you, Mr Reinfeldt; thank you, Cecilia. I must say, however, that I believe that what you have done, in seeking the agreement with the President of the Czech Republic, is right. Many of us in this House were troubled by the behaviour of the President of the Czech Republic, but there is a Spanish poet who says: ‘after everything, everything has been nothing’; in the end, the important thing is that the treaty is in force and that now we are thinking about the implementation of the treaty. Mr Barroso, it is not my intention either to give you any advice on how you ought to form your Commission, partly because I respect the autonomy and independence of the President of the Commission, who has received a substantial vote asking him to do this. When you present your college of Commissioners and the division of responsibilities, we will tell you whether we are for or against, but today, you have our full support. Neither do I intend to give any advice, clearly, to the President-in-Office of the Council, but, if you will permit me, I would like to point out to you something that happened during the work done on the constitutional treaty. In the first draft, which created the post of the President of the Council, there was a proposal that this Council President should be a prime minister who had been in office for at least two and a half years (as a joke, Mr Reinfeldt, we called it the ‘Bruton clause’, after John Bruton, because John told us that he had been prime minister for two years and seven months, and therefore would be eligible for the post). However, we later removed this condition – Mr Duff remembers – and we removed it because in this Parliament, we were asked what there was in the DNA of a prime minister that was not possessed by other mortals’ DNA. Why must the President of the Council be a prime minister? Mr Reinfeldt, you should rather seek out the person who can best represent moral authority, who can be the broker of agreements in Europe. In order to do this, we have given you a tool, Mr Reinfeldt: it is the fact that the election of this President of the Council does not have to be unanimous, but may be by qualified majority. Therefore, consensus is desirable, if it is possible; if not, use the qualified majority to seek out the best President of the Council. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us imagine that tonight, when this interminable debate finishes, we go out and we meet 27 fellow Members downstairs and we have to decide unanimously which restaurant we are going to. If we negotiate this obstacle, then imagine that the 27 of us have to choose the same thing to eat, and that the 27 of us also have to decide whether or not to have wine. Mr President, this metaphor, which comes from someone who is on a diet, provides a good illustration of the current situation of the European Union and what the Treaty of Lisbon brings in: in my view, it is the most important thing, namely eliminating the requirement for unanimity. If those of us who have spoken here all want the European Union to function properly, to be effective, to produce added value for the people, then the first thing that needs to be done is to replace the requirement for unanimity with a requirement for super-qualified majorities. That is the most significant achievement of the Treaty of Lisbon. Opposing the Treaty of Lisbon means not wanting Europe to function properly or to have an important role in the world. Mr President, I do not understand, and it is a source of regret for me, how some fellow Members who have freely entered this Parliament can have more confidence in the Council of Ministers than in the European Parliament. In addition, these are people who will never be in the Council of Ministers. Why do they believe that their interests are better defended by the Council of Ministers than by this Parliament, where they are present and where they can vote? Mr President, another thing I do not understand is why a certain fellow Member said that what they want is to take their country – and this is a legitimate view – out of the European Union. In that case, ladies and gentlemen, it is necessary to be in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon, because the Treaty of Lisbon establishes, for the first time, an exit clause. Now, in truth, it is necessary to have the courage and the ambition to say to their people that it is necessary to leave the European Union. That is also something that I would like to see. Mr President, to sum up, I believe that through the result of the Irish referendum we are completing the process. Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Rouček and Mr Brok – who are concerned by the attitude of the President of the Czech Republic – that I have no doubts. I have no doubts because a person who refused to sign what had been adopted by the Chambers that elected him, a person who refused to sign the Treaty, would be like the Queen of England refusing to sign a law from Westminster. That is not possible. I am also certain that someone as patriotic as Mr Klaus would not want to see his country engulfed in an internal constitutional crisis. Mr President, I therefore believe that the time has come to join forces, for us to realise that the world is not waiting for us, the Europeans, and that either we Europeans must unite and maintain constructive positions regarding the problems that our citizens are experiencing at the moment, or else Europe, as a power, will disappear from the map. Mr President, that is what I believe that we must now do, in unity, as Europeans and as Parliament. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, I believe that one of the conclusions of this debate is that when things are explained, when there is discussion with people, when there is communication, when lies are denied, then greater participation and greater backing for the European project are achieved. Therefore, I venture, along the lines of what many speakers have said, to make a positive, constructive contribution, and to ask the European Commission to consider whether, in the make-up of the new Commission, the duties of the Commissioner for Human Rights should not be included within a wider portfolio such as the Commissioner for Citizenship, to include communication, which is vitally necessary in order to be able to communicate well, to explain well, and to be able to begin a genuine dialogue on our European project.

 Mr President, the seriousness of the situation undoubtedly means that the forthcoming European Council to be held on 28 and 29 June will be perceived differently by Europeans, as a starting point in the efforts to build a new structure for the European Union. It cannot therefore simply involve the proposed freezing of a series of measures and initiatives that people do not understand. Instead, we need to be able to find sufficient symbols and unequivocal signs in this Council that a new era is dawning in the European Union. A plan needs to be decided upon, with a timetable and priorities, and, above all, short-term measures need to be as important as medium and long-term measures. We are all aware of the areas where action needs to be taken. The Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, has recently sent the President of the Council and the President of the Commission an action plan with five measures. What we wish to highlight, however, is the need for a new European structure that can bring an end to the instability and turbulence that we are currently experiencing. Jaime Mayor Oreja,

 Mr President, I shall not waste too much time describing the decision and procedures undertaken by the Argentine Government in its expropriation of YPF-Repsol. As I said yesterday, however, arbitrariness, legal uncertainty and illegitimacy are some of the terms that this decision merits. We are therefore facing a violation of rights and principles, appalling political and economic practice, and a worrying precedent, which means that this incident affects all Europeans. This is not, therefore, a dispute merely between Spain and Argentina. That is why today, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to stress what Europeans – the European institutions – can do, as well as why, what for and how, when this kind of decision is taken, which weakens the principles and, undoubtedly, the freedoms I have just mentioned, with the aim being that this type of action is never repeated. Allow me to express two ideas. The first is that in times and situations of crisis such as we are currently experiencing, the weaknesses of everyone, national governments and national institutions of the different countries, both inside and outside the EU, tend to increase; this is a reminder that the EU’s strength is its reason for being, and that the best instrument with which to alleviate the difficulties and weaknesses of the Member States should be the Union’s strength. That is the EU’s main purpose. My second idea is this: the crisis involves us all and is present in every European country; although it might appear momentarily that it is settling in one country or another, it is, in fact, our very model that is in crisis and, if it is not resolved, that crisis spreads slowly, gradually and systematically throughout all the countries. That is why one of the deep-rooted causes of this crisis is the EU’s lack of political ambition, and therefore the different manifestations of the crisis at hand should serve as opportunities so that the European voice can be clearly heard when this kind of injustice endangers the investments and future of the European institutions. I therefore welcome the determination shown by Mr Wammen, Mr Tajani, Baroness Ashton and Mr Barroso, who have proven that they are examining measures with which to tackle this situation. The more planned, strategic and organised measures we adopt, the greater and better our response will be to this crisis.

 Mr President, the climate crisis cannot be used as an argument to cover up an injustice of this kind. The fact that we are experiencing harmful climate change should in no way allow us to hide the injustices, arbitrariness and legal uncertainties that are taking place in a country such as Argentina. One day, we shall have the debate you want on climate change and – you are not really listening to me – on the crisis of values and principles that we are having in the EU and European countries. We can talk about climate change and the crisis of values whenever you like, but today we must address an injustice that is being carried out in Argentina, which is damaging European prospects and investments in the countries of that region. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

 Mr President, there is one principle that we should defend both inside and outside the European Union, and that is the principle of legal certainty. Arbitrariness is an aspect of this that we should be able to face up to and fight against, both inside and outside the European Union. When a decision is dominated by legal uncertainty and arbitrariness, that constitutes an unlawful action which affects thousands of small shareholders and which, most of all, sets a bad precedent for many European investments around the world. We therefore maintain that this debate is necessary and essential, not only for Spain and for a Spanish company, but also as a future reference for the many European investments made outside our borders. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

 Madam President, the European Council has adopted a series of measures covering governance, budgetary rationalisation, competitiveness and so on and I must say that they are all along the right lines. The European Council’s 16 points are largely due to the work of President Van Rompuy and President Barroso, to whom I first of all offer my congratulations, because I do value – some of us do value – what you have done as leaders of the institutions. However, the problem is that not only are we going through a financial crisis, we are also experiencing a crisis of confidence and a political crisis in Europe and in the European nations. The problem is not simply one of assessing the actual economic and technical contents of the European Council. At the same time as there are meetings of the European Council, European, national and regional elections are being held and all of these confirm our apprehensions. Extreme positions are being adopted. Some of these positions are currently taking refuge in forms of nationalism. Therefore, you must be very well aware that our problem is not simply to face up to the crisis, but to face up to the political and social consequences of that crisis. It is not simply a time when there is, as a fellow Member quite rightly said, a north-south crisis in the European Union. These are new times and a particular feature of new times is that crises mount up and proliferate and are not resolved. They turn up unexpectedly, both inside and outside the EU. Moreover, these new times basically demand new ways of thinking at both individual and institutional levels, and that is the major political challenge that faces us. Any change in one’s personal way of thinking starts with that person him or herself. First of all, if that person is a Member of this House, he or she must say in what ways Parliament must change if it is to deal with new times. The same goes for members of the Commission and the Council; each and every one of us must be able to face up to this issue. However, in any case, the main thing is not to go off course, because you are heading in the right direction. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

Mr President, the attacks that have recently taken place in Iraq and Egypt are evidence of two tragedies for Europe, albeit of a different nature. Firstly, it is a tragedy that the events themselves have taken place, due to their cruelty and the loss of human life. Secondly, however, it is also a tragedy to see how too often they go unnoticed in our society. In many cases, the way in which we act means that these events are confined to the accident and crime reports in the media, as if they were something external rather than an attack against us. It is as if they were happening somewhere else when, in fact, these attacks are taking place at the heart of and against the core of our civilisation, our Europe. The role of the European institutions is, fundamentally, to raise awareness regarding the seriousness, the significance and the scope of the attacks against Christians in these places. The European institutions should not only issue generic statements condemning these attacks, but should also promote action along two lines: firstly, ensuring that this tragedy is more present in our societies and our media, and secondly, ensuring that the European institutions are more present where the tragedy is taking place. With this objective and with these two lines of action, allow me to say, Baroness Ashton, that the European institutions and you yourself must promote the important role of the victims of these events. The victims need to be given faces. The victims need to be present in our European institutions. We need to prepare a programme of visits, meetings and even material support for the victims, but it is the victims of this terrible persecution themselves who will do much better than we can to defend their cause. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE

Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, these first six months following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon required and merited a change in political attitude. If the economic and financial crisis has been a consequence of the move away from the ‘real’ economy and the disordered development of the ‘unreal’ economy, the same can be said in a political context. On 20 January, in this Parliament, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero announced the four – not two – priorities of his Presidency: first, the common market for energy; second, investment in the information society; third, a sustainable economy or industry, with a plan for developing an electric vehicle; fourth, the completion of the Bologna higher education area. I ask myself, to what extent does this statement of objectives approach the reality that we have lived through? During his first speech, when he put forward his objectives, he did not mention the words ‘deficit’ or ‘debt’ once. The entire Presidency changed radically at the Ecofin meeting on 9 and 10 May of this year, and the euro crisis came to light. He continued to be late and unsuccessful. Necessary measures had to be improvised in the European Union due to the lack of foresight and depth in the diagnosis of the crisis. There was an additional difficulty: because of the results of his economic policy, the person holding the rotating Presidency was not in a position to participate in the leadership required for a solution, as he had become part of the problem. While rotating presidencies are, without a doubt, different following the treaty, in such an acute situation of economic crisis, either they assert themselves, or else they are even more limited and weighed down by the lack of confidence in, and the lack of credibility of, their economic policies within their respective countries, as in this case. Mr President, the greatest crisis that we politicians are living through is that of confidence. A crisis of confidence of such magnitude can only be resolved if we dare to tell the truth. We can find a description of the third fiction of this Presidency within this morning’s speech, in which it seemed that the President was only interested in extolling this Presidency. The question that we must ask ourselves is whether we will be capable of not going back to improvising or, instead, whether we will be able to diagnose and foresee the specific crisis scenario that will have a social dimension. (Applause) Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I believe that the worst crisis that we could suffer is not only the one that we are currently suffering, but the one that we will suffer if we are not capable of learning the right political lessons regarding what is happening. We have been living beyond our means, especially in some countries. We have moved away from the real economy and embraced the fictional economy, in our public accounts and, at the same time, in our family and private lives. We have not been capable of understanding that, as is the case for any living organism, growing is not the same thing as getting fat. Growth requires effort and proportion, while the process of getting fat involves a lack of proportion and balance in comparison with the work that we do and the welfare that we enjoy. This crisis does not remain static. The picture of the crisis a few months ago was a different one, a completely different one, to the picture that we have today. The picture of the crisis in a few months is going to be a different one to the picture that we have today. This crisis was economic and financial, and will have a growing social dimension involving social conflict. This means that while we are in this phase, before the conflict becomes a social one, those of us involved in politics need to be aware that our main crisis is a crisis of confidence. It is not only a crisis of the euro. Let us analyse all the political and electoral processes in recent months. There is a crisis of confidence, and that means that what we need to ask ourselves is how we need to change, how our attitude needs to change: our political, institutional and personal attitude. In this respect, instead of thinking about other institutions, the question that Parliament needs to ask itself is what contribution it can make to a change of institutional and political attitude in this House. I dare say that today, having heard many reasons for the crisis – bureaucracy, agencies, governments – there are two issues on which we need to change. Firstly, Europe requires a minimum level of cohesion from Parliament: it cannot bleed itself dry in such a profound debate on two concepts of European society. Secondly, we need to dare to tell the truth about what is happening to us. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE

Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to express my wholehearted, firm and unreserved support to Mr Barroso. This is based not only on what he has said today, but also on speeches he has made in Parliament that have encouraged us to support him more strongly and significantly than ever. I would like to say that the main reason for that support is not the number of Commissioners that our Group, or our political family, has in the Commission, but rather it is fundamentally the belief that this is a unique and distinct time for the European Union. This Commission is not just any Commission and this Parliament is not just any Parliament, not only because of the Treaty of Lisbon, but also because we are experiencing a crisis that is unprecedented in the European Union: an economic and social crisis. We do not think that the Treaty of Lisbon is the most important thing. The most important thing is for there to be a change of attitude in terms of steering all the European institutions towards greater political ambition. We therefore unreservedly support the Commission led by Mr Barroso. We also support the Commission because, whilst we are currently experiencing an economic and financial crisis, we are going to move onto another phase: the social crisis. The differences between some countries and others are going to increase, and there is going to be increased social unrest. The economic and social crisis is undoubtedly going to cause increased social unrest. Another reason is that we are experiencing a crisis of values, making it essential that all of us, not just the Commission, change our personal attitudes. We all need to change our attitude. Our Group therefore believes that the best way to change, to transform and to improve is to support the European Commission led by Mr Barroso. I therefore think that in the context of this task, and of the work that we have to do, the PPE Group is the group that wants us all to change the most. The European Parliament also needs to change. The Commission alone cannot be held responsible for the frequent lack of unity in this House, which is largely the reason why there is no European voice in the world. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President of the Spanish Government, I would like to say to you that we are not living in just another period, we are not living in just any moment in and for the European Union. What you and Chair Daul said is true: the European Union and the European people know that their main concern is the crisis. It also needs to be pointed out here today, however, that before the economic crisis, in various elections in which there was a low turnout, Europeans were also showing signs of a growing disinterest and distance from the European institutions. Therefore, the crisis of values has manifested itself before and also during the European integration project. I want to say this to you because, in view of the obvious impetus which will be provided by the Treaty of Lisbon, we have our first opportunity to reduce this rift between the European people and the European institutions. We are therefore living – or at least we should be living – in a period of transition and of change, which you referred to. I would like to say, however, that the first challenge that we have ahead of us is to be able to find the turning point in the process of Europeans becoming distanced from European policy. Transitions are always an opportunity. They are also a risk, but I obviously encourage you to have a small number of clear ideas that can always be communicated to all Europeans. I would therefore like to say that a change in attitude in all the European institutions, in all of us and in the national governments and parliaments, in politicians, is undoubtedly much more important than the Treaty of Lisbon itself. It is not enough for the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force in order for us to be able to talk about transition and change in the European Union and ambition in the European project. I therefore want to say to you that the prime ambition is for Europeans to understand us better, as they do not understand us. Our language is unintelligible and, at times, incomprehensible, and we therefore have to know how to say that this is a problem in itself and a challenge in itself, so that we can move closer to the European people. We need to devote much more time, much more political energy and much more political impetus to ensuring that Europeans can understand us. Ladies and gentlemen, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, all the presidencies are going to be distinct, different and more demanding, and they are going to demand more sacrifice and more generosity from us than ever. I therefore would like to say that I am very pleased to say here today that the Spanish Partido Popular
 has supported the objectives of the Spanish Government in the European Presidency at such an important time for the European Union. What we need to do now is to apply them in the right way. I am going to tell you how the Spanish Presidency should not be measured. It is not going to be measured by the number of meetings that we hold. The measure of a good Presidency is not conventional speeches or great words, or common places. It will be measured by the results, the realities, our capacity to change our attitude – in all the European institutions – and our capacity to prioritise the real problems that Europeans have. This will be the only way that we will truly move closer to all Europeans. (Applause) Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE

Madam President, Commission President, I want to make a preliminary comment. We cannot have the same debate after elections as before elections, out of respect for the elections and for the European people. We should not do things any differently from what happens in the national parliaments in this respect. If the European Commissioners are the result of a majority in each country, our main concern should be that the Commission President is faithful to what the European people have voted for in the European elections, hence the importance and correctness of Mr Barroso becoming Commission President. This is a strictly democratic principle. There are two points which Mr Barroso made and which I do not have any doubts in clearly and definitively supporting. The first is the extent of the diagnosis of the current situation, which he gave in his speech and comments. We are not only experiencing an economic and financial crisis, but also a crisis of values. This is the first time that I have heard in this House any confirmation of these characteristics. We are not only experiencing a crisis, but also a changing world. That is why, more than ever before, the emphasis must be placed on positive action by individuals and on a change of attitude towards the State and the markets, because we have probably lived beyond our means in many EU countries. The second point, which I also support, is Mr Barroso’s European ambition. Europe needs to elect, prioritise and organise, and the crisis and the Treaty of Lisbon are the two main issues on which the Commission President must particularly concentrate. Tackling the crisis requires a determined Commission and also a Parliament which is capable of tackling the serious circumstances that we are experiencing. The crisis is not yet over and its landscape is still unrecognisable. It is also forcing us to deal with social inequalities in the European Union. We therefore need the political ambition that you have shown this afternoon, Mr Barroso. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again the horrific images from the Middle East have shaken us all. More than 35 children were among the 140 victims in the Gaza Strip; six people have been executed as alleged Israeli collaborators; a number of Israeli citizens have also killed by hundreds of rockets made in Iran; there has been an attack against civilians today in Tel Aviv; 45 000 reserve troops have been mobilised; and a ceasefire seems to have been confirmed, or so Mr Cohn-Bendit has just told me, after frantic diplomatic activity: mediation by the President of Egypt; phone calls by the President of the United States; visit to the region by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and US Secretary of State; involvement of the Arab League ministers; French-Qatari plan; and threat of a resolution on Syria in the United Nations Security Council. Of course, Mr President, in this case words are not enough as the situation is so serious. There is a great deal of impotence and frustration after the trite condemnation of the Council of Ministers the day before yesterday, and I believe that the most important thing is to achieve, and consolidate, a ceasefire that is guaranteed by the United Nations, and that protects the civilian population and supports the moderates. We saw the alternative, Mr President, in 2008: 1 400 victims. We are only too aware that the circumstances are not the best: fragmentation and division within the Palestinian cause, elections in Israel in January and, of course, a nuclear escalation in Iran. Therefore, President-in-Office of the Council, what Europe must do is support unreservedly this ceasefire to prevent the worst from happening. However, we must not fool ourselves, Mr President, into thinking that there can be stability in the area, stability in the region, unless we tackle the deep-seated causes and injustices that are fuelling the hatred and violence in that troubled part of the Middle East. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

– (ES) 
Mr President, when the negotiating guidelines were adopted, the European Union – its 27 Member States, the Commission and this Parliament – had a commitment from Israel dating back to 2005.  Israel is a partner of the European Union and an essential participant in the peace process, even if we dislike the decisions that have been taken with regard to settlements and in spite of the fact that some of the decisions taken by the Israeli Government undeniably violate the rights of the Palestinian people.  After the elections in the United States, the peace process negotiations will be revived, and it is clear that the European Union cannot be excluded from this process. The European Union and this Parliament therefore need to honour their commitments and adopt this agreement.  Mr President, the interpretative amendment that has been tabled to the draft legislative resolution is clearly in violation of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, as Rule 83 states quite clearly that no amendments may be tabled to a draft legislative resolution.  Parliament is entitled to express its opinion through non-legislative resolutions and, in any case, the acceptance of this amendment sets a worrying precedent, which, if this decision is not reversed, is likely to be the subject of an appeal before the Court of Justice, leaving those who tabled and accepted the amendment in a sticky situation. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

– (ES)
 Mr President, I would like to make a clarification concerning the oral amendment presented by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Normally, my group strictly fulfils the commitments that it signs at the negotiating table, and the terms of negotiation, Mr President, state that the European Union will take appropriate and responsible measures. Clearly, included in those measures are humanitarian measures, as was reflected in the debate that we had with Baroness Ashton the other day, concerning the situation in Syria. Therefore, the addition of this word is superfluous because it is already included in the terms. Mr President, my group is opposed to the inclusion of this word. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Brok, on this report on the state of the common foreign and security policy, which cannot be separated from the times that the EU is living in with regard to the debt crisis, the euro crisis and the crisis in European integration. Baroness Ashton, as a bloc we may be the leading global importer of goods and services, we may be the leading global exporter of goods and services, and we may be the leading donor of humanitarian aid, tripling the aid donated by the United States, but what credibility do we have on the international stage, despite your efforts and our own, if we are not capable of solving internal problems with due care and in an effective manner? The new European External Action Service and the new common foreign and security policy have come into being at the most complex time and in the deepest crisis the EU has experienced since it was founded. It is clear that if we want to have a coherent, visible and effective common foreign and security policy, we need to try to answer the questions raised by Mr Brok in his introduction. How do we defend human rights in an international community that considers our Charter of Fundamental Rights to be a westernised view of the world? How do we reconcile the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, laid down in the United Nations Charter, with the principle of the responsibility to protect in order to prevent crises such as that in Syria, which you, Baroness Ashton, said appalled you? How do we identify new partners in line with our world view and how do we work with them, and how do we meet the challenges raised by the Northern and Southern Neighbourhood Policy? It is a difficult task, Baroness Ashton, to solve our external problems, and that is not your responsibility alone, as we will see tomorrow in the debate on the state of the Union. We must start by doing our work internally. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (ES)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, in the previous debate, Baroness Ashton said that you were appalled by the situation in Syria, and I think we have run out of words to describe it, as has been said in other debates. Indignation, frustration, impotence, and meanwhile, the bloodbath continues in Syria. We should look at events, too: Kofi Annan’s resignation in a plan that was doomed to failure from the very beginning. And statements, so many statements: a statement by the new Special Envoy, saying that this is an almost impossible mission, which makes me wonder why he accepted it; a statement by the minister of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, saying that new sanctions are to be imposed on Syria; statements by the Swedish minister, saying that he does not believe sanctions are going to have any impact; statements by the French minister, saying that we need to put more pressure on Syria. In short, a lot of words and not much action. As you rightly said, Baroness Ashton, the situation is continuing as it has done for months, but with even more deaths. The regime is sheltering behind the complicity of Russia and China in the United Nations Security Council, and the opposition is winning support across the regional sphere, hoping that sooner or later, there will be international intervention. In the meantime, Baroness Ashton, I believe the time has come for the EU and regional actors to make a decision. I would like to ask you to answer some specific questions. Do you agree with the statement made by the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, who said the time has come to do something if the Security Council does not make any progress? Do you believe it is viable to establish humanitarian corridors? Do you think it is possible to establish a no-fly zone? Do you believe it is desirable and advisable to arm, support and help the opposition? Baroness Ashton, more than 20 000 dead people are looking to us, and we have to turn our words into actions. You have done a very good job of providing humanitarian aid, and continue to do so, but our purpose is not to be an International Red Cross. We want to have political leverage, with other actors, in order to stop this carnage. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, despite the financial crisis, I do not think we should forget that the European integration project is based on values: peace, understanding, harmony, reconciliation and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are part of the genetic code of the European Union. Not only are they part of the genetic code of the European Union, but they are also laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Among the institutions, surely Parliament is the one that is most committed to defending rights and fundamental freedoms and has a total and permanent commitment to the cause of human rights, which must not just apply to one region, country or continent, but which must be of a global or universal nature. Parliament has therefore given a Vice-President the responsibility for monitoring human rights; it has a body, which is the Subcommittee on Human Rights, as part of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET); it has created a new working group on democracy and electoral observation and there is always a section in its order of business dedicated to resolutions to defend human rights. Obviously, Parliament has distinguished itself by awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, which, as you know, was founded by a person who left a legacy promoting peace, respect, tolerance and peoples living together peacefully. Madam President, in this context, I am delighted to present this report which, in the form of recommendations, discusses the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights, and I would like to thank members of my political group for the prior work they have done and also thank the other political groups for their work and support. An important aspect, Baroness Ashton, is the mandate of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights. The representative must work to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, international justice and humanitarian law; to promote the abolition of the death penalty; and in all areas aimed at defending the causes of human rights’ defenders, fighting torture and impunity, defending women’s rights, child protection and the rights of minors, peace and security and, of course, the rejection of all forms of discrimination. The EU Special Representative must work very directly with Parliament and other international bodies, and must work in a context of visibility, flexibility and coherence with the historical aspects that I mentioned at the start of my speech, Madam President. The representative must be a person of broad experience, proven ability, international prestige and, of course, sufficient professional experience in the field of human rights. Obviously, Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Parliament does not seek to hijack the decision-making process for appointing this person, as it is up to the High Representative to make the proposal to the Council. However, in this context, I would like to highlight the particular importance of this appointment and the desire that, based on the trust and the mandate represented by the resolution that Parliament is going to adopt, you make the right appointment. This person is going to have a huge profile in defending this cause which, as I said, Parliament sees as a total and permanent commitment to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank some of my fellow Members for the work they did in advance to prepare this report and, of course, all those who have spoken in this debate. I note with satisfaction, Baroness Ashton, your firm commitment to ensuring that the EU Special Representative has a link with and works permanently and continuously with Parliament. Beyond the terms of the mandate, on which we have spoken extensively during this debate, and which, in my opinion, should also be applied to the interpretation of the democratic clause that we have with some third countries, there remains the question of the personal profile of the candidate. I was personally very pleased by the speech made by Mr Mitchell regarding the profile that this person should have, which brings to mind the anecdote sometimes told about when, in fourth century Athens, after the age of Pericles, Aristotle was walking with his pupils of the Peripatetic School and one of them made an observation that displeased his teacher. When Aristotle answered, the pupil said to him, ‘that is not my observation, but that of your teacher Plato’. Aristotle’s response has been repeated numerous times on the European stage from the fourth century BC to the present day and our technological and Internet era: ‘Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is the truth’. I believe that the Special Representative must be an integral part of the institutional structure of the European Union, report to the High Representative, have a link to Parliament and the Member States, but that what must be more dear to him or her must be the cause of defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, so that human rights and fundamental freedoms, as Parliament wishes, can take hold in the 21st century across the world.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus on the case of Syria. We have run out of adjectives to describe the deterioration of the situation there and the growing number of victims, including executed women and children. The words that best describe the way the international community feels are indignation and, of course, a feeling of frustration and powerlessness. It is clear that Kofi Annan’s plan has failed spectacularly and that we will need to think about other options. Keeping a minute’s silence – as occurred recently at the United Nations – and applying economic sanctions are hardly ways to overcome this situation. The Secretary General of the United Nations has said quite clearly that the President of Syria has entirely lost his legitimacy and that we cannot become accustomed to massacres being a daily occurrence. This situation and this conflict are dragging on too long, in my view, with the complicity, in particular, of a permanent member of the Security Council and of the Iranian regime. Baroness Ashton, a moment ago in this House, we had an extensive debate on the European Union’s role in defending rights and fundamental freedoms in the EU. Above and beyond our presence in the various contact groups, which is entirely justified, the EU has an obligation to put forward initiatives to bring an end to this situation and prevent the President of Syria from continuing to buy more time and massacring the opposition. It is also clear that the Syrian National Council must cooperate, and we hope that its new president, elected in Istanbul the other day, can unite the internal and external opposition. However, given the failure of diplomatic measures, there are not many options left open: humanitarian intervention, which is currently not possible due to the vetoes by Russia and China in the Security Council; political agreements with President al-Assad, which are continuing to result in him buying more time and cruelly repressing the opposition; or other mechanisms that would ultimately result in a civil war being sparked, which is already practically the case. Experience in neighbouring countries has shown us that, in order to try to bring an end to this situation in the short term, we need to seek political solutions to transfer power in the medium term. In this context, this solution is very difficult without a military presence and international troops. These are my questions, Baroness Ashton: do you ultimately think it will be possible to provide a military presence in order to try to respond and stop the dreadful conflict currently taking place in Syria? Who would be responsible for supplying those troops? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s debate in the House and the resolution that will be adopted afterwards, we wanted to highlight the importance of this association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine for the country’s European prospects, and as we have been reminded in this debate, a key element of the agreement is the democracy clause on respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, and respect for the rules of the democratic game. It is clear that the trial, conviction and humanitarian situation of Yulia Tymoshenko and of others blatantly violate the spirit and letter of this democratic clause. Parliament therefore must show its solidarity with these people, request that their rights be fully respected, strongly condemn the use of force, as has been observed, and, of course, ensure that opposition leaders can stand in the next elections, many of whom are currently in jail, like Yulia Tymoshenko. For that reason, I agree with what the Commissioner, Mr Füle said, in the sense that the signing of the association agreement cannot occur under these circumstances, and therefore, Parliament should not go ahead and ratify it. Secondly, without questioning the hosting of the European Football Championships, which is being organised jointly with Poland, I believe, and I am addressing you, Commissioner, that the European Union should try to give a joint response, given that we are supposed to be trying to establish a common foreign and security policy, as such that the representatives of the European Union and the Member States can act in a homogenous, joint manner from a shared standpoint. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we are debating an agreement between the European Union and Peru and Colombia, and speaking of human rights, Mr President, I would like Parliament to condemn the assassination of 12 members of the Colombian armed forces yesterday at the hands of the FARC terrorist organisation, 150 metres from the Venezuelan border. And I think, Mr President, that Parliament should convey its condemnation, warmth and solidarity to Colombian society as a whole and the victims’ families during these difficult times. The Commission has made it abundantly clear, Mr President, that we should not emphasise an ongoing dynamic of demands that has not been imposed on other countries that have signed up to agreements of this type. I think we should place emphasis on the fact that this agreement is a clear and predictable framework to try to overcome a regime of unilateral concessions, which I want to remind my colleagues already exists, is in force, and is going to affect trade, investments and services. And in this context, I am greatly surprised that many Members in this House state that they have doubts about this agreement, but that they do not have doubts about the human rights situation in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras or Nicaragua, with which the European Union has reached the same type of agreement, or in Mexico, where we all know about the rates of violence. What is true, Mr President, is that this agreement is going to put Peru and Colombia on an equal footing with other countries that benefit from the same facilities, as is clearly the case with Chile, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, Israel and the CARICOM nations. I believe, Mr President, that the European Union, its 27 Member States, the Commission, Peru and Colombia have signed this agreement, and I believe that we are falling into the trap of a paternalism exercise if we tell our partner countries what is good for them or what is no longer good for them. I think they are mature enough to know that they want this agreement because the European Union is a useful partner. And I believe, Mr President, that instead of considering introducing discriminatory and additional measures, what we have to do is to find out why, after almost two and a half years, Commissioner, this agreement has not yet been ratified. I do not think this situation paints the European Union in a good light and that, on the contrary, we should swiftly ratify it. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Mr President, I think we should congratulate ourselves on having made the decision to hold a debate and adopt a resolution. However, bearing in mind that Baroness Ashton will not be present in Parliament tomorrow due to a commitment she has with NATO defence ministers, I believe it would be appropriate to alter the agenda so that we could hear her speak, because she intends to make a statement on that very issue. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Howitt concerns human rights, including political, social and economic rights. That is why I should particularly like to thank you, Baroness Ashton, for the statement you made on the situation that has arisen in the Repsol company before we began our debate on this report. You said a great deal in a short time. You mentioned a wrong decision; a threat to investments and the future of Argentina; the need to comply with the commitments that were made; the measures you took to include this issue on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council; the postponement of the meeting of the EU-Argentina Joint Cooperation Committee; as well as analysing possible measures. With regard to Mr Howitt’s report, Madam President, I believe it is a reasonable report in general terms, although clearly some matters still need to be addressed, such as the decision to send a fact-finding mission to Gaza – which is a request that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) obviously cannot accept, as the rapporteur is well aware – and Mr Howitt’s position on Colombia, which is quite simply delusional. That amendment was already rejected in the vote taken in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and, for us, at a time when we are waiting for the Multipart Trade Agreement between Peru, Colombia and the European Union to be ratified, it is unacceptable. Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to highlight a fundamental aspect of our human rights policy, one with which Parliament has an irrevocable and unquestionable commitment. I am referring to the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. Parliament will vote on this issue in a resolution, and we would like the selection procedure for this individual to be objective, Baroness Ashton, so that the person appointed can truly have the merit and capability to fulfil this important role to the high level it certainly deserves.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, a threefold game is currently being played out in Syria. Several things are being determined: the influence that Iran and Saudi Arabia will have; the role that Egypt is going to play in the context of the Arab Spring; and the vacuum created by the election campaign in the United States, which China and Russia would both like to fill. The apparent good news is the unanimous adoption of this resolution in the United Nations Security Council. The important thing here, Mr President, is that the adoption of this resolution should be consistent with the attitude of those countries as regards the situation that has arisen in Syria. The path of diplomacy is slow to produce results, and meanwhile, Mr al-Assad is gaining time in order to continue repressing the population. The truth, Baroness Ashton, is that although we need to support Mr Annan’s plan, we are sending out mixed signals to the international community. On the one hand, Mr al-Assad remains in power, gaining time – for he knows that the veto by China and Russia enables him to massacre his population with impunity – and, on the other hand, we are sending out a message to dissidents that there is no short-term solution. It is therefore important, Mr President, that we should take all these factors into consideration; the EU deserves recognition for the action it has taken on humanitarian aid, the mobilisation of funds with Ms Georgieva, which you just mentioned, and its continued support for the deployment of this mission. However, as a diplomat from my country pointed out – and rightly so, I believe – according to the basis of Mr Annan’s plan, the solution to the conflict unfortunately has to begin with Mr al-Assad, but it also has to end with his removal.

 On behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we want to declare that our vote on the resolution on the European integration process of Kosovo is based on the fact that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it was a normal independent state, recognised by the international community, and does not take into account that the status of this territory continues to be controversial. It has yet to be recognised by a majority of countries, five of which are Member States of the European Union, including Spain. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, in the interests of achieving the broadest consensus possible, we believe that this resolution should receive wide support from this House, and so we propose an oral amendment to Amendment 5, in agreement with Mr Swoboda, Mr Verhofstadt and the other political groups. In the English version, this oral amendment consists of adding the words ‘strengthening and implementation’ after the word ‘introduction’, and the replacement of the word ‘condemns’ by the word ‘deplores’.

 Mr President, Mr Søvndal, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate on Russia is of great concern to us and forces us to choose between what is desirable and what is possible. The resolution that Parliament will have to vote on tomorrow addresses the very specific set of circumstances that have followed the presidential elections. We are faced with an official Russia which still harks back to the era of the Soviet Union and which feels entitled to veto freedom within the United Nations Security Council. This is a Russia where the President and the Prime Minister shamelessly take turns to be in power. A Russia where elections are not held in compliance with international standards, and a Russia where opposition figures are detained, which takes us back to the recent and far from glorious past. However, Mr President, this is also a Russia which is a member of the Council of Europe and of the World Trade Organisation, which duly collaborates with the OECD and wishes to become one of its members, and a Russia where, as in the Arab Spring countries, there are men and women who are fighting for their freedom and dignity. Mr President, I think what is central to this resolution is to work for change and to open a space for dialogue and conversation with the opposition whose rights have been infringed and ignored. We should leave until later, until Mr Swoboda’s report, the issue of the institutional framework, the new association agreement between the European Union and Russia, two entities that need to come to an understanding. Mr President, I think that from the viewpoint of the European Union – I would like to appeal to the President-in-Office of the Council and to the Commission’s representative – that we should mobilise all our efforts and influence to make what is desirable become possible, so that fundamental freedoms and the rights of all will soon become a reality throughout Russia.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, surely the deterioration of the political situation in Belarus, the problem of the political prisoners and the crisis that has arisen in relation to the EU ambassadors, which was analysed by the Foreign Affairs Council last Saturday, require that Parliament hold a debate on this issue. Therefore, Mr President, we call for a statement by the High Representative or, if she cannot be present, by the President-in-Office and, of course, by the Commissioner for Neighbourhood Policy and for a debate to take place. Accordingly, Mr President, we ask that, on the basis of this statement, this matter be included in the agenda, together with a debate and a resolution. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are three independent and developing factors affecting the Syrian crisis. Firstly, a kind of cold war between Saudi Arabia and, currently, Iran, which is becoming apparent on several fronts, and specifically in Syria at the moment, then, what is clearly a domino effect from the so-called ‘Arab Spring’, and finally, a greater desire on the part of China and Russia and other players in the Middle East conflict to make their presence felt and to fill the vacuum left by the European Union and the United States. We have followed the High Representative’s actions with a great deal of interest: suspension of development aid, humanitarian help, a contingency plan, the tightening of sanctions at the next Council of Ministers on 27 February, and support to the Arab League initiative. A more effective and coordinated diplomatic response from the Member States of the European Union was lacking, however. Unfortunately, none of those decisions has led to a short-term reduction in the intolerable violence that is being suffered by the Syrian people, hence the frustration we all share. The French Foreign Minister expressed that view today during an appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, in relation to the failure of the initiative and the Russian and Chinese vetoes in the United Nations Security Council. An initiative from Qatar and Saudi Arabia is being debated in the General Assembly as we speak, with the specific aim of ratifying the agreement, even though we know that it does not have any binding effects. What can we do about this situation? Increase the pressure on Russia and China, certainly. Two very appropriate occasions for doing so have arisen recently: one was the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of China to the United States, where he was received with full honours, and, of course, the EU-China Summit that has just taken place. It is also clear that we have to strengthen our relationship with the Syrian dissidents, and we have to see how this humanitarian corridor they have requested can be established and developed. In addition, it is clear is that the questions the Foreign Ministers of the Arab League asked themselves the other day also apply to us. How long are we going to remain impassive towards the violence that the Syrian people are currently suffering? Also, what is our tolerance limit when deadline after deadline passes, initiatives come and go, and the regime continues butchering the Syrian people? It is my belief, Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Secretary-General of the European External Action Service, that this is the key issue to be considered in today’s debate.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to bring up the matter of the El Universo
 newspaper in Ecuador. The facts are well known. The President of the Republic of Ecuador has brought criminal proceedings against the journalist, the newspaper and its owners because of the opinion that was expressed. The proceedings have led to a three-year sentence, given by two courts, and a fine of USD 40 million, which presents a serious threat to the newspaper’s very survival. A number of organisations have made reference to this matter, such as Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, and other international media and organisations working in the field of human rights. My question, Baroness Ashton, is very simple: are you aware of these facts? What is your opinion on the matter? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (ES) 
Mr President, as you are aware, Baroness Ashton, Ecuador is linked to the EU by a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement, which is based on the democratic clause and respect for fundamental rights, one of which is the right to freedom of expression. As you rightly said, on 10 February the Supreme Court will give its verdict on the appeal for this case; President Correa has said that he would be prepared to withdraw the court action if he is issued an apology. In addition to the concern you have expressed for freedom of expression in Ecuador, what would you be prepared to do in order to find a balanced, fair solution that respects the principle of freedom of expression?

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, on 23 January the Council took a difficult but consistent decision, and for that I congratulate Baroness Ashton. This Parliament will support the Council conclusions in the resolution we will vote on tomorrow. As you have just explained, it was difficult because it required sacrifices by several Member States, and it was consistent because it is in keeping with the positions we have defended so far. Both the President of France and the Prime Ministers of France and the United Kingdom have said that they will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. However, as well as being consistent, these measures need to be effective in order to promote the path of dialogue, bring Iran back to the negotiating table, ensure its full cooperation with the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and also, Baroness Ashton, to silence the drums of war that can be heard. Israel has said that all options are being considered, and one Republican candidate in the United States has said that swift action should be taken. Furthermore, some Iranian ministers have said that these sanctions will be ineffective, because the EU needs Iranian crude oil more that Iran needs the EU’s resources. What is more, the threat to close the Strait of Hormuz and the risk of escalating tension in the region could have serious repercussions for oil prices and further complicate the difficult economic situation we are going through. That is why, Baroness Ashton, I would like to say to you that, beyond the internal dimension and the consistency that were shown in the Council decisions of 23 January, it is also important to take action with our allies at this stage as regards our external scope and influence. You just told us that you visited India; the stance taken by India, Japan and other countries is vital to ensure that the measures adopted can have the effect that many of us are hoping for.

 Mr President, High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as Baroness Ashton has said, the situation in Syria is getting worse by the day, with an extremely high toll in terms of human life. You mentioned the figures released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: more than 4 000 people, of whom 1 000 are members of the security forces, and this augurs a bloody civil war in the country. Statements of condemnation have come from all sides – the United States, the European Council, the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union. However, Baroness Ashton, I believe that the time has come to move from words to action, because condemnation alone will not bring a halt to this situation. On the economic side, what can we do? You got it right, Baroness Ashton: implement the economic sanctions we have introduced, stop Syrian oil imports to the European Union and support the decisions of the Arab League and Turkey. On the political front, we should firstly support the deployment of ground forces requested by the Arab League. Secondly, we should strengthen relations with the Syrian National Council. I would also like to ask your opinion, Baroness Ashton, on the French initiative to create a humanitarian corridor protected by international troops. Lastly, we should obtain a more solid resolution from the United Nations, overcoming the reticence of some permanent members of the Security Council, such as China and Russia, whose position is absolutely unjustifiable, continuing in the vein of Resolutions 1970 and 1973, which, in the case of Libya, made it possible to put an end to a government’s criminal violence against its own people. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the next EU-US summit will be determined by the economic and financial crisis. I believe that both parties should adopt a modest approach and apply that Chinese proverb that, before launching ourselves into the task of putting the world to rights, we should first take a look at our own house. This means weighing up the global influence of each party and highlighting the role and the economic, commercial, financial and industrial weight of the European Union. Beyond the economic and financial problems, I believe that it is important to consider the lessons learned in Libya, after Operation Unified Protector, where the European Union was criticised. We should also consider the situation in Syria, after today’s meeting of the Arab League and try to move forward the search for a resolution in the Security Council of the United Nations. Then there is the peace process in the Middle East, which the Commissioner referred to, and the Palestinian question, in which the European Union gave a pitiful performance at the vote in UNESCO. We should also ask for greater consistency between words and deeds after the speech of President Obama in the United States. It is clear, Madam President, that the European Union and the United States are two partners who have a shared vision of the world, and although this is not always identical, they have a duty to understand and respect each other. Therefore it must be accepted that in today’s globalised world, in the face of challenges and threats that affect us all equally – whether it is the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime, the economic and financial crisis or unemployment, protecting the environment and natural resources or emigration – we must search for responses to all of these equally. It must also be accepted that unilateralism, even for the most prosperous and the most powerful, is an impossible dream. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, a balanced approach to the problem should be based on three premises: the State of Israel’s legitimate desire for security, the frustration of the Palestinian people and the blockage in the peace process. All of this, Baroness Ashton, comes at a time when international attention is focused on the Arab Spring, at a time when the United States is hampered by its electoral commitments, at a time when the government of Israel is divided and has almost no room for manoeuvre and when Palestinian radicals are increasingly showing their pleasure with the lack of results. Given this situation, Baroness Ashton, the question is very simple: what can we do as the European Union? In this context, I would like to tell you that Parliament, which has criticised you so many times – and I have been the first to do so – must acknowledge your efforts to seek solutions in Cairo, Ramallah, Jerusalem, New York and Washington, and your calls for the European Union to speak with one voice. In politics, Madam President, whatever is impossible is wrong. In the face of the United States’ announced veto in the Security Council, the President of France, as in the Georgia crisis in 2008 and this year in Libya, has proposed a compromise solution, which is the Vatican solution. Baroness Ashton, what view should we take of this initiative? Do you think it can be supported by the Member States? What can the European Union do to make the Quartet’s solution acceptable to the Palestinians? Madam President, if the European Union wants to be relevant and not decline in significance on the international stage, it must take a step forwards. It must move in the right direction and rouse itself from its lethargy. I am not saying this because of you, Baroness Ashton. You have done a lot and you have done it well, but you must propose solutions that are concrete, tangible, with defined costs and a precise timetable. You need to do this – and this is the hard part – without impinging on or harming the dignity of either side, while also recognising the inalienable rights that will enable one side to live in peace and security and the others to form their own state.

 Madam President, Commissioner, if we consider that a 42-year dictatorship has been brought to an end within a period of six months, in theory that could sound like a relatively short time frame. However, if we take this into account and consider it in the context of the human lives lost, the suffering caused and the setback this will bring for generations to come, then I think our assessment will be significantly different. In any event, everything remains to be done now that Muammar Gaddafi’s regime has fallen: provide humanitarian aid; guarantee security; establish order and control along the borders; bring about economic reconstruction, as well as a process of transition under extremely difficult circumstances; and ensure that there is no impunity for crimes committed. The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Dowgielewicz, has just said – and I agree with his assessment – that, within the framework of both NATO and the European Union, this despicable regime has been done away with thanks, in particular, to the action taken by specific Member States – such as France and the United Kingdom – and thanks to the determination and courage shown by the Libyan people. We should also acknowledge that the European Union, after some early wavering and remaining within the scope of its powers, acted swiftly and properly. It is true, as well, that Parliament was the first authority to call for the recognition of the National Transitional Council (NTC), thanks – if truth be told – to an invitation by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. It should also be noted that France was the first country to recognise the NTC. We have EUR 154 million in humanitarian aid, and a newly opened EU Office in Benghazi and Tripoli, which should quickly be upgraded to delegation status and for which a head of delegation with auctoritas
 should be appointed as soon as possible in order to tackle the important task of coordinating EU action with the Member States, and also with the Office that the Secretary General of the United Nations requested from the United Nations Security Council. Madam President, Mr Dowgielewicz, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, just three days ago in this Parliament we, like many others around the globe, commemorated the tenth anniversary of the vicious terrorist attack on the Twin Towers. The EU must make the Arab Spring one of its absolute priorities for two reasons: firstly, in order to live up to that cry for freedom and dignity that is spreading through North Africa and the Arab nations; and secondly, to prevent radical Islamic fundamentalism from taking root in the societies around us and interrupting the process of transition that is under way in those countries and, above all, to prevent freedom from being threatened once again by barbarity and fanaticism. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Secretary-General, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the interest we have been taking in the Arab Spring, as shown by the debate we have just had on Libya and Syria, should not distract our attention away from the situation in the Middle East and, in particular, from the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. This issue can be approached from an outside perspective – any implications that the outcome of the General Assembly might have on the peace process, and any change to the status quo, count a great deal – and from the perspective of the internal dimension of the EU. With regard to the external perspective, the peace process is in deadlock, as Mr Dowgielewicz has just told us. We are seeing increased tension in the region – the most tangible evidence of that was the attack on the Israeli embassy in Egypt – and also very particular circumstances for the United States government. President Obama is going to have difficulty meeting the proposals he set out in his inaugural speech in Cairo, because of the situation within the United States and also as a result of the electoral process he will soon have to face. Mr President, in politics anything that is not possible is false; without wishing to prejudge the substance of the resolution that is going to be adopted, I believe that we should start getting ready to adopt a draft resolution that improves the status of Palestine within the United Nations. This leads me on to the internal dimension of this issue: it is vital that the EU can express itself in a united voice on this sensitive point. Our past experiences in the United Nations have not been glorious. To be sure, we have shifted position in light of the new mechanisms established by the Treaty of Lisbon, and I believe that we need to focus all our efforts on three objectives: the peace process must move forward, and the status quo of a lack of negotiations must end; the chances to move forward on this issue must not be compromised or endangered; and the dignity of both parties in this conflict must be respected. Mr President, on this point I feel that the EU’s greatest strength is its union, and its greatest weakness is its division. I would therefore ask Mr Dowgielewicz – I realise, of course, that the Commissioner and Baroness Ashton are doing all they can on the matter – to ensure that the European Union faces this sensitive issue without showing its customary division, and appears united by making a positive, active contribution to the progress that needs to be made in this conflict.

Mr President, they say that when the celebrated thinker, Ortega y Gasset, was asked what distance one needed to be from events in order to write history, he said, far enough not to be able to see the profile of Cleopatra’s nose. Lady Ashton, I bring this anecdote up not because Egypt is a country affected by the Arab Spring but rather because in the EU, we are experiencing an historic dilemma involving a lack of confidence in our project, debt crisis, the calling into question of the basic achievements that are most valued by our citizens, such as the Schengen area, and doubts over the ability of NATO. However, over the last two and a half years, we have experienced tangible progress in the form of your own duties as Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the birth of the European External Action Service and the Joint Communication on a renewed European Neighbourhood Policy. You said yesterday that our neighbours will always be there and I share that view. The question is about us, whether we will rise to the occasion, whether we will live up to the expectations of our citizens, who regard foreign policy as a barometer for the state of the EU, whether we will be able to accompany these transition processes effectively in the countries that are the subject of the resolution that we will adopt tomorrow. Lady Ashton, we are clearly backing that. We believe and hope that you will succeed in your work, but in order to do so, you must act with the highest profile. Not a physical profile, like in Ortega’s response, but rather a political profile, with particular emphasis on finding the greatest common denominator and not the lowest common multiple.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the central factor in this overly broad debate should be the situation in North Africa and the Near East. We must approach this debate without extolling virtues – Baroness Ashton has rightly highlighted some positive elements; I would emphasise the good or, rather, the better provision of information between Parliament and the European External Action Service – yet also without concealing defects, and a voice as sensible as that of Giorgio Napolitano, our former fellow Member and President of the Italian Republic, has reminded us of this recently. Among the negative aspects, and despite the efforts of Baroness Ashton, is the different yardsticks against which the cases of Libya and Syria are measured in the United Nations Security Council and also in the Council of Ministers of the European Union. Also among the negative aspects, Baroness Ashton, is the situation of Camp Ashraf: you are aware of the positive, constructive and moderating role that my group is playing in the development of foreign policy, and believe me when I say that the importance and sensitivity of the Iranian dossier has not escaped me. However, in spite of the warnings about the humanitarian aspect made to your services, to your collaborators, to your cabinet and to your Director-General, and despite the fact that I submitted a draft statement to you myself, you did not speak out until there had been 32 deaths and more than 300 wounded. You can draw your own conclusions. You yourself said this morning that we have to act and we have to be coherent, particularly in relation to the defence of human rights; especially by taking risks, Baroness Ashton, when there are lives in danger. My question to you is this: with regard to the Cuban dissident, Juan Wilfredo Soto García, who was arrested, beaten and finally killed, are you willing to call for an investigation to shed light on these tragic events? If this investigation shows that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the beating received and his death, are you willing to condemn them? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Mr President, I entirely agree with what you have just said. Mr Németh, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that we have been continuously following the flow of information provided by the High Representative, Mrs Ashton, on the developments in these countries and I think we should recognise the efforts she is making on behalf of the European Union in support of the democratic aspirations in Bahrain, Yemen and Syria. Tomorrow, Parliament will adopt a resolution supported by all the political groups in this regard. However I would like to put forward a couple of questions, Mr President, and would ask Mr Németh to pass them on to Mrs Ashton. First of all, in some bodies of the Union and, of course, in this Parliament, there is the feeling that we are taking a step back in the development of the Common Security and Defence Policy, and that we are being taken back to the times of political cooperation. Obviously, that is not why we established the Treaty of Lisbon. Secondly, a contradiction has arisen, related to the growing need for a European presence in those countries, with no knowledge of what will be the end result of these transitional processes. It is clear that we have to be present, and it is also clear that the slogan used in Mrs Ashton’s communication is very wise: ‘more for more’ However, the question I wish to ask – and I shall conclude now, Mr President – is whether the EU Member States are willing to increase resources to meet the growing needs that are emerging in those countries. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Madam President, the crisis in North Africa is putting the mechanisms established in the Treaty of Lisbon to the test. Yesterday, in the High Representative’s appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we stressed the positive aspects of European Union action: Baroness Ashton’s communication that distinguishes between the short, medium and long terms; rapid application of Resolution 1970 of the United Nations Security Council; the ability to negotiate with the Arab League; and the European Council meeting. However, it is only fair to say here today that there are still certain questions being asked by European public opinion and, therefore, by our citizens. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt is absolutely right. How is it possible that, in this day and age, the four Member States that form part of the United Nations Security Council do not vote in the same way but rather do so differently? How is it possible, in this day and age, that we should be discussing whether the United Nations resolution is applied by the European Union, by NATO or by the international coalition, when we are talking about the same resources coming from the same taxpayers; about the same ships and their use in the same theatre of operations? It is clear that we still have much to improve as regards our capacity for coordination, and much to improve too in the decision-making process. There is a famous line from a film, which says that ‘we will always have Paris’. Someone said during this debate that the European Union’s response has been hasty. If it had not been for France’s courage, determination and consistency – and that is how it must be put – in recognising the rebels, in sending the Minister of Foreign and European Affairs to the Security Council, in calling the Elysée summit and in applying the resolution, Lady Ashton, Colonel Gaddafi’s troops would already have entered Benghazi.

 Mr President, the European Union finds itself torn between two frustrations in the Libyan crisis, between what is desirable – the earliest possible disappearance of a criminal regime that is determined to die killing – and what is achievable. If we are honest, Mr President, we must acknowledge that the European Union, despite all its efforts, has not lived up to public expectations. This is not a criticism, Baroness Ashton, but rather a question of powers. We have acted promptly and we have acted well, within the scope of our powers, with the European Union fully endorsing Resolution 1970 of the United Nations Security Council. However, we are not a military union. We are aspiring to be a political union, and we are still only an embryonic player on the international stage. This is why, Mr President, whilst we are holding this debate, whilst the United Nations Human Rights Council is meeting today, and whilst the Council of Ministers for Defence, the Foreign Affairs Council and the European Council are meeting tomorrow, people are still dying in Libya. It is against this backdrop that we must think about what it is that we can do. Can we stand aside whilst innocent civilians are massacred? Can we remain impassive to the ‘Somalisation’ of Libya, whilst the United Nations Security Council reaches another slow motion decision? The European Union must send a message that is loud and clear, and has a single message: ‘the Gaddafi regime must end right now’. This message must be accompanied by a set of measures that ratchet up the pressure. First and foremost, Mr President, the no-fly zone, the neutralising of Mr Gaddafi’s communications – and I believe we should congratulate the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe for bringing representatives of the Libyan opposition to the European Parliament – and, of course, international coordination, most particularly with the African Union and also with the Arab League. This, Mr President, is what the public is expecting of us, and you will have the full support of our political group to achieve it, Baroness Ashton. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, in the context of our debate on the current human rights situation, and in view of the last report discussed, I would like to address the following question to Lady Ashton. In view of the current situation in some North African countries and within the region, do you feel that this is the right time to be opening a European Union delegation in Iran? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 – (ES)
 Mr President, I did not really understand Lady Ashton’s answer. I am not sure whether she gave me an answer, whether she said that she would respond at a later date to my question on whether it is the right time to be opening a European Union delegation in Iran given the current human rights concerns, or indeed whether there was no answer. As I did not understand the answer, I would like to repeat my question. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, you quite rightly said, Baroness Ashton, that the situation in the southern Mediterranean is diverting attention from the conflict in the Middle East and the peace process, which has already been drawn out over almost 30 years and appears to have come to a standstill. As your visit has demonstrated, current events and the general situation in the region have had an impact on the process. In the light of that visit, I would like to ask your views on a number of issues. This morning, we discussed the difficulties that the United Nations Security Council is having in obtaining a further resolution to impose a no-fly zone in Libya. To what extent do you feel that the peace process and the credibility of a key player have been affected by its recent veto of the proposed resolution condemning the settlements in the Palestinian territories? In your opinion, how does the lack of a Security Council decision affect perceptions of the Obama administration’s commitment to pursuing this process? Secondly, how do you view the decision taken by the Palestinian National Authority to hold presidential and legislative elections before September and Hamas’s decision not to take part in these elections? Lastly, Baroness Ashton, I would like to hear what you think of the resignation of the Palestinian chief negotiator following the publication of documents by WikiLeaks, the reshuffle within the Palestinian National Authority and the repercussions that the leaked documents have had on the Palestine side, on the Israeli Government, or on both parties as a whole.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mubarak has disappeared from the scene and everyone seems to have breathed a sigh of relief. Firstly, the Egyptian people, who have seen their legitimate expectations of greater dignity and democracy satisfied, and, secondly, the international community that, not without a certain cynicism, has gone from being the ally of yesterday to the nuisance of today and, perhaps, to the accused of the future. However, Madam President, I do not believe that we should deceive ourselves. The departure of Mr Mubarak and Mr Ben Alí are necessary conditions, but not sufficient, to guarantee the process of democratic transition, over which there still hang many uncertainties. The most important thing is: to consolidate democracy. Madam President, it is also evident that, although democratic freedoms and human rights can be initiated by sixteen days of protest and public spiritedness, and be proclaimed by law from morning to night, economic and social progress cannot, unfortunately, be marshalled in the same manner. We have seen this in the heavy economic losses that both Egypt and Tunisia have been suffering in recent days. Returning to the Commissioner’s speech, I would like to say that, after the initial hesitations and some problems with the EU’s image, it appears that things are back on track. Baroness Ashton is in the region and what Mr Füle proposes makes a lot of sense. Firstly, to firmly and wholeheartedly support the process of democratic transition and the political reforms in those countries.Secondly, to carry out a critical review of the European neighbourhood policy in a way that strengthens the democratic clause. We have heard today, in the Enlarged Bureau, from the Polish Foreign Minister, the next President-in-Office of the Council, and his initiative to establish a Polish foundation on the subject of democracy and human rights. This could also be extended to the entire EU. Madam President, the EU has mobilised large amounts of resources in its Euro-Mediterranean policy with poor results. The EU’s image has suffered in this conflict, even more than that of other international players. However, the EU’s appeal remains intact. I would like to say, Madam President, that this is a good opportunity to underline that the EU understands, once and for all, that today history is being made in the present and in these historic times we are living through we have to act as a global player and perform the necessary duties or we will have to resign ourselves, Madam President, to not playing on the international stage in the role we want to maintain and we will have to restrict ourselves, as was the case until now, to picking up the bill for major global problems. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, whatever the result or outcome of the situation in Egypt, I believe that we are safe in saying that there will be a before and after the events that have taken place in Tunisia. It is my opinion that we should not be looking for culprits in this House as this crisis has caught the European Union on the wrong foot, however I feel that we ought to draw some conclusions on the matter. Firstly, the European Union needs to be more visible, it needs to speak with a unified voice and to avoid any cacophony; it is for this reason that we have created the European External Action Service and the figure of the High Representative. Secondly, we need to draw on the lessons offered to us by complacent policies with the enemies of freedom, from Belarus to Cuba and with the Mediterranean countries in between. We need to ask ourselves if there really is more stability, more prosperity and more democracy as the Barcelona Process intended. Thirdly, Mr President, I feel that we need to distinguish between what the European Union needs to do in the medium term and what it needs to do in the short term. In the short term – I think that Baroness Ashton has drawn up a road map – the European Union needs to offer resolute support to these transition processes so as not to frustrate these friendly countries’ hopes for freedom. It is also our duty, Mr President, to warn them of the risks involved in these processes, so they are not hijacked by the enemies of free societies. In the medium term, Mr President, it is important that the European Union reflects deeply on a strategic approach to reforming our neighbourhood policy as we also requested of Mr Füle yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. All of this must be done, Mr President, whilst bearing in mind that often it is more difficult to maintain the balance of freedom than to shake off the yoke of tyranny. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

Mr President, as stated in the text of the oral question that we have tabled, in the last three years, we have seen an escalation of the situation detrimentally affecting European Union interests and citizens in the southern Sahara, which has become a haven for the Islamic branch of al-Qaeda, with a whole string of murders, kidnappings, extortion, blackmail, drug trafficking and people trafficking, the victims of which have been German, Italian, Spanish and, most recently, French citizens. We therefore want to express our solidarity with our French fellow Members, and say, Baroness Ashton, that this situation demands a firm, unflinching response from the European Union, as President Sarkozy has demanded. In this context, this response needs to be made in the political, economic and development spheres, and Mr Danjean reminded us of the huge resources in the European Development Fund. Baroness Ashton, I would like you to give your assessment of the G8 anti-terrorism summit in October – when you received the Council mandate – in Mali, which Algeria did not attend. You said that the response needs to be a regional one. I think it is a bad sign that two of the parties in this conflict – such as Morocco and Algeria – are not cooperating with each other, on top of the unstable situation in Tunisia. Finally, Baroness Ashton, I would like you to give your assessment of the anti-terrorist centre created by Algeria 2 000 km south of Algiers, in which Mali, Mauritania and Niger are participating, and to tell me if you share the interpretation that the aim of this anti-terrorist centre is to prevent the European Union and the United States from being present in order to guarantee security in the area.

Mr President, the recent events in Tunisia should encourage us to reflect with a sense of responsibility on at least two issues. Firstly, on whether policies to support the status quo 
in countries that lack democratic freedoms really contribute to stability, in this case, in our immediate vicinity. Secondly, Mr President, we should reflect on whether the disappearance of Mr Ben Ali from the political scene is sufficient to guarantee that a real democratic transition will be brought about. In my view, Mr President, the answer to both these questions is no. Therefore, Mr Füle, there needs to be a thorough reflection around why the Neighbourhood Policy, in the spirit of the Barcelona Process, has not had the intended democratising effects, and how we could or should make adjustments to it. Secondly, experience has shown us in many cases that, when there is a power vacuum, the most radicalised and extremist parties replace the process, hijack it and want to ruin it. Mr President, if it is simply to defend freedom, extremism is not a vice; if it is only to defend justice, moderation is not a virtue. This ethical imperative means that the European Union must mobilise all its efforts to help ensure that this process is not derailed. I welcome what Mr Füle said about providing electoral assistance to Tunisia, but I think that it is even more important to go a step further and support Tunisia through a European Union electoral observation mission. It is not only because of this ethical imperative that is etched in the genetic code of the European Union that we should do this, Mr President, but also in our own interests: because there is no point travelling first class if there is a passenger in economy with a bomb in his suitcase.

Madam President, the new strategic concept of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), which emerged in Lisbon, was established in order to seek to respond and adapt, firstly to a new context, in other words the disappearance of the system of blockades and the end of the Cold War. Secondly, it was established in order to adapt to the new configuration of threats, and particularly to globalisation and the fact that our armies do not have apparent enemies and our enemies do not have armies. Based on this new strategic concept, while taking into consideration Article 5 of the Treaty of Washington regarding mutual assistance, there are three aspects that I am interested in. Firstly, how to shape this strategic alliance with Europe: Baroness Ashton, I would like to ask you whether you think that Turkey should participate as much as possible in the actions and the development of the common foreign and security policy. Secondly, regarding the ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by the United States Congress, do you think that this new strategic concept will be affected if it is not ratified? Finally, what are your thoughts on the subject of the anti-missile shield? Do you think that this notion in any way compromises the goal of reducing nuclear arsenals? It seems that there are opposing views on this among the Member States. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Madam President, they say that the philosopher Aristotle was walking around his famous Peripatetic School with his students when one of them made a comment that upset his master. By way of apology, he said, ‘that was not my comment, it was made by your master Plato’. Then Aristotle stopped and pronounced a sentence that has been repeated numerous times on the European stage from the fourth century BC to the present day. He said, ‘Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is the truth’. Madam President, Morocco is a positive and active partner of the European Union, and it is also a strategic and fundamental ally in containing radical Islamic fundamentalism. However, as President Sarkozy said when he spoke here, Parliament is the democratic heartbeat of the European Union, and has an irrevocable and undeniable commitment to the cause of human rights. Therefore, if these rights are not acknowledged, it cannot stand aside and look the other way. It must speak out loud and clear about the principles that drive us. Madam President, the European Union has been, is and will be a loyal partner of Morocco, but that partnership is based on principles and values, and we have to proclaim those principles and values. I will conclude now, Madam President, by saying that truly, moderation in character or temperament is always a virtue, but moderation in the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially freedom of expression, is always a vice, always a weakness and always cowardly, and as representatives of the people of the European Union we cannot allow ourselves to act in that way.

Relations between the European Union and the United States are, as has already been said, based on principles, ideas, a shared history and a shared passion for freedom. These values could, however, end up being diluted in rhetoric and languishing if we do not move from words to actions. One of the most reliable pieces of work that has been done in this House on the state of transatlantic relations since the presidential elections is the report by my colleague, Mr Millán Mon. The report is included in the current joint motion for a resolution that we will vote on tomorrow, and contains a series of specific initiatives that are still perfectly valid for establishing a genuine partnership, on which we need to get to work, Commissioner. Here, there has been talk of the importance of economic and trade relations, and 15 EU Member States alone invest more in Texas than the 50 US States invest in Japan. We need to give new impetus to the summit mechanisms, create a Euro-American Assembly and, most importantly, create a coordination and consultation mechanism for global issues and the most crucial areas of the world – the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan – and relations with the emerging powers. Mr President, during President Obama’s recent tour of the Middle East, we heard him say that they saw their most important partnership as being that between the United States and India. This reminded me of one of the fundamental aspects of Mr Millán Mon’s report, in which he recalled President Obama saying in Berlin that Europe was the most important strategic ally of the United States. The upcoming EU-US summit will be a wonderful opportunity to clarify this point and to clearly define what the strategic partnership really is. We could start by asking the United States to support the European Union in its demands to have an institutional presence, for example, in the United Nations General Assembly, based on the new approaches introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon.

Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks for the work done by the general rapporteur on the budget. Although, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we have exercised moderation and we are aware that the appropriations under heading 4 are increasing substantially above the average, we consider them to be insufficient for guaranteeing a consistent, visible and effective foreign policy that is in line with the ambitions introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. We are also surprised that the Council is expressing surprise at some of the tactical cuts being proposed by Parliament, given the significance of the cuts, both in terms of compromise appropriations and in terms of payment appropriations, which the Council itself has introduced. I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets, represented here by its Chair, for putting the appropriations for the new positions in the European External Action Service in reserve. Naturally, Mr President, this does not mean that we should not have a positive and constructive attitude, but obviously, in the conciliation process, Parliament has to be firm, very firm, in demanding its priorities, with the objective and aim of having the capacity to produce a budget for 2011, just as the President-in-Office of the Council has just said.

 Madam President, today’s debate does indeed raise the question of how to build a strategic partnership with China based on its economic potential and on our value system, particularly with respect to human rights, which have to be of a universal nature. Garton Ash, a brilliant British analyst, said that relations with China pose four problems, all of which begin with the letter ‘t’: trade, Taiwan, Tibet – and here, I would like to remind the House of the suspension of the EU-China summit in 2008 – and lastly, Tiananmen, in reference to the human rights issue. What is obvious, as Mr Kasoulides has said, is that none of the challenges facing the world at present, such as globalisation, the digital economy, reform of the financial system, the security issue, the fight against nuclear proliferation – just look at the case of Iran – environmental and natural resource conservation or energy supply security, can be resolved without the cooperation of China. The United States has managed to establish a structured relationship with China, though not without its problems. President Bush presented the Dalai Lama with the Congressional Gold Medal; nonetheless, relations between both countries are still functional. Commissioner, bearing in mind the importance of China on the world scene, in the United Nations Security Council, in the G20 and in the BRIC countries, will we, as the European Union, be capable of building and consolidating this relationship? More importantly, Madam President, will we, from the European Union, be able to smooth out the path to freedom given that rather unique system that is Chinese state capitalism? I believe, Madam President, that this is the most important question, and I would ask you, Commissioner, to defend our value system at the forthcoming summit, while also displaying a certain pragmatism.

Mr President, we are all pleased about the freeing of political prisoners in Cuba. However, on the subject of congratulations, I have not heard any offered to the Catholic Church and, in particular, to Parliament for the role it played, which has been key in the determined defence of all of those fighting for their freedom and dignity in Cuba. With regard to the subject of Mercosur, there are several clarifications that need to be made. As Commissioner De Gucht has explained, the Commission put forward some negotiation directives for the purposes of concluding an association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which were adopted by the Council and by Parliament. Negotiations have been deadlocked for six years, and it is clear that they have been reopened within the framework of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, with the support also of Parliament. The objective, at this point in time, is to reach a balanced agreement that shows overall consideration for the interests of all sectors within the European Union. I do not understand why certain sectors or interest groups should come out of this negotiation at a disadvantage. It has not been like this for 10 years, and there is no reason why it should be like this in the future. It will depend on the firmness of our negotiators. In any case, if this situation were to come about, it is clear that the Commission would need to come up with compensatory measures for the sectors affected. This is what has been done with third countries, with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and with the most recent agreements with the Andean Community. The main reason that this has been done with these countries is the need to defend European Union producers, of bananas in this case.

On behalf of the Spanish delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we would like to state that the reasoning behind our vote on the resolution on the process relating to the European integration of Kosovo is that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it were an independent state in an entirely normal situation, without taking into account the fact that the status of this territory continues to be very controversial within the international community – an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice is also pending – and Kosovo has not been recognised by five Member States of the European Union, including Spain.

 Mr President, the consultation procedure concludes with today’s declaration by the High Representative and tomorrow’s vote. It is therefore now time to thank all those whose work has made the European External Action Service (EEAS) possible, especially the European Parliament’s rapporteurs, to implement it faithfully and to ensure that it is able to come into operation as soon as possible, without losing sight of the fact that it is not an end in itself, but an instrument for providing the European Union with a foreign policy that is coherent, visible and effective. I am convinced that the guarantees that Baroness Ashton gave in her declaration are satisfactory from the point of view of political responsibility, and are in line with the prerogatives that the treaty assigns to Parliament as part of the information, consultation and partnership process. You may be assured, Baroness Ashton, that this House will be a loyal partner in the development of foreign and common security policy, as we have shown in the meetings that we have held with the new heads of delegation from Washington and Afghanistan., However, Baroness Ashton, we have a right to expect that the new service will be more effective and better than the existing one. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to wish you luck in putting the EEAS into practice, and say to you that, as the evangelical instruction has it, ‘by your works shall you be known’.

Mr President, irrespective of the contradictory versions of events – humanitarian flotilla or provocation strategy – Parliament must condemn the use of violence and must condemn the loss of human life, as it is irreparable. There are causes behind these events, and they have had consequences. Apart from the most distressing consequence which, as I said, is the loss of human life, the consequences include the derailment of the peace process; the distancing between Israel, the European Union and the United States; the separation in relations with moderate Arab countries; and increased tension in the region, with the Iranian nuclear spectre hovering over the whole area. I also think, Mr President, that the breakdown in relations with Turkey is an important factor. Baroness Ashton said something that I entirely agree with. Restoring dignity and hope to the Palestinian people will benefit the cause of peace in the region, security in Israel and, above all, the cause of the moderates and the unity of the Palestinian cause. It is certain – and we should not lose sight of this – that the lifting of the embargo is just one step. It is an important step, but it is just one step along the road towards peace. We are aware of the elements: the recognition of a viable Palestinian state; security for Israel’s borders; the resolution of the problem of East Jerusalem; the problem of the settlements, which needs to be brought to an end; and – I am concluding, Mr President – other issues. There are two issues involved in resolving this matter. One is international support and the other is political will. I am not sure, High Representative, that there is currently a sufficient mobilisation of political will. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

In view of the fact that some of the expressions included in paragraph 34, introduced by the opinion of the Committee on Development, are so ambiguous that they could be interpreted as being somewhat complacent regarding something as repulsive as abortion, the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has asked the group for a separate vote on that paragraph, in order to make it crystal clear that it is opposed to any initiative aimed at infringing the inalienable rights of the most vulnerable. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, High Representative, I would like to say that the report, as adopted by the committee, on the one hand, acknowledges the efforts made by the Spanish Presidency of the European Union – which I do not see in this Chamber, which surprises me given that we are talking about a Latin American matter – and, on the other hand, welcomes the Commission communication entitled ‘The European Union and Latin America: Global Players in Partnership’. I think it is difficult to find two regions that have more in common in terms of values and interests than Europe and Latin America. The figures, Madam President, are very well known: together, they have more than a billion citizens, account for more than 25% of global gross domestic product and, along with the Caribbean countries, include almost one third of the countries that make up the United Nations. It is also well known, although the figures show a slight decline, that the European Union is the main donor of development aid, the main investor in the region and the second largest trading partner in Latin America, and the largest in Mercosur and Chile. However, more importantly than the figures, we consider Latin America to be more than a market for Europe, and we therefore share a whole series of principles and values, which are pluralist and representative democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression, the constitutional state, the rule of law, respect for due process and the rejection of all forms of dictatorship and authoritarian rule. This summit, Mrs Ashton, comes at a very remarkable time in the calendar for the European Union and Latin America. It is a remarkable time for the European Union, because having gone through the reform process, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are a little engrossed in overcoming and contemplating our own problems, with the economic and monetary crisis. We have seen that, for the first time, the International Monetary Fund is not having to rescue a Latin American country, but a European Member State that is part of the Monetary Union. When we look at the European Union’s growth rates for last year, we see that, on average, we had a negative growth of 5%, while Latin America had a negative growth of 1.8%. When we look at the forecasts for growth for next year, we see that the European Union is expected to have an average growth of 0.7%, and Latin America of 5%. This means that the next summit is not going to be a North-South summit, like the previous summits, but a summit between equals. In that respect, I think that we should look back, if only briefly, and feel satisfied at what has been achieved in the last few years. It is clear, however, that a great deal still remains to be done. In that respect, Mrs Ashton, between 2000 and 2010, the European Union concluded association agreements with Mexico and Chile, but the United States concluded agreements with the whole of Central America, with Colombia and Peru, and also with various Mercosur countries. We therefore need to make up for lost time quickly, and in some way seek strategic partnerships with Mexico and Chile, apply the future developments clause in these agreements, and conclude the agreements with Central America, where we need to introduce greater measures of generosity. At the same time, Parliament welcomes the initiatives that you have put forward to establish the Europe-Latin America Foundation and also the financial investment facility. This summit is not, however, just another summit, Mrs Ashton. At this one, a very clear issue is going to be at stake. If we continue to lose our share of trade with the region, which has declined from 25% to just over 15% because of countries such as China, we are going to become irrelevant. Therefore, in line with the Spanish Presidency, I ask you, as High Representative and a Vice-President of the Commission, to send out a clear and very definite message regarding the commitment of this new Europe that we are building towards our old friends in Latin America. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their speeches. I would like to say to you, Mrs Ashton, that the fundamental element that will ensure that these relations move forward in the coming years will be the mobilisation of political will. Political reasons were behind the ministerial dialogue in San José in 1985; political reasons were behind the institutionalisation of the dialogue with the Rio Group in 1990; and political reasons were behind going over and above this in the summits mechanism. I would like to respond to Mr Kožušník by saying that we are indeed a community of values, and I would like to point out that in the last part-session, we adopted an important resolution on Cuba in which we called for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners. I would like to take this opportunity to ask Mrs Ashton to intercede on behalf of a dissident, Marta Beatriz Roque, who is on conditional release and is ill. She has just obtained Spanish nationality in a case promoted by a former MEP, Fernando Fernández Martín, so that she can come to Spain to be treated. However, we need to move from words to actions, and this is shown in the association agreements. I think, Mrs Ashton, that you have negotiated the agreements with Colombia and Peru very well. I think that although the human rights situation in Colombia still gives cause for concern, it has improved substantially. The Colombian people are clamouring for peace, and this agreement is definitely deserved. I also sincerely believe that a majority in Parliament is in favour of this agreement. Mrs Ashton, we need to give the Central Americans some room to breathe in the negotiations. We represent 25% of their exports, and they represent 2% of ours. We need to be generous and, as you said, we need to re-launch the agreement with Mercosur. To conclude, Mr President, I think that on the one hand, the European Union is in decline, in economic terms, and on the other, it is strengthened by the presence of the High Representative. Therefore, we need her to make a significant effort to demonstrate our political will at the Madrid Summit and to continue keeping relations with Latin America high on the European Union’s agenda.

on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, when my group asked for this matter to be included on the agenda, it did not do so in order to highlight errors, which are sometimes irreparable, in policies that indulge the enemies of freedom. It also did not do so in order to gain political return from this condemnation. It did so in order that Parliament, which is the institution at the democratic heart of the European Union, could speak out to condemn the death of an innocent person, and, above all, to express its solidarity with those in Cuba who are fighting, living and dying, like Orlando Zapata, for their freedom and their dignity. As the European Commission said, the Council’s common position is still valid, and it is an honourable position because it asks for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners. It is also a consistent position, because it asks for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be respected, in order for Cuba to be rooted in our system of values and not in foreign systems such as those of China or Vietnam. Madam President, the words of a brave man, Oswaldo Paya, who won the Sakharov Prize in 2002, still resound in this House. He said that the first victory to be proclaimed was that there was no hate in his heart. He said to those who oppressed him, who were his brothers, that he did not hate them, but that they were not going to impose their will through fear. He said that Andrei Sakharov left a legacy of dignity and of working towards peoples living together peacefully, and that often the voices that count the most are the voices that are not heard. In this House, we have not been able to hear the voices of the ‘Ladies in White’, 
who were also awarded the Sakharov Prize by Parliament. Now we will unfortunately not be able to hear the voice of Orlando Zapata, but soon we will be able to hear the voices of many more Cubans. In the meantime, Madam President, with the legitimacy that Parliament has in representing 500 million citizens from the 27 Member States of the Union, it needs to loudly and clearly echo the unstoppable shout of freedom that we are hearing from the beloved island of Cuba. (Applause) José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

Mr President, yesterday, during the debate on the motion for a resolution on which we are about to vote, we expressed our sorrow at the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a 42-year-old builder and Cuban political prisoner, who died after a hunger strike and many years of arbitrary, unjust, inhumane and cruel imprisonment. In this House yesterday, Commissioner Georgieva strongly and forcefully condemned this event. I am calling on you, Mr President, on behalf of Parliament, to send your condolences to Mr Zapata’s family, which is being harassed at his funeral. I would ask you to communicate to the Cuban authorities your strongest condemnation of this completely avoidable death, which the head of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, Elizardo Sánchez, described as a murder dressed up as justice. I hope, Mr President, that this death will lead to reflection among those who, out of good faith or naivety, want to change the Council’s common position, an honourable position that merely serves to link any improvement in relations with the island to human rights and fundamental freedoms, which, as we have seen, continue to be violated. (Applause) José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
).

Mr President, I think that this is an excellent opportunity to affirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights, which is what this motion for a joint resolution to be adopted tomorrow does. Parliament has expressed its opinion on several occasions, normally through the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World, and through various resolutions, as we did recently in the case of Iran. Some fellow Members have referred to the paradox – a word that they have used – of certain countries that have an extremely poor record on human rights being part of the body that is responsible for monitoring them, and I think that the case of Iran is one of the most obvious ones. This is not the only example, and I think that the United Nations will become ineffective if it is really resourced by these countries, and will lose all political legitimacy and moral authority to condemn these events. While I am talking about this, Mr President, this week, another of Parliament’s bodies has been considering the expulsion of a member of this House, the expulsion of Cuba. In addition, today we must mourn the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a 42-year old builder and political prisoner, who has died following a hunger strike and arbitrary, inhumane and cruel imprisonment. The Chair of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, Elizardo Sánchez, a person who is very close to the spirit of social democracy, has said that this death was entirely avoidable and that he considers it to be a murder dressed up as justice. Commissioner, I would like to ask you – as we already know the position of the President-in-Office – if you think, from an ethical and democratic point of view, in response to the deplorable events such as the death of Mr Zapata, and if the Commission thinks, that relations between the European Union and Cuba need to be raised to a higher level and given priority? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, like my fellow Members, I also wish to congratulate Mr Füle on having taken office and I hope that the excellent impression he made in his Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing will be confirmed over the course of his mandate, particularly in the sensitive area of enlargement. I would like to say a few words about Turkey, firstly to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the excellent results obtained in the committee. Her report, which refers to 2008 and 2009, neither overstates nor underplays matters; it highlights the efforts Turkey is making to try to meet the Copenhagen conditions and criteria. In my view, however, these efforts need to be considered within Turkey’s current context and political situation: seven years of Mr Erdoğan’s moderate Islamic government, with elections expected in July 2011; a country that is seething from the Operation Sledgehammer cases; from the annulment of the Emasya Protocol, which handed major powers over to the military; and, in particular, from the ruling that has banned the activities of the Democratic Society Party in Turkey. This context, Commissioner, means that the Turkish case needs to be handled with great caution. Turkey has to meet the conditions and requirements of the Copenhagen criteria and, obviously, it has to comply with the Ankara Protocol. However, in this particular context and situation, it goes without saying, Commissioner, that if any wrong signal is sent out, it could have very serious consequences for the security of the European Union, especially when the governing party does not have the three-fifths majority it needs in parliament in order to modify the constitution; such a signal could seriously give rise to alarming turmoil in an already unstable country that is a strategic partner for the West, in the context of the Atlantic Alliance. We need to use the utmost caution in the negotiating process in order not to make any mistakes. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, before we vote on this draft resolution on Iran, I merely wish to inform the Chamber that there has been an attempt to storm the Italian Embassy in Tehran and that similar incidents have also taken place at the embassies of other Member States, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Mr President, in Paragraph 24, this draft resolution calls for a European Union delegation to be established in Iran; my group would not want the adoption of this paragraph, which has been used in other European Parliament resolutions, to be taken as a sign of complacency with regard to these events. I would therefore ask Mr Füle to tell Mrs Ashton that the circumstances I have just mentioned should be borne in mind during the application of this resolution's mandate. I believe Mr Gahler is going to request the addition of an oral amendment to the resolution text so that the diplomatic interests of Member States can be protected in Iran.

Madam President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, I would first of all like to point out that the European Parliament has expressed its opinion on the situation of the prisoners in Guantánamo on various occasions through various resolutions. In his inauguration speech, President Obama said that he was making a commitment to close the Guantánamo detention centre within a year. This deadline passed on 22 January and the fact that it has not been closed is proof that often in politics it is easier to make promises than to keep them. Also, as the representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council said, President Obama’s personal representative has visited the European Union, met with our President and with several Member States and asked for our cooperation, which has to be offered on the basis of a series of premises mentioned by the Commissioner. One of these is that this is a problem created by the previous government of the United States, and that the European Union has to cooperate, but on the basis of certain requirements, in particular, the security of our Member States. In this respect, I would like to recall the decision made by some Member States, including the one that currently holds the Presidency of the Council, my own country. I would like to ask the representative of the Spanish Presidency if he is thinking of taking any additional measures to try to harmonise the response of the Member States to the problems that have arisen in Yemen in particular, or whether he is intending to leave this decision to the individual and sovereign context of each Member State, as decided by the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs. One final question, Madam President: it is indeed true that 100 out of the 190 or so prisoners that remain have been sent to their countries of origin or to third countries, and that 40 are going to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts. There are, however, still 50 that are not going to be released because there is not sufficient proof to take them into custody but the risk that they actually pose has forced the United States Government to decide that they should not be released. I would like to ask the Commission and the Council what they think about the situation of these 50 people who are not going to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

 Mr President, I would firstly like to say that the intergovernmental treaty was the only possible solution in an emergency situation. However, this treaty means a redistribution of sovereignty, a new social compact, and requires greater involvement on the part of the Commission and Parliament in order to give it legitimacy. What was the aim of these agreements? Two things, as President Van Rompuy has said. Firstly, to convince the markets that we want to continue together, that this is not a pegged exchange rate system that can be reversed at any time, and secondly, to stabilise the markets. I agree that, over the medium term, fiscal union was absolutely essential, because this crisis has been caused in part by government excess. However, it is not just the excesses of governments that have caused the crisis. Ireland and Spain had sound public finances and yet they are also in difficulties, because they were not competitive enough, because there was too much private indebtedness. This is why I place enormous importance on correcting macro-economic imbalances, which has gone somewhat unnoticed, and enormous importance on the issue of growth, which has gone unnoticed too. The uncertainty is greater with regard to stabilising the markets. I agree that we have corrected the private participation mistake: it was an error and we have put it right now. We have made a little progress on rescue mechanisms, but I am not sure that the provision made will be sufficient and that we will have the financing resources to make them effective. There are questions about leveraging the temporary mechanism and doubts about the permanent mechanism. Mr Barroso, I ask you to continue with the basket of bonds that, in my opinion, would be a good way of financing this fund. It would overcome the fragmentation in the debt market and make sovereign debt a risk-free asset once again. The European Central Bank will only act if it believes the summit will bring security, and we will see in the coming days whether it does or not. However, if it does not, it will have to seek alternative options, because we cannot go into battle against the crisis with one arm tied behind our backs. If the Member States have to insure against possible losses, then let them do so, but let us find a way of stabilising the markets that, may I say, are not doing well at all right now. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I think that, in order for this exercise to be useful, we should start by telling the truth. The truth is that we are not capable of resolving any of the problems that we have on the table: neither the problem of Greece, nor the problem of Italy. This incapacity to resolve these problems is affecting every economy in the European Union, it is rendering the efforts of Ireland and Portugal useless, and it is spreading contagion everywhere, including to Belgium and France. The truth is that the penalty for sovereign debt does not arise for economic reasons, because the foundations of our current account deficit are better than those of the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. Therefore, if it does not arise for economic reasons, it is because it arises only for political reasons. We have not succeeded in finding the right model, and we do not have the institutional structures to resolve the issue. Up to now, all the solutions that have been adopted – and many have been discussed – all those that have been accepted are based on a restrictive fiscal policy and a restrictive monetary policy; this simply has not worked. Now is probably the time to consider whether we should look at other models, for example the Anglo-Saxon model, which is based on a lighter fiscal policy and an ultra–accommodating monetary policy. Obviously we cannot import the model to the European Union exactly as it is. No state, except probably Germany, is in a position to boost public spending, lower taxes or borrow. The room for manoeuvre is very limited, and it will be necessary to submit to fiscal discipline. We can, however, do this at EU level, and that is what you are responsible for. What needs to be done? I think that in the first place the European Central Bank has to do much more that it is doing now. Since 2007, the Federal Reserve has increased its budget by 226%. The European Central Bank has increased its budget by 103%. The Bank of England has a volume of debt equal to 16% of the gross domestic product of the United Kingdom. That of the European Central Bank is only 2%. Secondly, a bailout fund will have to be put in place using Eurobonds – with joint responsibility until the Treaty is amended – but before 9 December. It will then be necessary to cater for growth using the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the project bonds, which are like the Loch Ness monster: we all talk about it but nobody has seen it. If that is not done, what Minister Tremonti said in Italy will happen: the Titanic will sink and it will take everyone with it, including the first class passengers. That is your responsibility. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, the fact that there was fumata bianca
 this morning is good news, albeit good news which I would like to clarify. The restructuring of the Greek debt is also good news, but we would do well to admit that we were wrong, because, under the initial conditions, Greece would never have been able to pay. If we had acted sooner, the Greek people would have suffered less and the cost of the bailout would have been lower. Recapitalisation of the banks: I need to look at it in detail, but I do not really understand why they have changed the criteria for evaluating sovereign debt, but have made no alteration to the evaluation of toxic assets, and I do not understand why they have set a ‘one size fits all’ rule for the limit on capital, thus establishing similar recapitalisation limits for financial institutions which, in fact, are not similar. The Spanish Government will have to explain the transfers that it has carried out, but that will be done at home. On the other hand, the Commission does have to explain to us here why we are facing a banking crisis without it having submitted the proposal for a directive on crisis resolution mechanisms, as it promised to do when we spoke about financial supervision. A new storm, and still the lifeboats are not ready. Lastly, it is good news that they are boosting the firepower of the bailout fund. It is just a shame that we have to look externally because we are incapable of sorting out our own problems internally, and we will only do so if we have a comprehensive plan that simultaneously addresses macro-economic discipline, debt sustainability and, above all, growth. It is time that the Commission came up with a universal plan and for us to get moving. If we have to amend the Treaties, well, let us do it, but we need to do it in stages, starting now. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, we are clearly in a serious situation that calls for all of us to be responsible. All of us, including the Council. The difference that separates us today from the Council is the issue of reverse qualified majority voting. We all know that the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has not worked because the Member States have decided not to punish each other for any violation of budgetary discipline. Perhaps this is because they have read in the Gospel the quote that says, ‘Let he who is without sin cast the first stone’. What this Parliament wants – and this is what distinguishes it from the Council – is to put an end to this joyous camaraderie between governments, and replace a biased referee with an impartial one. The package is good and deserves to be voted through. When times are hardest, no one would ever consider saying that we have to spend more. What we are now doing is restoring budgetary discipline. However, when something is good it is not necessarily enough. The speeches we have heard today have shown several things. We all knew that the eurozone was not an optimum currency area. Everyone thought that the current institutional framework – a centralised monetary policy, a Stability and Growth Pact, and the coordination of the other economic policies – would enable the differences between Member States to be overcome, or at least reduced. That has not been the case. In the good times, their differences only increased; in the bad times, the pillars on which the monetary union was established were left in ruins. The ‘no-bailout’ principle, the ‘no-default’ principle, and now the ‘no-exit’ principle could also be out the window. We now find ourselves in Lenin’s ‘What is to be done?’ situation. The only solution is to move forward on the issue of political union. I welcome the issue of Eurobonds. It is a positive step in that direction, but more needs to be done. If establishing a political union requires reforming the Treaties by convening a convention, so be it. There is a Greek proverb that says, ‘rules are made for man, and not man for rules’. It is not a question of continuing trialogues until three o’clock in the morning or holding ministerial meetings at six o’clock in the morning. From now on let us think about what can be done to remedy this situation. The first step, however, is to vote in favour of this package, which is a good step in the right direction. Otherwise we will be making a futile effort and, as Mr Ortega y Gasset was just saying, futile effort leads to melancholy and – in politics – to opposition. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

 (ES) 
Madam President, this issue raises a question, just one question: at European level what can we do to give work to those who do not  have it? To respond to that question I want to make clear the first agreed point. There can be no sustainable growth without a stable macroeconomy. Some of the quick solutions that have been proposed here, especially from the leftwing Members, would mean bread for today and hunger for tomorrow. The second agreed point is that Europe 2020 is a compendium of good intentions, it sounds good, but we have to move from contemplation to action. What are we going to do? How are we going to finance the proposed initiatives and actions? Is the ambition contained in the words of the 2020 Strategy compatible with the budgets cuts that have been announced? The third agreed point is that we need a complete picture if we are to set ourselves on the right path towards stable growth. To date this picture does not yet exist. What is currently happening in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council shows that among them there are a huge amount of scattered, incoherent and inconsistent ideas. There are three important actions to be taken. Firstly, stifling countries in difficulties cannot continue, and can be solved by a joint issuing of European bonds. Secondly, the bonds specified in the Monti Report have to be implemented, but they are not mentioned in the Europe 2020 Economic Strategy. Thirdly, we have to use the European Investment Bank’s resources, two thirds of which are the Commission’s, and which would only have to be increased fourfold in 10 years in order to equal the money that the Marshall Plan had for the reconstruction of the European economy. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, anyone who reads the newspapers today will find out two things: that we are at a crucial point in the sovereign debt crisis, and that the European response is a succession of isolated provisions with no internal consistency. Even now, we have on the table the European Semester, the economic governance package, the provisional and permanent rescue strategy, the so-called ‘Eurobonds’ to cover part of the sovereign debt that is considered to be secure, plus an action plan based on the European Investment Bank and bonds for specific projects, which is in the proposal that the Commission sent us on the internal market. The first thing that the rapporteurs are trying to do is to combine all of this and create a complete design, a final picture to be shown to the public. Secondly, this design needs to be a European design that does not divide Europe in two – let us not stumble into a two-speed Europe – and that pursues two objectives with equal intensity: budgetary discipline – as much as is necessary – and economic growth to bring us out of the crisis that we are in. I have one comment regarding the rescue mechanism to which the President-in-Office of the Council was referring. In his first statement, he said that private investors would participate in the rescue plans, which caused shock and led to a protest by the President of the European Central Bank. It was explained, as Mr Van Rompuy did just now, that firstly, it would be case-by-case – who decides and based on what criteria? – and secondly, that it would be done according to the criteria and policies of the International Monetary Fund. The only case in which the International Monetary Fund has used this type of rescue plan was in Argentina in 2003; it plunged the country into chaos, from which it has still not emerged, and the private bondholders have still not been paid. Regarding Eurobonds, many issues have been set out here today. I would just like to add two more. It would create a market as liquid as that in the United States, and would give a boost to the euro as a reserve currency, enabling the central banks and sovereign funds to invest their reserves here. My final comment is that this needs to be complemented by the European Investment Bank and the specific bonds to respond to growth. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, I am not going to emphasise what has already been said. The Belgian Presidency has been excellent. I would like to mention two highlights: financial supervision and the European Semester. Regarding these highlights, I would like to say what has been done and, most importantly, what needs to be done. In terms of financial supervision, in the space of 48 hours, the Minister, Mr Reynders, managed to get a dossier that was in deadlock moving, and we were able to give the Council and the Commission what the Commission had asked of us: European authorities that could begin operating on 1 January 2011: strong, authentically European authorities with clout. What happened next is not very reassuring. We still do not have presidents for the authorities; we have an extraordinarily small budget and I am told that the rewards for those who are going to hold positions in these authorities are not brilliant. They are, of course, much less brilliant than the bonuses received by bankers in London. There are two matters that still need to be dealt with: the regulation of the systemic bodies, and contributions and taxes on banking. In the regulation of systemic bodies, we want the European authority to be responsible for supervision, through the national authorities, which, in this case, would act as agents and would be subject to the instructions of the European authority. The alternative would not make sense. In terms of taxation, the most recent offering from Commissioner Šemeta sets out all the possible taxes for banks. Parliament has already adopted two contributions: the contribution to the coordinated guarantee funds and the contribution to the banking stability funds. This is a fact, and next we will be able to discuss the tax on banking or taxes on banking transactions, because, I stress, the rest is a fact. In terms of the European Semester, the only thing that we want is to coordinate with everything: with Eurobonds, with project bonds, with the mechanism, etc. … (The President cut off the speaker) José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, what we need right now are clear rules, and what we are doing is precisely the opposite. I am therefore going to make a few proposals in order to re-establish clarity. In the European semester, Parliament wants to focus on a series of discussions, which are currently unfocused and do not fit with public opinion. We want the political responses to the recommendations made to the Member States over the next six months to be taken into account when establishing the penalties provided for in the legislative package on governance. My group would like to make it clear that there are no magic solutions in the legislative package for getting us out of the crisis. There are the well-known methods of budgetary discipline and structural reforms in order to maintain competitiveness. With regard to the crisis mechanism, as you said yesterday, Commissioner, President Barroso promised us here that it was going to be a European mechanism. Today the Council is proposing an intergovernmental mechanism. Is this European – in Mr Barroso’s terms – because it appears that the fund will be based in Europe rather than in the Cayman Islands, or does the Commission intend to help us to create a mechanism following EU procedure in which Parliament has a contribution to make? With regard to eurobonds, the Commission, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the experts say that it is a good idea, but that it is a premature idea, therefore we are late. What I propose to the Commission is that we begin a debate to shape a system of eurobonds that gives reasonable financing to the countries that do the right thing and punishes those that do not by forcing them to go to the markets at rates that are genuine deterrents. That is the only workable way of combining fiscal discipline and economic growth. Do not come back to me with discussions about whether it is too early or too late, because what we know now is that we have always been too late. Let us see if, for once, by changing the rules, we can be early. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

Madam President, Commissioner, the two block exemption regulations, one of which refers to specialisation agreements and the other to research and development, will expire on 31 December of this year. The Commission has drawn up two legislative proposals: two proposals for regulations that are before this House to replace the regulations that are now coming to an end. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since the initial regulations were adopted. There have been significant changes in legislation, especially the 2003 modernisation package, crucial legal judgments have been passed in this area and the Commission has learnt quite a lot from practice, which is also an important aspect. The Commission opened two rounds of consultations with those concerned, which is good practice in the spirit of legislating well and having public support. The big question now is as follows: what use is it going to make of the responses from those concerned during the consultation? Is it going to take notice of them or are these opinions simply going to be thrown in the bin? In this context, what Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs want to know is essentially six things. What are the suggestions and specific ideas that the stakeholders have put forward that the Commission is going to take into account when it comes to designing and defining these regulations and taking them from ‘the muses to the theatre’? Secondly, what does the Commission think about the horizontal agreements that are not covered by the exemption regulations on specialisation or research and development. What did the stakeholders say in this round of consultations? What would be the advantages from the point of view of industry, the real economy and protecting competition, of proposing new regulations to take into account horizontal agreements that are not covered by the two block exemption regulations that we are currently considering? Does the Commission intend to draw up new regulations to cover them? Yes or no? The question is relatively clear. The third problem that was debated at length in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is the subject of what is known as ‘patent ambush’, which, as the Commissioner is aware, takes place when one of the stakeholder companies that is participating in establishing standards withholds information on the patents that it holds or the patents that it is planning to register in future. This causes serious damage and inconvenience to those companies that are unaware of that information and commit to acting according to the parameters established. The question here is relatively specific as this is a case of distortion of competition and barriers in the internal market, which is the cardinal sin in our institution: does the Commission intend to tackle the problem of ‘patent ambush’ in the framework of the new draft regulations, or otherwise, does it consider that complementary sector-specific legislation would be necessary to avoid abuse of patent rights? Is the Commission committed to ensuring that there is an integrated, consistent legislative framework without internal contradictions between competition rules and sector-specific legislation in the area of intellectual property rights? The fourth and fifth questions relate to economic governance or, if you prefer, governance of competition. We have learnt that we need to try to converge with other competition authorities and, in this respect, it is important to know to what extent the Commission, in drawing up these regulations, has made use of court decisions and the decisions of national and international authorities. The last question refers to a subject that is a particularly sensitive one for my committee, and I am sure that Mr Schwab will have something to say about it. It refers to the marketing chain for food products. It seems obvious that there is inequality in conditions among producers, between farmers, on the one hand, and large chains, on the other. Does the Commission intend to do something to guarantee equal, fair treatment for the weaker party in this contract? These are the questions, Commissioner, that I would like to you to answer as fully, clearly and precisely as possible. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

Madam President, today is a good day for Europe. In December, we had a poor agreement and now, thanks to the cooperation between Parliament, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, we have a good agreement. It is a good agreement that is going to establish genuinely European authorities that are strong and subject to the democratic control of Parliament: authorities that are going to be designed to ensure that all the banks are subject to the same rules across the European Union. They will be able to impose their decisions on the national supervisory bodies and, if they do not comply with them, on the private banks, in order to protect families and businesses. This will enable them to combat the banks that could cause systemic risks and prevent taxpayers from having to pay once again for the irrational exuberance of some financial institutions. The lesson that we can learn from this debate is that Parliament is not like a dog whose bark is worse than his bite that will back down at the slightest gesture from the Council: it holds firmly to its positions. Nor is it a dog in the manger: it is a good ally of the Council and the Commission for moving forward in the process of European integration. Thanks to my fellow Members, Commissioner Barnier and Mr Reynders, we now have an excellent agreement on which we should congratulate ourselves. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

 Madam President, on behalf of my group – and I believe on behalf of all the rapporteurs – I am going to request that, within the following reports that make up this package – the Giegold report, the Goulard report, my own report and the Skinner report – the amended Commission proposal be put to a roll-call vote. It is important to know that Parliament has the level of mandate that we have to negotiate with the Council. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, I would like quite simply to thank the other rapporteurs, as we have worked together in an exemplary manner on what was a difficult package: we had before us a Council agreement that had been approved unanimously. Parliament now has a mandate that was also approved practically unanimously, with the enormous advantage that the winds are blowing in Parliament’s direction and not that of the Council’s text, which now seems extraordinarily archaic. Thank you to my group, thank you to all of the groups, and thank you to Parliament, which has won an important victory today. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Cassandra had a gift: that of telling the future. She also bore a curse: that of not being listened to. For this reason, Troy fell. Parliament anticipated more than 10 years ago that liberalising the markets, without putting in place European supervision mechanisms at the same time, would lead to a crisis in the system, for one very simple reason: cross-border institutions cannot be supervised by national authorities whose jurisdiction ends at their borders. They can only be supervised by European authorities. We did not take heed of this, and the crisis erupted. Exotic products, unknown even to their creators, flooded the markets. Nobody trusted anybody else, nobody lent to anybody else, and credit dried up. The result: 23 million unemployed and EUR 3.5 billion – one third of our production – committed to aid the financial sector. Now what? We in Parliament have been at odds with the Council for some days now. Parliament has given a great deal of ground in order to reach an agreement; the Commission too. The Belgian Presidency has shown great willing. It has asked us for time. We are going to give it time, but let us show today that Parliament is united, that it has very clear ideas. For this reason, let us vote massively in favour tomorrow of the amendments that the most influential groups within this House have put forward jointly. There are several ideas that Parliament would like to highlight. The first is that the crisis will only be overcome when confidence recovers and transparency is re-established within markets, institutions and products. This will only be possible when there are European supervision authorities that are credible, strong, independent and subject to democratic control: authorities that are not limited to meekly repeating the slogans emanating from national governments. What does it mean to say that they are European? It means that they must have real power to ban the sale of toxic products; it means that they have real power to put an end to the regulatory distortions that prevent the market from working; it means that they must have real power to require national supervisors to always operate in defence of European interests. National supervisors cannot be feudal lords invested with absolute power. The European authority must ensure that the law is obeyed, that national authorities do what they need to do when there is a threat of pandemic, and that they are able to resolve conflicts when colleges of supervisors do not want to do so, or cannot. They need to be able to require private institutions that are offside to do what they need to do when national colleges of supervisors notice any omissions within the European guidelines. The second lesson is that, among cross-border institutions, there is a special, singular type: those known as systemic institutions. An elementary truth about capitalism is that when it is done well, money is made, and when it is done badly, money is lost. This governs everything except systemic institutions. When things are going well, they make a fortune, and when things are going badly, it is the taxpayer who has to run to their aid. To resolve the problem of systemic institutions, there are only two solutions, only two: either supervisors within the countries where they operate are given greater powers to control their solvency and liquidity, which would lead to the removal of the European Parliament from the equation, or truly European institutions are put in place, which is what this House is proposing. This means that European authorities need to watch over these institutions with particular zeal, as their ruin will be the ruin of all. It means that the European institution needs to be provided with resolution and control mechanisms for stabilising endangered institutions, if this is possible, or to wind them up, if this is not possible. Lifeboats should be made ready before the voyage, not in the middle of a storm. Also, these systemic institutions need to be required to pre-finance, to provide funds for guaranteeing the interests of depositors, which is our main concern, and for paying the costs of a crisis when it occurs. What cannot happen is for the taxpayer to have to carry the can again. What cannot happen, as the Americans say so often, is for ‘Main Street’ to have to pay for the excesses of ‘Wall Street’ again. I would ask the ladies and gentlemen of the Council who are absent today – they have been very active this morning, talking on the telephone, and it seems that the storm has passed and things are calm, and they are still not here – to convey the same message through the Commissioner. The Council has asked for time. Parliament has given it time. Let nobody be confused, however: this is not a sign of weakness. This is a sign of the strength of this House. The strength of a body that believes in what it says, and feels that it has the support of the public, who back it. The Council and the Commission, which is doing a magnificent job, needs to make use of this time to forge a parliamentary consensus on the European direction, in the direction of Europe. It must not make use of this time to try and put together blocking minorities in opposition to Parliament. I ask the Council to listen to Cassandra for once. Today, Cassandra is the rapporteurs who have spoken. Cassandra is also Commissioner Barnier. Those who are not Cassandra know only too well to whom I refer. Listen to Parliament, seek an agreement, say here what was said in Toronto. Do not say one thing here and another there. As old Castilians say, if the Council does this, God will reward it, and if not, God will demand it. God and this House. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, please inform the Council that there is a convergence of opinions in this House that is rarely seen. The Council must take note: for six months, it has been telling us that it had a fixed mandate from the Swedish Presidency, and now we also have a mandate. While we are talking about Cassandra, the important thing is not to prophesise the past, which is what the Spanish Presidency did, but to prophesise the future, which is what the Belgian Presidency seems to want to do. We have a consensus that is just as strong as the one within the Council, with an added advantage, which is that the winds favour Parliament’s stance and do not favour the old and anachronistic stance that the Council maintained up until the start of the Belgian Presidency. We have the advantage that we incorporated proposals that had been rejected; proposals that were in the de Larosière report, such as the resolution mechanisms to which Mrs Ferreira has referred. It makes no sense to put in place a supervisor that can forecast the weather but cannot do anything in the case of shipwreck. We have the advantage that we anticipated things that other institutions said later. When we talked about systemic institutions, we were told that there was no such species; the European Council acknowledged its existence in March. When we talked about how the taxpayer should not have to bear the cost of the crisis and that pre-financed funds should be established by the sector for facing up to its responsibilities, we were told that this was premature, utopian or simply idiotic. Then, the Europe 2020 strategy adopted by the Commission said it, Ecofin said it, the European Council said it and took it to Toronto, and I would not understand why they are not advocating it now.

Mr President, I would like to talk about financial supervision, which is the only real tangible manifestation of this ethereal idea that we call economic governance, and I must say that we are in a real ceremony of confusion. Just this morning, the rotating President of the Union declared that we are close to an agreement. He urged us to get moving, and both these statements are economical with the truth. We are not close to an agreement, and it is also not the job of the Presidency of the Council to tell the rest of us to get moving. What it needs to do is to get itself moving, and I will tell you in which direction it needs to go. The Council agreement is, as has been said here, an agreement of minimums; it is an agreement that is wanted by some European authorities whose only competences are to propose technical harmonisation rules for a standard interpretation of European law. There was no need to go to so much trouble. This could have been done by the Commission with Article 290, based on the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, which is in force. What Parliament has said is as follows: firstly, that pan-European banks must be supervised by a genuinely European authority that is strong and subject to control by Parliament; secondly, that the banks whose collapse could drag us all down should be subject to special vigilance; thirdly, that when one of these banks gets into difficulties, the banking authority should have a toolbox to prevent infection, restructure the bank and liquidate it in an orderly fashion without the debris landing on the taxpayers’ heads; and fourthly, that there should be two funds pre-financed by the sector itself, in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, so that we do not end up all paying once again for what Crispin charitably called the irrational exuberance of a few. Mr Barroso, the first time that I saw a high representative of the Spanish Government was on Monday. Before the start of the Spanish Presidency, they were given ...

Madam President, I am going to keep to my time limit and be very specific. I am going to tell the Council and the Commission exactly what they need to do in a week’s time if they want an agreement on the financial package. The major premise is that the future is looking brighter than it was a while ago, but there are still some clouds on the horizon. According to the International Monetary Fund, USD 800 billion are owed in losses not disclosed by the banks, and the international bank has lent USD 2.2 billion to southern economies that are at risk. The reform of the financial markets needs to happen now, because what is important is not that there might be a crisis – which there might be – but that we have put the measures in place to navigate it. The second premise is that there are significant disagreements between the Council and Parliament with regard to the European supervision package. Parliament wants the entities that could cause the system to collapse and endanger the real economy to be supervised more strictly by a genuinely European authority. That is economic governance. We also want mechanisms to be established now to remodel the entities that could cause the whole system to collapse. This is not about rescuing them, but about remodelling them and, if necessary, liquidating them without spreading the infection or rescuing them as a result, as it is always the same people who pay for this. Thirdly, the ‘polluter pays’ principle requires the sector to establish a fund to pay the costs of the crisis. The Council has a week to do what the Larosière report said and to reach an agreement in Parliament; if not, the rotating Presidency of the Council will be entirely responsible. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, Commissioner, we know a number of things. We know that this crisis has been like a mutating virus: it began as a property crisis, later becoming a banking crisis, then an economic crisis, and ended up as a sovereign debt crisis that could bring other crises in the sector in its wake. We also know that this crisis has been very expensive. According to your services, aid commitments to the financial sector total EUR 3.5 billion: in other words, one third of the EU’s gross domestic product. We also know that one of the root causes of the crisis was the lack of transparency in products, institutions and markets. That is why the report that we are discussing at the moment is so important. However, if you want a statistic, I would remind you that in the United States alone, in the years 2000-2006, asset-backed securities increased by a factor of four and mortgage-backed securities by a factor of seven; moreover, in a very recent court appearance, the advisors of a reputable bank said that they did not have a very good idea of what they were selling. We also know – and this is the third statement – that many of the commitments that we made at the G20 have not gone, to quote a Spanish poet, ‘from the Muses to the theatre’ – they have not gone from imagination to the written word. We also know that throughout this remodelling of the financial sector, there are three principles which I see as key: Pan-European entities must be supervised by pan-European authorities; we must have the necessary measures at our disposal to detect the virus and avoid infection; and, finally, we must prevent the public from having to pay by itself for those infections that it has not caused. Commissioner, you have a major job to do if we do not want the next crisis to catch us with our pants down. I will end by saying in French that I recommend ‘de l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace
’ in your mission – boldness, more boldness and forever boldness. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I am going to try to say two new things on the subjects with which the European Council has been dealing: the 2020 strategy and the regulation of the financial markets. As regards the 2020 strategy, all of us here have been saying for quite some time that one of the reasons for the relative failure of the Lisbon Strategy was that there were not enough tools to oblige Member States to honour their commitments. Now the Commission and the European Council are coming to us with a proposal that is more of the same: a weak agreement that makes reference to Articles 121 and 136 of the Treaty. The President-in-Office of the Council began the Spanish Presidency by saying that he was aware of this weakness and that he wanted more: that he wanted to strengthen economic governance. I ask you now, Mr President of the European Council: ‘Where are the courtly gallantries? The deeds of love and high emprise, In battle done?’ What has happened to these intentions? As regards financial regulation, I have one piece of bad news and two of good news. The bad news is that the Council has decided to delay the regulation of alternative investment funds – known as casino capitalism – at precisely the time when these funds have been partly responsible for the speculation on the Greek economy. The first piece of good news is that the 2020 strategy talks about obliging financial institutions to put money aside to pay for some of the plates they smash; or, as President Obama would put it, to avoid Main Street having to pay for the damage caused by Wall Street. The second is that for the first time the Council is singling out the systemic institutions to which it wishes to pay particular attention. These two things feature in the reports that Parliament is currently debating. They do not feature in the agreement that the Council reached in December. I would like to see the Council taking these two ideas up again, because then we will be much closer to playing ball. Believe me, Mr President, I am really keen to play ball with the Council that you are chairing. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
).  
– (ES)
 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are more aware than anyone of how my party wanted to help make the Spanish Presidency a success. We want to continue doing so, but for that you need to make some adjustments and you need to get on with leading the Union right away. Leading the Union means seeking a solution for Greece. Everyone has said so and I am not going to repeat it. Leading the Union means approving the Directive on alternative investment fund managers as soon as possible and not delaying it, which is what the Spanish Presidency has done. Leading the Union means approving the financial surveillance package as soon as possible, not upholding at all costs a Council agreement that is much more conservative than the Commission’s proposal and even more so than the de Larosière report from which it derives. Parliament will provide the Spanish Presidency with a supervision agreement that can be summarised in two words: more supervision and more Europe. I am sure that the Spanish Government, which has always preached these ideas, will support Parliament and not the other positions that originate from the other side of the Channel. Leading the Union means strengthening budgetary discipline, and strengthening budgetary discipline means coming up with new ideas to strengthen the preventive aspect. The Spanish Prime Minister knows that the review of the fourteen stability plans that have just been referred to was a purely bureaucratic procedure in the absence of a better idea. The preventive arm would have to take into account the competitiveness of the economies – because without wealth, there is no way of balancing the public accounts – and it would have to take the foreign account situation into consideration. Tougher sanctions would also have to be implemented so that the agreement really appears binding. Leading the Union means bringing in a new idea on the issue of governance, on which you have just written in a newspaper. The Spanish Prime Minister told us here how he wanted more governance when Articles 121 and 136 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which are the ones to which the Spanish Presidency now refers, are already in force. What else does it involve? Tell us what it involves and we will help you. In order to help you, however, we need to know what it is you expect and want, because in this House, vague, vacuous and empty ideas get very short shrift. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, we are here for the first time in the history of the euro to talk about the financial situation of a handful of countries. I am emphasising the word ‘countries’, because the Spanish Presidency sounded like it was talking about outer space, and Commissioner Almunia only mentioned Greece. I would like to know whether the Commissioner continues to maintain in his closing speech that the problems of Spain and Portugal are similar to those of Greece and if so, what he would do about it. However, we are here to talk about these financial situations because the finances of a few could ruin the credibility of the currency of all and open the door to a two-speed Europe. The gap could increase when the exit strategy referred to by the Spanish Presidency is implemented, because we could find that the less developed countries have to deal with monetary difficulties and harsher monetary policies and, more importantly, have to use much more money to pay off debts and much less money to create employment. Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, without a sustainable economy, it will be impossible to balance finances. Without employment, tax revenue will continue to fall and unemployment benefit payouts will continue to rise. We are facing a crisis of confidence, and when there is a crisis of confidence, the first thing we have to do is tell the truth. We have to say how we have ended up here. What are the affected countries doing to get themselves out of debt? Are the stability pacts credible or not? Above all, we need to know what they are doing to straighten out their economies, because as I said before, without sustained growth, there will not be a sustainable economy or sustainable finances. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with many of the points that have been made, but must qualify some others. I agree that it is too soon to take away the patient’s crutches, but that it is time to get him ready to walk without them. We still have to absorb excess liquidity in the markets, correct the imbalance in public finances and re-establish respect for competition rules. In Pittsburgh we must do several things that we cannot do alone: we have to set up early warning mechanisms that work, because those that we had did not work; we have to revise the regulatory framework, because the existing framework has not worked. I agree that it is important to regulate bonuses and tax havens. These are all necessary, but inadequate, measures. In my opinion, it is more important to re-build the muscle of financial institutions, limit debt and set up reserves in good times so that we can weather the bad times. It is more important to make an effort in terms of supervision. The Commissioner knows that I supported the de Larosière report, although I felt it was inadequate, because I would support more centralised supervision. However, it is clear that European supervision cannot function without close coordination with the supervisory authorities of the other major economic areas of the world. We also need to do something about trade. It is all well and good helping the emerging countries, but it is more important to lift the barriers that are still preventing trade in goods. Commissioner, the most important point is that we need to establish the foundations for stable and sustained growth over a generation. For this we need free markets, markets open to innovation, markets open to entrepreneurs, but also markets subject to a certain level of regulation. I will end with a quotation, which will be familiar to my compatriot Mr Almunia: ‘Publish not many edicts; when you do enact pragmatics and decrees, see that they be good ones and, above all, that they are well observed’, so said Don Quixote to his friend Sancho. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again the defence of the general interest by the Commission and Parliament is clashing with entrenched national self-interest in the Council. Given the prior acceptance of the legitimacy of both positions, it is essential to find a balance. There is absolutely no doubt as to the relevance of the next multiannual financial framework. The Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and I, on its behalf, must reiterate that the Presidency’s proposal is, in our opinion, unacceptable. A cut of EUR 75 billion in relation to what was already an inevitably meagre proposal from the European Commission is futile and of no use to anyone. That is not the only problem: these new direct cuts in the agricultural and cohesion policies go beyond the ‘red line’ that Spain drew at the start of this work. Ladies and gentlemen, now is not the time to debate a supposed dichotomy between austerity and growth. Some of us are making clear efforts and sacrifices to correct our deficit. Spain, however, like so many other countries, needs to grow, increase its economic activity and create jobs. With this budget, none of this will be possible; it is pushing us past breaking point. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot achieve more Europe with far fewer resources, especially if what we have is distributed unfairly. If that is the case, Spain will oppose a multiannual financial framework for the European Union that means, plain and simple, the end to any opportunities for growth and, above all, any remnant of solidarity, and that is precisely the direction that the European Council is taking. Luckily, that is not the path that the Commission has chosen, and I must thank it for its efforts to adapt a different approach. In relation to this point – the need for the Union, the need for combined efforts – I want to thank Mr Barroso who, the other day in Cadiz, made a convincing declaration regarding the interpretation of the Treaties in the case of any potential secession within the Union.  He stated clearly and unequivocally, as guardian of the Treaties, that if part of a Member State secedes and becomes an independent state it will be dealt with as a third country and, therefore, it will be in no way affected by the statements and the effects of the Treaty. I hope, Mr President, that this can be recognised and that the Commission’s sure and steady approach can remain alive as a guarantee for us all. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Eppink that he has just used the little time he had to dish out words of insult and condemnation from a position of absolute ignorance.  Is he familiar with the Spanish Constitution? Because all Vice-President Vidal Quadras said – nothing more and nothing less – was that the provisions of the Spanish Constitution should be enforced; anything else was merely the personal comments of an individual, which had no bearing on anything and which I respect as such, but with which I do not agree. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is an old principle that has passed from the legal to the political world and it is ‘pacta sunt servanda
’, which means ‘agreements must be kept’.  By that, I am referring to the important measures adopted by the European Council in June to put an end to the crisis in which we find ourselves. Since these agreements were adopted, market pressure has eased, with markets welcoming decisions capable of breaking the vicious circle between banks and sovereign debt, as well as plans to move towards a genuine economic and monetary union and the commitment to defend the euro at all costs.  Ladies and gentlemen, the European Council held last week undeniably achieved some positive results: satisfactory progress was made towards a banking union, while the agreement between the 27 Member States on the creation of a single supervisory mechanism is also to be welcomed; and it is right that this task should be entrusted to the euro area finance ministers. However, I must criticise the biased interpretations that have, unilaterally, been made in this respect. It is not acceptable to make personal interpretations that could misrepresent the mandate granted to the finance ministers, nor do we approve of describing as settled matters that were not even discussed.  We urgently need to move towards a real single supervisory mechanism that covers all financial institutions. A joint deposit guarantee scheme and a crisis resolution mechanism must also be implemented. The euro’s survival depends on the rapid creation of an effective banking union. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, it has been said that, in order for things to get better, sometimes the chaos needs to get worse. The feeling of powerlessness was such that Europe was forced to react, and it did so for the good of everyone, because the big winner of this summit was the euro. This triumph has revived the hope that Europe is emerging from its paralysis, moving from thought towards action. Ladies and gentlemen, it was essential to adopt short-term measures at this summit, in order to guarantee financial stability, along with long-term measures, in order to solve the Union’s shortcomings. In this case, immediate action was essential in order to continue working towards what is important. The imperative result was to send a message that the euro is a joint, irrevocable and irreversible project. Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome such important decisions as giving the European Stability Mechanism the facility to recapitalise banks directly, which will break the vicious circle between banking debt and sovereign debt; incidentally, the current Spanish Government has always advocated this theory. It will also help in terms of intervening in markets to support the public debt of the countries that are fulfilling their public deficit and reform commitments. These decisions were necessary in order to guarantee financial stability, which must be the European Union’s highest priority in the short term. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the time for some countries to resort to nationalist maxims and throw up obstacles. As I have already said, it is the time to support Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, Spain is providing and implementing, in record time, the most ambitious reform agenda in the history of Spanish democracy, which includes major employment reforms. It is also carrying out a financial reform, based on complete transparency, all of which demonstrates its commitment to fiscal consolidation and hitting its deficit targets. We also welcome the decision to launch a process for greater economic integration, using four building blocks: banking union, fiscal union, a common economic policy framework and enhanced democratic legitimacy. Mr President, the history of first the Community and then of the European Union has always shown that, not only do we overcome crises, but also we emerge from them stronger. I am delighted that, once again, we have achieved this. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, the first thing I should say is that the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) approves of and supports the two packages that have been presented today, both the employment package and the solidarity aid for Greece, which is consistent with your overall proposal. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no denying that we are experiencing difficult times, and daily events remind us that the crisis is still far from over. Unavoidably, the focus has shifted back to Spain. Alarm bells have been ringing in the markets, without justification, partly fuelled by statements that I consider to be inappropriate, Mr President. Some of those have been made in the context of important elections, in which opponents on both sides are making my country a dialectical element of their confrontation. Naturally, we do not welcome any of these references. Furthermore, as a way of turning the attention away from their own problems, others are showing little political sensitivity in their dealings with us. Today in Parliament, some have failed to show any finezza
, as the Italians would say, and there has been a lack of political tact. Ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the markets does not reflect Spain’s strength. We are a solvent country and we are entirely capable of tackling our debts. The Spanish debt remains below the European average, and the Spanish Government is fully committed to fulfilling the deficit targets agreed with the EU. Mr Swoboda, Mr Rajoy has never said that he cannot meet the targets set by the European Union. On the contrary, he said that he is ready to meet each and every one of those targets, and he repeats that on a daily basis. The Spanish Government, in the few months it has been in office, has adopted, and will continue to adopt, very ambitious measures in order to guarantee fiscal consolidation and lay the foundations for greater competitiveness, job creation and growth. In the outlook it made public yesterday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) itself admitted that the forecast was made prior to any analysis of the decisions and measures currently being taken by the Spanish Government. We have adopted other measures: the general State budget for 2012, which we believe will guarantee that we will meet the deficit target this year; the organic law on budgetary stability; a reform of the education and health care systems, which will be presented this month and allow for an adjustment of EUR 10 billion; and the reform of the financial sector, which is going to help the financial institutions to bring in more than EUR 50 billion. In short, Spain is meeting the targets set by the Commission, and we are calling on everyone to be responsible. We all need to find a way out of this together, Spain with everyone else, without a doubt; the criticisms being made are not at all helpful. Either all the countries find a way to act together to bring about growth and a new direction, or else it will be difficult for us to move forwards under the conditions proposed by the Commission.

 Mr President, Mr Romeva, would you like Mr Rajoy to speak in Parliament? I think that is a good idea, and I would have no objections. Mr Rajoy, however, is not the protagonist of this crisis. The protagonist of the crisis is the legacy left behind by the socialist, communist and green left-wing parties in Spain, who handed over the worst legacy in political history, and this was after they had been handed the best legacy ever left by any previous government.

Madam President, Commissioner Kallas, I would like to begin by saying that if this issue has seemed easy, if it is reaching a successful conclusion, it is due in great part to the dedicated, rigorous and flexible position of the rapporteur, Mr Fleckenstein. I would like to thank him, on behalf of my group, for being flexible enough to accept our points of view and getting us to the point where we almost have a consensus. Ladies and gentlemen, the history of the European Maritime Safety Agency is a success story. Day after day, it justifies its existence and the reason for its existence. The amendment to the regulation establishing EMSA does not seek to rectify errors; on the contrary, it aims to extend the agency’s competences in the light of new challenges and the emergence of new problems, and we believe that EMSA is the appropriate instrument for tackling and resolving those problems. Parliament wants to make sure that EMSA does not turn into a body with a life of its own, but continues to be guided by the Commission and continues to intervene at the request of the Commission itself or the Member States. The serious accident in the Gulf of Mexico has shown us that EMSA should be entrusted with helping the states to investigate accidents involving maritime, coastal or offshore installations. On a separate note, it is important to emphasise EMSA’s role in supporting the monitoring of the organisations recognised as classification societies, particularly as regards ensuring mutual recognition. It should be noted that the agency plays a key role in Port State Control and the fight against piracy. For the first time, the report makes explicit reference to the agency’s work involving the satellite-based monitoring of fishing vessels and ships fishing in dangerous waters, for example, through its close collaboration with Operation Atalanta. It is vital to comply with the environmental strategy and support EMSA assistance when necessary. As regards the composition of the Administrative Board, I believe that there should be a gender balance and that this should be stated in a recital. I think that it would be excessive to introduce it in an article. I also believe that it would be feasible to promote maritime training and exchanges of good practices among institutions and schools. We will not support the European network of training academies as each Member State has its own special characteristics and needs. Finally, Madam President, regretfully we have to vote against Amendments 18 and 41 because the aim is to exclude the word ‘national’. That is something that is neither ingenuous nor innocent. No one and no state, especially in these times when we are giving up sovereignty in return for economic efficiency, is prepared to accept that the word ‘national’, the existence of the states, should not be compatible, as indeed it should, with the existence of the Union of 27, soon to be 28.

Madam President, Commissioner, as you know, in 2008, Parliament roundly rejected the motion for a resolution that was presented to it. Later, in the same terms, the report that I myself presented to the Chamber was approved by a comfortable majority, with a great consensus and with the effort of the Commission and the political groups. What were the reasons behind Parliament’s change of mind? Undoubtedly, seeing that all the requirements involved in accepting the use of these scanners were fulfilled, including the preservation of fundamental rights and, among these, in particular, the passenger’s dignity and privacy, non-discrimination, protection of personal data and protection of health. In this way, we established what type of scanners were suitable for guaranteeing passengers’ security, on the one hand, and preserving their rights in full, on the other. The scanners will not use ionising radiation, they will not be mandatory for Member States, nor for citizens, and they will all protect the rights described above. True, the Commission has captured all of these concerns in its proposed legislation but, in addition to scanners that use stick figures, it includes the possibility of another type which, whilst guaranteeing the same catalogue of rights, permits the inspection of an image of the passenger, albeit blurred. We accept the reasons why it has proven necessary to include this alternative as an authorised method of control. Parliament also defends the need to guarantee fair competition and thus avoid any monopolistic temptation. However, today we call on the Commission to retain all the precepts that we defended in my report, all the guarantees of preservation of fundamental rights. Moreover, we encourage it to work with industry and the Member States in order to ensure that in the near future, only automatic protection scanners are used and that no inspector is needed to view any image.

 I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Fidanza, for an excellent report and for his good work in bringing on board the many ideas that have been put forward in this House to make European tourism a key asset of our economy. Tourism constitutes one of the Union’s largest sources of revenue, and in my country, Spain, it is essential to have a sound tourism policy that continues to attract tourists from across the world and helps to foster economic growth at a time of crisis. The European Parliament has, for the first time, expressed itself politically on this subject, and it has done so by supporting the work of the Commission, but also by setting forth new ideas that enrich future tourism policy following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon. It is not a question of harmonising, as this is precluded by Article 195 of the Treaty, but of supplementing national policies to improve service quality, to couple the ‘Europe brand’ with national brands, and to create budget lines that reinforce national policies. With a view to countering seasonality in the sector, I have helped boost the role of social tourism, paying particular attention to tourism for the elderly on the basis of the Spanish experience. I considered it fundamental to support small and medium-sized enterprises and to develop entrepreneurship in the industry, as a driving force for employment. The goal is to consolidate Europe’s image and visibility as a collection of sustainable, quality destinations, and to foster the competitiveness of the European tourist industry. In a global world where new markets are emerging, Parliament has an undeniable opportunity to maintain Europe’s status as the primary tourist destination in the world and to contribute to economic growth by bringing different cultures closer together. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 Mr President, we are all part of a whole, and nobody can survive alone. This emergency requires a joint effort and sacrifice. It is now being demanded that the Union show leadership, and that the mechanisms for governing and decision-making function in real time. The monetary union cannot survive without unambiguous political leadership. It needs economic governance, a common budget, a certain level of fiscal harmonisation and an emergency plan. Therefore, we first need to regulate public accounts, correct macroeconomic imbalances and stimulate competitiveness. No country should spend more than its economic growth allows. On the other hand, the intergovernmental nature of the financial stability mechanism is regrettable. The European Union needs a permanent crisis resolution mechanism under the Community method: a European Monetary Fund. If Europe wants to see leadership, ladies and gentlemen, then those decisions must be driven by Parliament and the Commission, rather than by the Council, which is hindered and slowed down by the national governments. It is the responsibility of Member States to do their homework in order to help with the decisions of the Union as a whole, and to do all they can to succeed in this vital task: achieve economic growth and create employment. More than one year ago in Spain, the leader of the Popular Party, Mr Rajoy, expressed his support in the Spanish Parliament for a specific amendment to our constitution. Moreover just last week, the Spanish Parliament and Senate reached an agreement on the matter, after Prime Minister Zapatero gave his formal support. The commitment to cleaning up public accounts cannot be an interim measure, ladies and gentlemen; it has to be permanent. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
),

 This report on audit policy, as its title states, aims to analyse lessons from the crisis. Given that one of the causes of that crisis was a loss of trust, which is the most important value for developed economies, with this resolution the European Parliament is proposing to strengthen that trust by means of auditing companies. This report is the result of a convergence of opinions; these may have been divided at the outset, but they have succeeded in establishing clear rules to strengthen the role of auditors. Nevertheless, instead of changing the market structure by penalising some of the major companies, the decision was taken to guarantee free competition and give greater support to small and medium-sized enterprises so that they can establish themselves in the market. On that point, may I congratulate Mr Masip Hidalgo for the work he has carried out in the Committee on Legal Affairs. This is an ambitious report that is going to require considerable development in order to accommodate everything that has been suggested. There were many lessons to be learned from the crisis, and this is a clear example of Europe’s will to draw the necessary impetus from the crisis in order to implement the mechanisms able to restore faith in the global economy. Audit policy is one of those. Luis de Grandes Pascual,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is an honour to defend this own-initiative report. While it was initially intended that it would be limited to security scanners, the recent increase in terrorist activity demanded that the report go further. As a result, the Committee on Transport and Tourism unanimously agreed to make me the rapporteur so as to ensure that the report would take an integral view of civil aviation security. In keeping with that mandate, the report assesses security scanners, the decisions adopted regarding liquids, aerosols and gels, and security measures on cargo and mail. Transport security, ladies and gentlemen, is one of the main concerns in the fight against terrorism. Currently, Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 describes the different aspects which are included in the points of this report. In the area of security scanners: as is set out in the explanatory statement, this report derives from the Commission’s 2008 draft regulation. This proposal, if you recall, was rejected by Parliament for not demonstrating that it fulfilled a series of requirements such as respect for fundamental rights, safeguarding health and protecting passenger data. Therefore, the Commission has resolved, and I hope it will continue to do so, all the doubts that Parliament raised and which I have identified and dealt with in this report. With regard to the protection of fundamental rights, the new-generation security scanners comply with all the necessary requirements: human dignity, respect for privacy, non-discrimination and the guarantee of a high level of protection of human health in the definition and exercise of all European Union policies and actions, all of which are included in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. The systems in place are not usually those presented in the news or newspapers by critics of security scanners. The proposed systems do not show the human body, but rather a stick figure, a mannequin, a photograph of the fully-clothed passenger or simply an ‘OK’ in green when the passenger passes through without activating the alarm. In the area of data protection: data protection is an issue that is also under constant review, and is guaranteed by new scanner technology. This makes it possible for data to be automatically destroyed once the purpose for which it is collected has been achieved. With regard to body images, ladies and gentlemen: no body images will be produced. This is one of the basic points on which the vast majority agreed, without doubt because it affects privacy as a fundamental right that cannot be eroded. In the area of public health protection: the maximum guarantee has been given by Parliament. Ionising radiation, because of its harmful effects, whether through cumulative or long-term effects, has been made obsolete by another type of technology that does not affect passenger health. Therefore, Parliament is sending a clear message and saying ‘no’ to the use of X-rays. To summarise, ladies and gentlemen, security scanners are not perfect but they are, without doubt, more effective than simple metal detectors. They bring added value and can detect dangerous objects and items that conventional scanners cannot detect. They are a tool providing measures that are proportional to the risk they are trying to prevent. They will be optional and not compulsory for Member States, but those States that do introduce them should implement harmonised, minimum standards for everyone. They will not be compulsory for travellers, but those who refuse to use them will be obliged to submit to alternative procedures which are at least as effective as the security scanners. With regard to liquids: I am not going to refer to them as there will be a debate with the Commissioner, and two objectives have already been set: there is the unfulfilled objective of 29 April 2011, on which we are awaiting reports, and the guarantee that this will be met in 2013. The European Civil Aviation Conference guarantees that technology exists which is capable of detecting liquid explosives. Therefore, this report reaffirms that Parliament’s mandate must be implemented if everything is ready. It is clear that the first objective has not been met and, therefore, as I have already said and I repeat, we are awaiting the Commissioner’s comments. In the area of cargo and mail: the recent attacks carried out on passenger planes have led the European Union to develop a more ambitious plan and to act quickly to identify additional necessary measures. I support the idea that security and screening systems have to be proportional and equivalent. Goods transported on planes must be screened, particularly if 70% of cargo is transported on passenger planes. In this regard, I welcome the support of all the groups for raising the level of cargo security, as I proposed. To conclude, Mr President, all of the issues which are included in this report on aviation security are a response to previous terrorist acts, which is why, over the coming years, the European Union will endeavour to establish a security system that prevents and avoids future attacks. I particularly wish to thank all those who worked together to enable a very difficult and complex issue, which was initially rejected by Parliament, to reach this plenary session today – thanks to the Commission’s new attitude and the flexibility shown by the political groups – with widespread support and broad consensus. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his cooperation and dialogue. The Commission called on Parliament, and the Commission will take up the relay. The next steps are the Commission’s responsibility. We await the Commissioner’s comments. Luis de Grandes Pascual,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, this time I will try to be brief and comply with your instructions. Commissioner, thank you very much for your attitude and for being receptive to Parliament’s report. We may presume from what you have said that you value and take on board many of our assessments. I say ‘our’ because this report is not only mine; rather it brings together a broad consensus, and that is positive. I would add that I am going to try to maintain that consensus up to the very last minute. Mrs Lichtenberger, we are going to accept your second amendment, because I believe it is beneficial to the area of training. With regard to your first amendment, I will try to ensure you do not have the same reservations over the issue of the name given to the scanners, because nobody gets them confused. I know that you mean well, but I would be grateful if you could withdraw the amendment. If not, then you are within your rights and I shall respect that, of course. With regard to the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I believe it will be necessary to look at them in greater detail; I very much regret that I do not agree with the principles of your amendments. These amendments are not fundamental, and I sincerely believe that there is an underlying intention to vote against them, which I regret. In any case, I would say earnestly to Mr Hénin, and I am sorry he is not here, that in a democratic society there are no grounds that legitimise any terrorist action. No political cause nor apolitical cause: terrorism must be flatly rejected in a democratic society. With regard to the amendments tabled by the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, and I am sorry that Mrs Foster is not here, for she is always very kind, I believe these are unnecessary because what they are seeking to achieve in the area of profiling could cause confusion. In paragraph 4, which we are also going to improve with an amendment put forward by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament so as to elaborate on the strengthening of data protection, it is not necessary to talk about profiling as that could cause confusion and give an impression of discrimination, and I am sure that no attempt will be made to do so. We are going to accept, not just accept for consideration, the S&amp;D Group’s oral amendment, because I believe it is good and, if Parliament accepts it, we will vote in favour of it. As far as the rest is concerned, I believe that we are going to truly fulfil the mandate given to us. Commissioner, I believe we have done well so far; we have passed the baton on to you and I hope you will rise to the occasion. I am sure you will, as you have shown talent and courage, and I am grateful that you are sorry about what happened on 29 April 2011. I know you are being sincere, and I hope that in 2013 we will fulfil all the objectives in the area of liquids, as we are all trying to do. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 Mr President, it is no coincidence that Spain, Italy, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and other countries are all reluctant to accept the so-called Eurovignette. This common critical stance stems from our position as peripheral countries since, at the end of the day, it will be us who will pay this quite singular levy and the Member States enjoying a geographical location in the centre of the European Union who will collect it. The reasoning that underlies the Eurovignette is beset by major contradictions and the discourse that supports it becomes weaker every day. Even accepting the rationality of internalising external costs as a valid starting point, it is ultimately untenable to penalise heavy goods vehicles only and not ordinary cars with the aim of mitigating traffic congestion, just as the old ‘polluter pays’ principle is applied in a clearly discriminatory way. In addition to this, ladies and gentlemen, only 15% of the funds collected through the Eurovignette – which was conceived as a funding source for infrastructures – will finally be used to fund trans-European networks, and not as a requirement but merely as a recommendation. Thus, finance ministries will allocate the funds as they see fit according to the interests of their countries, within the wide sphere of infrastructures. The ultimate result will be yet another setback for road freight transport, which, the way things stand today, is the only means enabling the operation of the Internal Market. This is reality, ladies and gentlemen, a reality that is a lot starker in the context of an economic crisis. If European products are to be competitive in global markets, we cannot afford experiments that may result in even further damage to an already weak European economy by imposing yet more additional costs. Lastly, the food crisis, which has recklessly been blamed on Spanish products, has led to unfair penalties and huge losses for those penalised by the Eurovignette: freight carriers and prime crop farmers. It is for all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, that the Spanish delegation of the European People’s Party shall vote against this draft directive. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Madam President, recently, the Church of Our Lady of Salvation in Baghdad was attacked and 58 people were killed, mainly women and children, purely because they were Christians. Al-Qaeda has proudly claimed responsibility for this deed. This is not an isolated incident, but rather the culmination of persecutions of and attacks on Christians in majority Muslim countries. There have been expulsions from Morocco, threats in Turkey and attacks in India and Nigeria. In January, six Christians were massacred at the door of a church in Cairo. For how long will Western democracies collude with this by remaining silent? Fortunately, President Buzek has made a statement on behalf of Parliament. The statement by the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, condemning the attack, limited itself to condemning a terrorist act. Why is the motive not mentioned, in other words, the fact that they were Christians, which was the unequivocal reason behind the attack? I have not heard anything from Mr Zapatero, nor have I heard anything from Prime Minister Erdogan. What is the point of the Alliance of Civilisations? I am ashamed of our simple-mindedness and cowardice. I cannot help recalling the late, misunderstood Oriana Fallaci, who announced the arrival of Eurabia
 and was practically stoned for having the courage to condemn what was happening in this neurotic Europe. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, must be congratulated. We have had dissimilar, even conflictive positions, but she has found compromise solutions that allow us to stand together today on this important issue. Ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided that all the seas should be protected in a similar way, arguing that any other solution would bring about a situation of unfair competition. We accept the position of the majority in favour of a legal situation with uniform rules for the entire Union, although I will not spare Members the fact that such a solution also clearly implies a certain degree of unfairness. It is obvious that the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel are more polluted and, in my view, sulphur monitoring will have to be stricter. The measures to reduce transport time and handling costs in ports are certainly positive initiatives. Nonetheless, I will repeat this again and again: we still have work to do on this matter. Unless we liberalise our ports resolutely, they will not be able to expand the key role they will be required to play in the context of co-modality. The promotion of a CO2
 reduction strategy aimed at altering the specific consequences of climate change is also to be welcomed. I think this is a good report that must be adopted. But we must not forget that this report is in the context of a serious disaster, namely that affecting the Gulf of Mexico. In this respect, the Commission is urged to judge whether it is necessary, within the framework of revision of the Regulation of the European Maritime Safety Agency, to strengthen the role of the Agency in carrying out preventive inspections and post-hydrocarbon-spill clean-up tasks. Commissioner, this, I believe, is a necessary reform and the necessary mandate must be used to support these tasks. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mrs De Veyrac on her report, which has enabled an agreement to be reached at first reading. I must, however, make three critical observations that imply the need to make concessions whenever there are negotiations of this type. Firstly, the individual identification of victims has been dropped: when DNA allows such identification to take place, it is natural for families to demand that they be given not just any bodies but the bodies of the victims to whom they are related. Secondly, the term ‘causes’ has not been replaced by ‘concurrent factors’. This is going to be a source of litigation, and I believe it is a serious error – and if not, time will tell – as the technical investigation needs to be separated from the legal investigation. Finally, we find it deeply regrettable that the Spanish delegation may ultimately have to abstain, regardless of its favourable opinion on the subject. This is, quite simply, because the relationship with Gibraltar Airport, which is now governed by the Ministerial Statement agreed in Cordoba in 2006, has been mentioned since 1987. Previously, the legislation was suspended and reference was made to the differences between the United Kingdom and Spain, and now three references are made to those legal differences, and nothing more. This, of course, means that we will have to abstain, regardless– I repeat – of our favourable opinion of the report and of the work done by Mrs De Veyrac. Once again, I would like to praise her for a good report that will be fundamentally positive. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, I would have liked to have made a different speech today, believe me. You set out six months full of ambition, and set the bar so high with your claims that, when these are compared with what was actually achieved, disappointment was inevitable. What is certain is that you have not been able to overcome a complex situation for which you lacked leadership and credibility. You yourself pointed out once that the European Union is a club with rules and I agree. However, it was up to you to demand obedience to these rules. The reality is that it was the government of Spain that urgently needed to fulfil its obligations. Within this context, positive achievements, whilst not lacking, have been undistinguished. Unlike me, you have had time to talk about them. Democracy is a public opinion-based system. This is how it seems: President Obama’s disdain, as well as the cancellation of the Mediterranean Summit and the one announced between the European Union and the United States, constitute very significant failures. The rush to reach improvised agreements at any cost has not helped the image of Spanish management: as a way of achieving a respectable objective, it could be described as amateurish. Spain is a great nation, and will continue to be one, despite the poor management of this period. Our diplomats and officials have kept a stiff upper lip and, thanks to this, Spain’s prestige will survive. The truth is that the situation in Spain will count for more within the value judgment that will be made of this Presidency than what was done or not done here. Someone who has taken his country into a phase of uncertainty and unrest would have difficulty in providing leadership for an enterprise this difficult. At best, this Presidency has been sadly irrelevant. Luis de Grandes Pascual,

Mr President, Mr Kallas, this is a directive that affects all customs formalities that apply to ships arriving in or departing from ports. Thus, it will favour short-distance maritime transport and will contribute to modal balance. The aim, ladies and gentlemen, is to reduce and simplify the amount of information and number of documentation and physical controls carried out by ships with respect to goods. At present, this information must be provided and these controls carried out repeatedly. The attitude of the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, who I would like to congratulate for his work, has been intelligent and open to dialogue. Particularly, as a shadow rapporteur, I feel represented in the final document and satisfied that my contributions have been taken on board. This is a process that has grown with time, during the course of which agreements were gradually reached, ranging from its adoption by the Committee on Transport and Tourism to the trialogue held on 7 June. The end result has been the consensus reached between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The agreements have covered some very important issues, to which the rapporteur and Commissioner Kallas have already referred. In my opinion, the compromise solutions reached with respect to the issue of the languages used, the time limit for its entry into force, and the one-stop shop, are balanced and worthy of support. I think a good job has been done. I would like to congratulate Mr Sterckx and believe the goals set for us by the Commission have been fully met. Moreover, I feel that we should be pleased about having reached this agreement between the three parties, the three institutions. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 Mr President, in my opinion, this excellent report sets out the guidelines that must inspire the new White Paper on Transport that will shape European transport policy for the next 10 years. This report includes several issues that are worth outlining: the need for a financial fund as an essential instrument; the challenge of the growing demands of freight transport; the search for comodal solutions that make users and freight safe; the vital need for sufficient and secure rest areas for road transport; the – in my opinion, correct – diagnosis that the various modes of transport must complement each other, with efficiency criteria being sought rather than merely being in competition with each other; and the rapporteur’s – brave, in my opinion, and fair – assertion that transport by rail or sea is not always more environmentally friendly than road transport. In short, the concept of ‘efficient comodality’ is a concept for the future and it must certainly, in my opinion, be given full support. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Kallas for being here and for the work that he has done during this difficult time. This is a debate that had to take place, ladies and gentlemen, and unfortunately, I think it will not be the last of its kind. I will spare you any repeats of the statistics of this serious event and the negative impact that it has had on the economy. I simply wish to remember those who were affected. Firstly, there were the passengers. Ten million people were left without flights and with no guidance as to what to do. The impact on passengers was so great that the provisions of directives and regulations could not protect them. The exclusion of liability in contracts due to catastrophe or force majeure
 brings to mind the need for a joint fund to tackle the consequences of a global disaster such as that caused by the volcano. I now come to the airlines. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that they lost EUR 1 700 million worldwide. The Association of European Airlines (AEA) assesses the loss at EUR 850 million at European level. This blow was all that they needed to accentuate a spiralling crisis that is threatening many airlines with closure. The other victim has been tourism. The consequences for tourism have been devastating. Firstly, due to the cancellation of contracts that had been made in advance, as is usual in this sector, and secondly, due to insecurity, which has caused a change in normal booking trends. This is my diagnosis, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. There can only be one conclusion: the European institutions do not have the tools to effectively tackle a crisis of this magnitude. Now I come to the criticism, because criticism is necessary and inevitable; self-criticism, if necessary. No one can be exonerated, because everyone involved acted badly, late and inefficiently, sometimes through no fault of their own. The Member States cannot be exonerated because, although the decisions were within their competence, they were still unable to act. The European institutions cannot be exonerated because they took four long days to react, and because their reaction, which invoked safety as their priority, did not unfortunately produce calm, but paralysis. I will now discuss the Commission’s response. Today, the Commission is reiterating the measures that it had announced to us. In my view, they are reasonable measures, but there is a lack of clarity about the timescale for implementing them. We are not talking about something in the past. Even today, there is a latent threat of flights being grounded, and it is concerning that we are dependent on air currents. I know that we cannot fight the elements. This was said by a famous Spanish sailor regarding a big naval battle that we lost. The crisis will not help us to take measures. The Member States will be reluctant to provide resources. If we are mean, however, this volcano could do more damage to the European economy than is being forecast. I ask the Commission to be determined, and I ask the Council to urgently tackle the need to take decisions. I ask everyone to be generous in implementing alternatives to make up for the incapacities of the institutions. I do not hold the Commission or the Council responsible, but we need to acknowledge the diagnosis that the institutions have not been capable, as they currently stand, of solving a crisis of this magnitude and proportions.

 Mr Zapatero, for a Spaniard, such as I am, it is an honour to greet you here, as you take your turn as the President of the European Union. This is a period of many expectations and challenges and, of course, we must not fail to live up to those expectations. It is important that our citizens see that our updated institutions are capable of providing solutions to real problems. You know that we agree with the programme you have put forward. You know that, for the Spanish Partido Popular
, this is a question of state and that we will be behind you in everything that we regard as being in the common interests of Europe and that is important to Spain. It is an ambitious programme and, hopefully, a programme full of content. I hope that in this album of the Spanish Presidency – since it will surely be colourful and varied – people can see every event as a milestone in the very real problems that affect them. The crisis is hitting economies and unemployment seems like the fifth horse of the Apocalypse. You have had the honesty to recognise that there is 20% unemployment in Spain, but that does not curtail you. I believe that it obliges us all to come up with a solution to a problem that we must solve together. It is a real problem. The time available does not allow me to say too much, Prime Minister. However, I do want to tell you that Spain faces many challenges ahead, that I am certain of Spain’s capability as a nation and that I want to believe and am sure that you will rise to the challenge. At this time in Europe, we must not fail to live up to these expectations On the other hand, the globalised world – and you have referred to it with intelligence – means that new centres of power are emerging and it is necessary for the European Union to take a more active and coherent role in defence of its values and interests. Otherwise, we run the risk of becoming irrelevant. Finally, Prime Minister, we Spanish will not accept being denied the ability to make proposals. We have that right. We must also have the humility to accept the advice that Don Quixote gave to Sancho Panza when he recommended humility in his fantasy about governing the Isle of Barataria.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain has just endured a painful situation in which a vessel, the Alakrana,
 and all its crew were subjected to blackmail, humiliation and countless risks. The Spanish Government is being called to account in Spain, as is appropriate in the case. In this House, we are going to talk of Europe and more Europe. Accordingly, it has to be stated that after a year in which we have demanded diplomacy and determination, the outcome has been positive. Operation Atalanta is inadequate, however. It needs to be broadened and made more flexible. It has to become possible to protect not only the routes along which humanitarian aid moves, but also Community fishing and merchant vessels. The latter must be protected, and that is why, in the resolution to be adopted tomorrow, we shall call on the European Parliament and on its institutions to make certain commitments. What we are seeking to do is to say ‘yes’ to the strong stance taken by states that protect their vessels with their armed forces to deter and, if necessary, legally repel pirate action. We must say ‘no’ to recourse to private security contractors, a move which, according to the IMO, carries with it the risk of unnecessary violence. We must say ‘no’ to the passive and dilettante attitude of governments that are making life easy for the pirates. We must say ‘yes’, however, to diplomacy, ‘yes’ to aid to Somalia, and ‘no’ to unsubstantiated charges of alleged illegal fishing. Community vessels are fishing in compliance with our international agreements. They are doing so legally and must be protected. The Community's institutions are duty bound to do so.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank you for being here this morning and also congratulate you on the good job you have done with the publication of the Single Market Act II. I would also like to applaud the work of Ms Bastos, which is correct and certainly necessary. I believe that the 12 proposals included in the act will surely constitute a major boost to the single market, and I especially welcome the inclusion of the creation of a genuine digital single market among those priorities. This year we are celebrating 20 years of the single market: 20 years of prosperity during which as Europeans we have expanded the opportunities available to our businesses and to the public. However, if we want to continue making progress and to be able to meet the forthcoming challenges of technological changes and developments, and ensure that our economy continues to be competitive in the global market, I firmly believe that, just as in the 1980s and 1990s we developed and established the four fundamental freedoms, now the main goal we must achieve is to create a true, genuine digital single market. I know, Commissioner, due to our close cooperation over the last two years, that the digital market is a priority for you. I would like to take this opportunity to once again offer my support so that we may continue the same cooperation between the Commission and Parliament that we have had so far in order to make the digital single market a reality. Exactly two weeks ago the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the report on completing the Digital Single Market by a very large majority. I believe it is vital that both Parliament and the Commission convey to the Council the need to move forward with the recommendations in both documents and that we continue to work very closely in order to put them into effect. Pablo Arias Echeverría  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the three Commissioners for being here today. We are experiencing a crisis that can only be overcome by reviving trade. There is no doubt that SMEs are the pillar underpinning the European economy and there is no doubt that we need more Europe and less market fragmentation. The digital revolution offers us many possibilities, and one of these is, without any doubt, electronic commerce. An increasing number of consumers buy online, but they only do so at a national level – things are more complicated at a European level. Market barriers do not help, and electronic commerce is almost non-existent at this pan-European level. In my opinion, and I have said this several times, the way out of the crisis is digital, and the time has come to go from poetry to prose. It is time for action. Our SMEs need concrete measures to increase their pan-European options and to develop their full potential in a market of more than 500 million consumers. Consumers, meanwhile, need a pan-European market that offers sufficient guarantees to allow them to trust in a true digital single market, in which they can buy products in the knowledge that their rights are assured, with freedom of choice and at a good price. The Consumer Rights Directive is a good first step. I would like to know what next steps the Commission has in mind with regard to copyright, data protection, VAT, accounting rules, a single domain for online transactions, conflict resolution, product shipping, etc. Pablo Arias Echeverría  (PPE
).

 Madam President, I would just like to say a word about the Working Group on e-Commerce. Thank you very much for your answer, Commissioner. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) has a Working Group on e-Commerce, and we would like you to take part in this so that we can discuss these proposals in greater depth and find out about the specific measures, enabling the IMCO Committee to gain a proper understanding of them. Pablo Arias Echeverría  (PPE
).

Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the communication that you have presented to us. I think it is a good initiative in order to continue working to improve the single European market. I consider it vital that the 50 proposals that you referred to in your speech be debated. I hope that in Parliament, I will be able to play an active role in helping to overcome barriers to e-commerce in Europe. Many of the current barriers to e-commerce have already been detected, and there are even specific proposals for overcoming them. We could say that we are reliant on political will to resolve those barriers. I think that this communication is a good start, and I therefore think we should support it by playing an active role. Pablo Arias Echeverría,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, as you all know, the Internet and new technologies represent an unprecedented revolution that means that we need to modernise the mechanisms that regulate e-commerce in our economy in order to be able to tackle the challenges that we are facing. Just a few years ago, the new systems for trade over the Internet, and the new technologies and opportunities we have available to us now, did not exist. They are now a fact, however, and soon they will be an essential tool. As legislators, we need to be broad-minded enough to create tools for the public that solve the problems of today, but which foresee and can be adapted to the problems of tomorrow. This is a commitment that we must make and a responsibility that we are obliged to take on. We must prepare the way for what is to come and for those who are to come, and this means we need to overcome the obstacles to achieving that goal. E-commerce is a tool available to us with enormous potential for relaunching and improving the competitiveness of our economy and also for strengthening the internal market. It is a tool that can create a great deal of added value and offer great opportunities to the European people and businesses in this time of crisis. It is vital that the leaders of the European Union implement the necessary measures to overcome the existing barriers to cross-border e-commerce in Europe and that we generate confidence in this medium, simplify it and make the rules governing it transparent. That is the only way to ensure that the public and businesses will be able to reap the rewards of its enormous potential. That is the only way that we can be competitive in a global market that waits for no one. Either we take the necessary measures energetically, decisively and with leadership, or our competitors will leave us behind. The report that I am presenting today proposes measures for overcoming the barriers to cross-border trade. We have the opportunity not only to prepare the internal market for e-commerce, but also to help to complement the internal market through e-commerce. The measures that I propose in the report are aimed at improving the quality of access to the Internet in Europe, improving consumer confidence by creating a European quality mark, increasing monitoring and supervision of the network and conducting information campaigns so that users are aware of their rights and know how and where to complain if they have problems. They are also aimed at protecting the private property and personal data of users, promoting the development of initiatives that incentivise businesses to sell their products online, improving payment systems and simplifying the rules regarding the payment of taxes, among other measures. Finally, in this plan, I felt I needed to highlight the need to improve protection for minors using the Internet. I believe that all these measures are essential for promoting e-commerce and for adapting the rules that currently govern it to a future in which we are already living. We have an obligation to offer mechanisms to the market that make our businesses more competitive and strengthen our economies. This plan is undoubtedly a platform on which we can continue to build without any obstacles or hindrances. For these reasons, I would like to ask this House for its support to move forward with this initiative. Pablo Arias Echeverría  (PPE

Mr President, we have just voted on paragraph 44, and although my vote was in favour, I put down ‘against’ because there was some slight confusion: we were told that we were voting on 45, when in reality we were voting on 44. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

(ES) 
Mr President, we all recognise the importance of this report and the efforts made by the rapporteur to achieve a consensus, and I would therefore firstly like to congratulate Ms Thyssen. This House has called on previous occasions for the establishment of an integrated financial framework, budgetary framework and economic policy framework. At the Council in June the guidelines and roadmap were agreed, which we must now begin to follow. It is now the time to do what was agreed. The first step is banking union based on three pillars. Firstly, a single supervisor, which is the key to breaking the circle between banking debt and sovereign debt; a second pillar based on the common deposit guarantee mechanism; and a third pillar based on a common bank crisis resolution system. These are three basic pillars in order finally to begin to generate stability and confidence. In this sense, I support the European Central Bank taking on as soon as possible the powers to act as single independent supervisor over all banks, obviously with the cooperation of the national authorities. With regard to direct recapitalisation of banks, I support what was adopted at the Council in June, in which the possibility was confirmed of a direct injection of cash into the banks once the single supervisor begins operation. In addition, fiscal union is the other goal that must be achieved in the medium term, in order to achieve an authentic and genuine economic and monetary union. In the same way, as a culmination of this whole process, we should move towards some sort of mutualisation of debt, in order to put an end once and for all to the differences in interest rates due to the doubts generated regarding the euro area. What is most important in all of this is what I said at the start: to do what we have agreed, therefore I reiterate my full support for the rapporteur. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am addressing the House with the simple aim of highlighting the importance of the European Semester as a tool for detecting the weaknesses in our system and for exercising the democratic legitimacy that Parliament represents. Following the beginning of the crisis, and thanks to the implementation of these mechanisms, we are succeeding in analysing its causes in order to lay the foundations for greater EU integration, which is the only response and the only option for bringing an end to the crisis and ensuring that this type of crisis cannot happen again. The semester represents the desire for coordination that we have been so much lacking so far in order to jointly manage our needs as Europeans. The tools related to the European Semester, the Annual Growth Survey and the Country-Specific Recommendations create greater stability for all Member States and deepen their knowledge. The report, presented by Mr Gauzès, which is the result of very hard work, reflects their value. Nevertheless, we must continue to promote greater coordination between our policies until we create not only true economic union, but true political union. This does not mean that agreements do not have to be fulfilled, but must be a further incentive for the EU to speak with once voice. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by underlining my support for free trade agreements as a fundamental means of stimulating the much-longed-for and much-needed economic growth and the creation of jobs. These agreements also boost relations with our allies, in this instance Japan.  The former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama recently stated in an article in the Wall Street Journal
 that both Brussels and Tokyo had strong ties with Washington, but that the ties between Brussels and Tokyo were not so strong. I agree with him that this agreement could be an opportunity to redress this imbalance.  Nevertheless, at a time when we are considering launching negotiations to conclude a free trade agreement with Japan, I believe that the European Union’s trade strategy should be in keeping with its industrial strategy and I would like to know the Commissioner’s opinion on this point.  In addition, if we want industry’s share of GDP to rise from the current 16 % to 20 %, as proposed in the Europe 2020 agenda, it would make sense, in my opinion, to listen to the concerns of industry itself when it comes to trade policy. The automotive industry is undoubtedly of key importance in this respect. We should therefore listen to its concerns and work with it to ensure that this agreement becomes a reality as soon as possible. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, firstly, I believe it is appropriate to congratulate Commissioner Barnier on his hard work and the great passion he is putting into this project. We are again faced with a decisive moment for the euro. There can be no more delays. We have to progress towards true economic and monetary union, and ultimately, true political union. There is no going back. We will all agree that banking union is the first basic and essential step towards political union. There are three main pillars of this banking union. The first is a single supervisory authority, which supervises all banks in the euro area, and it is even more important that it comes into force as soon as possible. The second is a common deposit guarantee fund. The third is a banking crisis management mechanism. We also need the option to be able to directly recapitalise banks when required, to break, as mentioned by Commissioner Barnier, the vicious circle between banking debt and sovereign debt, and to finally overcome the debt crisis. This is the real deal. There is no going back on the euro. The Spanish Government has made a proposal, an ambitious proposal, in this respect. This was born out of the Spanish Government’s commitment to Europe and the euro. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the expected adoption of the amendments to the safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas is a key step towards Parliament adopting the two agreements with Central America, Colombia and Peru. Those agreements are essential for the future of the European Union. These clauses, along with the progress made by Colombia, acknowledged by the political resolution adopted by this House on 13 June, as well as the support of the Central American countries and Peru for this regulation, should provide the final approval for the ratification of those agreements. These clauses will allow our producers to progressively adapt to a free-trade framework that will benefit us all. At a time when the United States and Asian countries are signing free-trade agreements with American countries, such as the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) or the agreements between the United States and Colombia and Peru, respectively, we cannot allow the leading trading power in the world, the European Union, to continue to miss opportunities. In this sense, I share the concern of the European business sector at the delay in these agreements coming into force. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, almost all of us agree that the way to exit the crisis is through austerity and reforms to instigate growth. We should not fall into the false debate of austerity versus growth: austerity is a key tool and required in order to achieve the goal of economic growth. In this respect, Spain is an example, an example of a country committed to fiscal consolidation and reforms. To achieve this, Europe must focus on the formation of fiscal policy measures that will ensure austerity as well as growth and job creation, but the European Central Bank needs, more than ever, to instigate a monetary policy that allows for the acceleration of the effects of the implemented structural reforms. The ‘policy mix’ is of key importance, today more than ever. There is a need to underpin the adopted fiscal measures with a more relaxed monetary policy that means that the aforementioned measures and reforms have the quickest possible effect: over 20 million unemployed people in Europe are waiting.

 Mr Romeva, the Spanish Government has not rejected any investment in the manner you mentioned, neither is the Spanish Government against the eurobonds.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank both the European Commission and the governments of Colombia and Peru for the great efforts made to successfully reach this agreement. I give my full support to an agreement that will undoubtedly benefit both regions, both Colombia and Peru, and will help to improve human rights conditions in Colombia. This agreement is an example for a key region for the European Union, as is South America. I am concerned about another agreement, however, one that the Commission is about to start negotiating. The Commission should show that it roundly defends the legal security of the investments that are made, which are so important in improving trade flow between both parties. I would like to take this opportunity, therefore, to ask Commissioner De Gucht about the measures being considered when it comes to the Repsol YPF issue. As has been the case with the agreement with Colombia and Peru which we are debating here, the best guarantee to reach a possible successful agreement with Mercosur would be a strong and decisive response from the European Union when it comes to the Repsol case. We should not allow our allies on the other side of the Atlantic to be more robust than we are when it comes to an issue that affects Europe. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,

 Mr President, Mr Šemeta, the last European Council meeting focused on the need to improve the taxation system in order to improve tax collection efficiency and put a stop to tax evasion and tax fraud. Spain will introduce a law on this matter. The ideas that have been put forward by the Council and given expression in this resolution are priorities of Spain’s economic policy and, I am certain, that of the rest of Europe as well. They will enable us to bring about legal certainty, reduce the informal economy and lower the number of people who are not fulfilling their tax obligations; this will be sure to create a fairer Europe. Furthermore, we should bear in mind the recommendations made by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the principle of trying to eliminate or reduce to a minimum the comparative disadvantage between those who have fulfilled their taxation obligations and those who do not fulfil them. The resolution we shall vote on in plenary and the Spanish plan to prevent and combat tax fraud therefore seek to fight against the informal economy, promote transparency and European coordination, boost tax collection – enabling the deficit to be reduced, which is so badly needed at the moment – and not damage opportunities for growth but, on the contrary, create a fairer and more efficient system that reflects those opportunities. Those decisions will have a very positive impact on the public accounts and, I insist, will make a significant contribution to reducing the deficit and, therefore, to restoring growth. Finally, while we are talking about growth, I want to take this opportunity to stress that, in order to achieve the growth we so badly want, we should continue to pledge our commitment to internationalising our economy and our businesses, as the Council has stated many times. To achieve that, however, we need to guarantee the legal certainty of our investments, but I do not want to speak ahead of the debate we shall have later.

 Mr President, firstly, Ms Muñiz, the Spanish Government has not passed any tax amnesty laws because, as you are aware, that concept is not included in the Spanish constitution. It is true that the Spanish Government has proposed regularisation, as other countries such as Belgium and Germany have done, as well as other Spanish governments of your own political affiliation – that is, the Socialist Party, a few years ago.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my third speech in the House so far this year on this issue and I am sorry to stick to the same refrain but, as my fellow countryman, Miguel de Unamuno, used to say: ‘to strike the nail once, you must strike the horseshoe a hundred times’. Furthermore, I want to repeat the call to actively implement the measures that have been agreed in the last few Councils. As the President of the Commission has said, we need to finish the job. We need growth, ladies and gentlemen. With austerity, we will manage to create stability and confidence, but we also have to emerge from the crisis and create work and well-being once more. We need to commit to urgent implementation of the measures that were agreed upon in the last few Councils to incentivise growth. These measures must be accompanied by reforms. Spain is clearly committed to this spirit of reform. In less than 100 days, we have passed three key reforms: budgetary stability, financial reform and labour reform and this spirit of reform does not end here. As Mariano Rajoy says, the Spanish Government not only announces reforms, it carries them out, which is a different thing altogether. Let us follow its example. Let us not announce plans for growth, let us implement them. Furthermore, we need a degree of adaptability to circumstances given that we live in a world of constant change and evolution. As the President of the government of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, said recently before the House and as the Economy Minister, Luis de Guindos confirmed today, Spain is fulfilling its duties and will continue to do so. Spain is more committed than ever to Europe. It has demonstrated this right from the start, putting its cards on the table and standing by its desire to comply with what has been agreed.

 Mr President, Commissioner, after the Council meetings held recently, Adenauer’s statement that ‘we all live under the same sky, but we do not all have the same horizon’, appears to be losing clout in favour of the construction of this common area, the European Union. The most important issue remains, however, in that we should actively implement all the measures agreed during recent Council meetings. Up to now, the austerity measures appear to have been applied most speedily. I will insist as many times as is necessary in this plenary, however, that we are not getting anywhere by only applying austerity; we need growth. These tough but essential adjustment programmes have to go hand in hand with the necessary reforms to generate growth and employment. Up to now, Spain has been at the forefront of this comprehensive austerity and reform plan. The three major reforms that were approved – ‘budgetary stability’, ‘reform of the financial system’ and ‘labour reform’ – testify to that. These reforms have merited the acknowledgement of different governments and media, despite the obstacles being placed in their way by launching unfounded rumours. The latter began with sport and yesterday threatened to spread into our economy and our politics. Let us continue to work for the same horizon. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, congratulations on your appointment. Prime Minister, we are celebrating the decisions adopted during the last Council, but it is my hope and wish that they do not remain mere words, but that they also become actions and come to fruition as soon as possible. We must send a solid message to the markets. Up to now, they have been very welcoming of the measures. Furthermore, there is a sense of eagerness for cooperation and a spirit of willingness, both of which we will continue to have great need of over the coming months. We must maintain and continue to consolidate our efforts in favour of stability and continue to put our trust in austerity measures, but these must be accompanied by other measures to generate growth and, therefore, employment. We cannot recover from this crisis through austerity measures alone. We need to bring reforms to fruition, not just debate them. Spain is showing that it is fully committed to this idea. That is why we are supporting the structural reforms that must be implemented by the Member States. The European Central Bank, for its part, has demonstrated courage when taking decisions, but it must show greater commitment through more active participation in the secondary debt markets. Furthermore, the common financial mechanisms that have been debated at such length in this House must be implemented. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Madam President, this question is for Vice-President Tajani. We all realise how important professional mobility is in building a versatile, competitive workforce. In fact, two of the pillars of the Europe 2020 strategy are innovation and entrepreneurship. Mr Vice-President, as you know, we currently have Erasmus for undergraduates, the Marie Curie programme for researchers and Erasmus for entrepreneurs. I think it would also be necessary to design a programme to provide cross-cutting opportunities to young innovators so that they can carry out their projects not only in universities but also in companies, start-ups, laboratories or government agencies. The members of the European Parliament Youth Intergroup have put forward a proposal to undertake a project entitled ‘Young Innovators Mobility’, which sets out to achieve just that. Mr Vice-President, I would like to know whether this initiative has the Commission’s support. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Madam President, in paragraph 2 of Article 9a, after the words ‘at the request of a Member State’, we would like to add the phrase ‘any legal person or any association not having legal personality acting on behalf of the Union industry’.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner De Gucht, early in this parliamentary term, which is my first, one of the matters I first heard discussed was precisely the Free Trade Agreement with Korea. Certain sectors of European industry, especially the automotive industry, were unanimous in opposing this agreement. As a citizen of Navarre and Spain, where the automotive industry represents a substantial part of our economy, I felt the duty to become involved in order to improve, if not the agreement as this was no longer possible, the safeguard clause, which was where Parliament could introduce improvements. Thus, we set out to achieve two objectives. Firstly, to protect the industry and its jobs, and secondly, to make the agreement more attractive for the industries concerned, particularly the automotive industry. Our aim was not just to avoid outright rejection, but to gain their support for the agreement. I believe that here today, we can say ‘mission accomplished’. This is all thanks to Parliament’s hard work and expertise. I should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteurs of both reports for their outstanding work. Thank you Robert. And thank you also for your words. Recognition is also due to the members of the Committee on International Trade, led by its Chair, Mr Moreira. ¡Muito obrigado!
, Vital. I would also like to thank the Belgian Presidency of the European Union for their excellent work. Their effort has had its reward in the form of the agreement we finally reached in December. Lastly, I would like to highlight the work of the European Commission, and particularly Ignacio Bercero’s contribution, for which I am most grateful. Tomorrow we will vote in favour of a clause which will be more effective, easier to apply and will genuinely protect European industry. Today, concerns on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea have hugely diminished. Indeed, we might say that they have all but vanished. Today, the opportunities this agreement brings clearly outweigh the uncertainties. The European Parliament should be proud of a job well done. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, I would first like to clarify that I am in favour of strengthening trade links between the European Union and Papua New Guinea that promote the development of the region, but it must be sustainable development. I sincerely believe that this agreement, as it currently stands, is not a good one. I am entirely against one clause of the agreement, which I consider to be unfair: the exemption from the rules of origin, because not only does it endanger the sustainable development of Papua New Guinea, but, as we have heard here today, it endangers a whole European industry: the canning industry. This concession should have been absolutely exceptional, and it should not have been applied in the case of Papua New Guinea. Moreover, let us not forget the serious precedent that this measure is setting, and will set, for future European Union negotiations. In my opinion, there needed to be a much clearer and firmer resolution in this respect, stating categorically that, at the next review of the Interim Partnership Agreement, the exemption from the rules of origin will be permanently suspended. I therefore want to ask the Commission to take into account the dramatic consequences that this concession is going to have, firstly, for the European canning industry, and secondly, for the sustainability of the environment and natural resources of Papua New Guinea, and the very negative precedent being set for future negotiations. However much the Commission has said that it will not be a precedent, the pressure will be there. I therefore ask the Commission to decide to put an end to the exemption from the rules of origin as soon as possible. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,

Mr President, the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea will open up opportunities for both European and Korean industry, but in order to prevent any negative effects on European industry, it is essential to have an effective safeguard clause. All the political groups unanimously decided last week that the time had come for Parliament to take a position in plenary on the amendments adopted by 27 votes in favour and just one abstention in the Committee on International Trade in June, which are vital in order for the safeguard clause to be applicable and effective. As you are aware, we are going to vote solely on the amendments and, in accordance with Rule 57, we will defer the vote on the legislative report to the second part-session in October. At the same time, we unanimously decided not to close the door on a possible agreement at first reading, which we firmly believe will be possible. However, in order to do so, it is vitally important that we send a clear signal of unity and strength from all the political groups. That is why it is important for Parliament as a whole to strongly support the whole package of amendments. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Commissioner, President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea will open up opportunities for both European and Korean industry. However, in order to prevent any negative effects on European industry, it is essential to have an effective safeguard clause. That is what my colleagues and I have been working on over the past few months in the Committee on International Trade, which is why it is important for Parliament as a whole to strongly support the whole package of amendments. The report was adopted by 27 votes in favour and one abstention in June. Under this clause, it will be possible to apply safeguard measures if the reductions to the customs duties on products imported from South Korea threaten to cause serious damage to European industry. As you know, under the new powers given to Parliament following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the adoption of this regulation is following the ordinary legislative procedure. Unfortunately, it was not possible to hold a trialogue with a mandate from the Council before the summer recess. The first official trialogue was held on 30 August, and both the shadow rapporteurs and I were able to hear the Council’s reaction to our amendments. That meeting enabled us to move forward on many points and define the final text of some paragraphs, and our feeling following the meeting is that we believe the Council genuinely wants to reach an agreement on the most controversial points and is working hard to do so. This is, of course, something that we view very positively. However, at the same time, we do not think there has been time to sufficiently clarify the Council’s position on the points on which it has a different view to that adopted in the Committee on International Trade. All the political groups therefore unanimously decided that the time had come for Parliament to take a position in plenary on the amendments adopted in the Committee on International Trade in July, which are vital in order for the safeguard clause to be applicable and effective. At the same time, a unanimous decision was taken not to close the door on a possible agreement at first reading, which we firmly believe will be possible when the Council clarifies its position. We will therefore vote tomorrow only on the amendments tabled by the Committee on International Trade and, in accordance with Rule 55, we will defer the vote on the legislative report to the second part-session in October, when we hope to reach a positive conclusion to the legislative procedure. We believe that the report incorporates a whole series of improvements such as creating an on-line platform to speed up the processes; the possibility of the industry being able to initiate an investigation process; the Commission being obliged to produce reports; and improvements in the monitoring and surveillance of Korean imports. These are points on which we have already reached an agreement in principle with the Council. I think this is a good result, but we still do not think it is enough. There are other, even more fundamental points that deserve the full attention of the negotiators and which all the political groups must defend here, as we did in the Committee on International Trade. I am essentially talking about four points. Firstly, we need to mitigate the possible risk to the more vulnerable Member States by establishing a regional clause, region by region, to prevent some sensitive industries from being affected. We should not forget that the safeguard clause is essentially temporary and its objective is precisely to safeguard the most sensitive sectors of the economy so that they have sufficient time to adapt to the new situation. Secondly, we need to clearly establish surveillance for the products affected by the duty drawback clause. Thirdly, we need to defend Parliament’s role in the process of initiating investigations, and the final point is the decision-making process or comitology. As well as mentioning the good will shown by the Belgian Presidency during the negotiations, finally, I want to mention the vital role that the Commission is playing and will continue to play in bringing the negotiations to a sound conclusion.

Madam President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their kind words. Commissioner De Gucht, as we have heard here today, the European Parliament is making its position very clear. As one fellow Member said, this is an historic moment that will set a precedent and this is an historic report that will set a precedent for future agreements. Parliament wants to reach an agreement at first reading and will do everything it can to achieve that. As one of my fellow Members said, this is a key moment for European industry, which needs the new incentives and new markets that this agreement is bound to bring. This is also, however, a delicate time for employment, and we need to guarantee employment in Europe. We also need to guarantee that this agreement does not damage European industry, and in order to do so, we need a strong safeguard clause such as the one adopted by the Committee on International Trade, which will probably be endorsed and strengthened by Parliament’s votes tomorrow. It is therefore now time for the Council and also the Commission to act. The Commission must continue to support us, and we appeal to both institutions to take responsibility. I want to stress that we will seek to reach an agreement at first reading, but we need to get moving. I believe that it is possible, and we await the proposals. Pable Zalba Bidegain,

Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that we must see Latin America as a hugely important trade partner. We believe that negotiations should be reopened for the agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which affects 700 million people and will be the most ambitious bi-regional agreement in the world. We also believe that negotiations concerning the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit, which is to be held in May. We also need to develop the association agreements with Mexico and Chile, which have been a real success. We must therefore express our satisfaction at the conclusion of the free trade agreement with Colombia, which is going to be very beneficial both to Europe and to the Latin American country. We believe that Parliament’s job now is to ratify these agreements in due time and to ensure that no country in the Andean Community that wishes to conclude an agreement is excluded. We, of course, also believe that free trade agreements can and should also be a useful tool for promoting the development of citizens’ rights and freedoms. Lastly, we believe that the path to follow in the future is, on the one hand, to develop the European Union’s agreements with the various countries and regional groups and, on the other, to promote inter-regional integration agreements within Latin America itself. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is very clear as far as the European Union’s trade policy is concerned. We are firm defenders of free trade and it is certainly vital that Europe continues negotiating trade agreements with other countries because they generate new opportunities for European companies, that is to say, new jobs, which are very much required in light of the serious current economic crisis. I did very much like your words Commissioner, because I also believe that it is very important that these agreements contain sufficient guarantees to avoid signing clauses which are unbalanced and unfair for European industry. The agreement with South Korea has been put forward by the Commission as the first in a new generation of more ambitious trade agreements for Europe, hence the importance of this agreement. It is not a question of whether it is a small country or not; it is a question of not weakening our capacity for negotiation in future agreements with much larger countries. Therefore, we are not against the South Korea free trade agreement; however, we do want certain paragraphs to be studied more rigorously, which we believe create unfair competitive disadvantages for certain European industrial sectors and give Korean producers an unfair advantage. Commissioner, I want you to clearly explain to me why the safeguard clause for the duty drawback enters into force in five years. On the last opportunity I had to speak to you, you stated that the reason was that tariffs on vehicles were also dismantled after five years. The agreement stipulates that they will dismantle the tariffs for vehicles which weigh more than five tonnes after five years. However, for vehicles which weigh less than five tonnes, which are all standard vehicles, the 10% tariff will be dismantled in three years. What is the reason for this two-year time lapse Commissioner? I would also like to receive more details regarding any updates on this aspect you mentioned. What is the point of correcting these problems ex post 
when the whole reason for having a safeguard clause is to anticipate possible negative consequences? Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

Mr President, the agreement reached by Parliament and the Council reflects what was unanimously approved by the Member States concerned in the International Maritime Organisation. These seas have disconcerting levels of acidification. Moreover, their capacity for regeneration is very limited. The fuels required are going to be more expensive, and therefore there are plans for financial aid for businesses, which is very reasonable. Some Members, however, have sought to have the requirements for new fuels applied to all the Union’s seas. We would find ourselves with a paradox in that we would be trying to solve an environmental problem of some Member States by creating a major economic problem in the Mediterranean, which does not have that environmental problem, but does have other environmental problems, the costs of which we are not seeking to impose on the other Member States. The Treaty is very clear. Sensitive areas must be protected. However, not all areas are equally sensitive. Pilar Ayuso,

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Ms Auconie for her hard work and efforts to reach a consensus. With regard to the two issues at hand, I must say that I entirely agree with the Commission’s proposal on the electronic identification of beef. However, I cannot say the same for the voluntary beef labelling system. The Commission’s proposal to delete this provision is neither appropriate nor correct. Specifically, this labelling system has played a very important role in restoring European consumers’ confidence in beef and products derived from beef. In my view, the argument being put forward by the Commission regarding a heavy administrative burden is not valid at present, as the operational mechanism is perfectly familiar to the authorities and the sector. Proof that the mechanism is working very well can be found in the fact that in my country, for example, 180 requests for beef labelling have been approved, as opposed to just 32 for goat meat and 55 for poultry and eggs. Voluntary labelling is a highly effective tool for making a distinction between varieties of a product, and consumers want to be informed about what they are buying and consuming. However, consumers do not distinguish between voluntary and mandatory labelling, and they often consider voluntary labelling to be more important and more relevant than mandatory labelling. All of this information combined is what enables them to make informed choices. Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 is by no means perfect, but it is nevertheless much better than the legal vacuum that could be created if Articles 16, 17 and 18 are deleted, because we would be faced with a new system with no prior warning and no mandatory external control. One possible solution to improve the system would be to establish specific sectoral standards for beef, as already exist for other products, such as those in the chicken and poultry sector. I believe the Commission is in the process of doing so. Lastly, I would like to point out that labelling plays a vital role in consumer decision making, and this is precisely what we have defended in Parliament. It is therefore very hard to understand why we should now want to abolish it. Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to draw attention to the excellent work done by Ms McAvan, the rapporteur, and also the other shadow rapporteurs, in order to reach this agreement at first reading. This was very important because the regulation we adopted in 2010 was coming into force and it needed to be amended. It was not amended because it was a flawed piece of legislation – quite the contrary. Rather, it was amended because, as has been said, recent events took place, of which we are all aware, showing that there was a loophole that needed to be closed in order for it not to occur again. It was also necessary to strengthen certain specific points concerning pharmacovigilance and the safety of medicines once placed on the market. As we have already heard, from now on, marketing authorisation holders who do not renew a marketing authorisation or who withdraw or request the withdrawal or suspension of an authorisation will be obliged to inform the competent authorities of the real reasons and motives for withdrawing or suspending it. This is a major success for transparency and it will prevent the market authorisation holder from trying to conceal the real reasons behind its decision. Moreover, in the event that any of these actions is carried out in a third country, all the Member States in which that medicine is marketed must be informed. All this will improve transparency and safety, without the European Medicines Agency and national agencies being overly burdened as a result. The second important amendment we have achieved is that all authorised products that are subject to some kind of post-authorisation safety study (PASS) will be systematically included on the list of products subject to such monitoring. Lastly, we cannot forget that pharmacovigilance plays a fundamental role, and Parliament should therefore adopt this proposal. Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Perello on the enormous amount of work he has done, on his readiness to collaborate with all the shadow rapporteurs, and also to congratulate the shadow rapporteurs on the way they have all worked with each other. I also praise the Polish Presidency and the Commission for their efforts to reach an agreement on first reading. Parliament, the Council and the Commission have had divergent positions, sometimes very different, on several issues, and this made the agreement far from easy and not fully satisfactory to everyone, but we can say that it is reasonably satisfactory. The point that must be highlighted in the amendment of this directive, as already stated, is that, from now on, sugar may not be added to either pressed or concentrated juices. However, fruit nectars will be products sweetened with sugar, honey or sweeteners. It is clear that the average consumer is unaware of this legislation and, therefore, of the difference between juices and nectars. For this reason, I feel that the agreement between the three institutions to put a statement on packaging for a limited period to say that fruit juices do not contain sugar will not only help consumers to tell the difference between two products, but also make them much better informed. The objective of this initiative was to amend Directive 2001/112/EC for the second time, bringing it into line with technical progress and the developments in international regulations relating to the Codex Alimentarius. However, despite the support of all the farming organisations in the Union, as already mentioned, the Council and the Commission, surprisingly, have rejected the possibility of mandarin juice being added to orange juice in amounts less than 10% and mandarin appearing on the list of ingredients, as permitted by the Codex Alimentarius (STAN 45-1981), given that this is common practice in Brazil and the United States, from which we import a large amount of concentrates. In this regard, another area of conflict during the negotiations was the restoration of flavour, pulp and cells lost during the juice and nectar extraction process. All sides agreed, during the negotiations, to maintain the Commission’s original proposal on restoring flavours, pulp and cells from the same fruit species. However, some members of my political group are going to vote against this report for precisely this reason. Lastly, I would like to mention two things that worry me. Firstly, imported products marketed within the European Union are not generally required to meet the same quality and food safety standards as our own products, and in a case such as this one, in which such standards are required by the legislation, they are not sufficiently controlled. The second thing, which also concerns me, is the way the Commission uses delegated acts to substantially amend legislation, as it has recently attempted to do with the regulation on nutrition and health claims with regard to the ‘no added sugar’ claim. This is similar to what it is trying to do at the moment, although it is not the same case, with the Timber Regulation. This is the reason for Parliament’s position on delegated acts. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner. Mrs Sommer, the shadow rapporteurs, the Hungarian Presidency and the Commission have come to a good agreement with regard to this Regulation which is so important for consumers and the food industry. Many congratulations to all of them. As consumers, of course, we want comprehensive information about everything we eat. However, to put this information on the packaging is no mean feat and we must find a balance in everything. We must also find a cost-benefit balance as we cannot overlook the fact that the information on the labelling, depending on the nature of that information, makes the product more expensive. Someone has to pay that cost. If the consumer does not pay it then many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will have to quit the market as they cannot compete with large companies that can pay this additional cost. I believe that this balance has been achieved and we have to be satisfied. We have to be satisfied with regard to country of origin labelling, for example. It was already foreseen that, where confusion may arise, the origin of products should be labelled. Furthermore, it is permitted that this labelling may be done voluntarily. With regard to processed products containing several ingredients, it is not easy to determine what the main ingredient is. Therefore, another solution other than that adopted would raise implementation problems because of the economic cost and administrative complexity for the companies, without bringing the consumer any clear additional benefit. Also in this context, I agree that this legislation should not be applied to alcohol products as all these products already have comprehensive legislation concerning labelling, and everyone knows that when you drink an alcohol product you are consuming alcohol and that it has calories. In short, all of this is important but, above all, it is very important to educate consumers so that they are able to absorb all this information. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

Mr President, first of all, I wish to express my condolences to the relatives of those who have died as the result of this crisis. Commissioner, informing the public of health risks is a difficult and delicate task and has to be perfectly documented and verified. It is not a question of finding who is to blame, but on this occasion, major errors have occurred, starting with the foolhardy and reckless assumptions of a regional policy manager, recently recruited to the job, who unleashed social alarm and a very serious, irreparable economic crisis. Nor would it appear that the Commission has coordinated this crisis very well. I wonder when the first case occurred, and whether Article 3 of the regulation relating to the rapid alert system – which requires Member States to notify the risk immediately and within 48 hours – was met, and also whether Article 8 of said regulation – which obliges the Commission to check whether the information is complete, true and legible and has sufficient legal basis – was met. What is certain is that the serious shortcomings of this regulation have been exposed and that it is necessary to review the current legal framework in order to define precisely, among other things, the crisis management procedures used by the competent authorities, to attribute errors or omissions to the perpetrator in the food chain (and traceability is used to this end), to prevent health protection from concealing commercial barriers and to arbitrate compensation procedures for damage to trade and loss of profit. Commissioner, neither cucumbers or soya are the cause. As Mr Liese has said, the cause is the pathogen. The cause is serotype O104:H4 of the bacterium Escherichia coli
, which is already described throughout scientific literature and is associated with meat products. However, in any case, Commissioner, we have to allow the scientists to do their work: they need to investigate the entire traceability system, throughout the food chain, including the handling and distribution of food. Pilar Ayuso,

Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Liotard, the Hungarian Presidency and Commissioner Dalli and his team for their efforts. Unfortunately, however, this regulation, which is so important and so necessary, has not reached a satisfactory conclusion because of a labelling requirement that went beyond what was possible in practice. This is a subject that inspires passion and attracts media attention, factors that run counter to logic and pragmatism. I have to say that we have missed the chance to take a step forward, have condemned the agri-food industry to living with obsolete legislation and have put the brakes on European technological advancement, of which we are so supportive in theory. We cannot demand something that involves a level of cost and bureaucracy that cannot be assumed by the food-producing sector, nor can we demand something that we are not capable of imposing upon third parties. We cannot legislate on something that later we will not be able to implement because we would be deceiving consumers. I repeat, it is a pity that we have not reached agreement because this regulation dealt not only with cloning and with how many generations and which products must be labelled, but also with many other points on which agreement has
 been reached, such as nanotechnology and foodstuffs coming from third countries, which were very important for consumers and for the agri-food industry, not only from the point of view of the internal market, but also from a health perspective and in terms of innovation. Since cloning is too complex a matter to relegate to a few paragraphs in another proposal, I urge the Commission once again to prepare a report and present a separate legislative proposal that regulates every aspect of cloning, based on food security and all scientific data. Given that Commissioner Dalli has committed himself on numerous occasions before this House to presenting this proposal, I trust that the Commission will send it to us as soon as possible. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, who has worked very hard and, most importantly, achieved an optimum result. It was not at all easy to reach an agreement at first reading on a regulation as complex as this one. The motor industry is of vital importance in the European Union. It is, moreover, an industry that is committed to the European Union’s objective of reducing emissions and to technological innovation. This agreement is a stable framework that gives legal certainty to our vehicle manufacturers. I believe that the targets for reducing emissions are both ambitious and realistic. Manufacturers will have to achieve 147 grams of CO2
 per kilometre by 2020. I am sure that they are going to succeed, and they will therefore have contributed to the European Union’s objective of reducing emissions by 20% by that year. However, there are also other elements of interest in this new regulation, such as super-credits and promoting alternative fuels. Biofuels are clearly promoted, in line with the EU’s objectives regarding renewable fuels for 2020. I am highlighting this obvious fact because if the Commission continues with its hesitant proposals on biofuels, we will not achieve our objective for 2020. Finally, I would like to end my speech by congratulating the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), who has just become a mother and has worked very hard and also helped to make this agreement a success.

 Madam President, our goals must be ambitious, but it must also be acknowledged that the rapporteur’s proposal is not easy to apply with the situation that exists in each Member State. However, we in the Spanish delegation will support his proposal at first reading. Nevertheless, we are in favour the cost of recycling and treatment being invoiced separately. We are going to vote against Amendment 52, which aims to delete Article 14(1), and in favour of Amendments 91 and 103. We believe that consumers have a right to know what this treatment costs and, moreover, that they should know: that motivates them to collaborate with the legislation itself and it is also positive in order for there to be a suitable amount of transparency in the commercial chain.

on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to highlight the work that has been done by the rapporteur, Mrs McAvan, not only on the content of the report, but also in terms of her methods, because she has worked alongside all the shadow rapporteurs. I would also like to thank the experts from the Spanish Government for their contribution to this agreement. The purpose of this system of pharmacovigilance in the European Union is to strengthen vigilance, transparency and communication in relation to the safety of drugs once they have been put on the market, especially with regard to their risk profiles and the adverse reactions that they can cause. It is important to highlight the creation of the European Pharmacovigilance Committee, which will evaluate and issue recommendations to the European Medicines Agency on the safety issues that can arise in connection with medicines sold in the European Union. The solution that has been reached for both Member States and those responsible for marketing medicines to notify the EudraVigilance database of suspected adverse reactions is very important. EudraVigilance will be the only source of information, but the competent authority in the Member State where it is suspected that an adverse reaction has occurred will be informed at the same time, which is very important. It is also important to highlight the possibility that is being opened up of consumers being able to communicate any adverse reactions, and in this respect, the creation and management by the agency of a European medicines safety web-portal which, in turn, is linked to the portals in each of the Member States, is going to help to improve the public’s knowledge regarding the safety of the medicines that they take. Finally, we cannot forget that given that pharmacovigilance plays a fundamental role in protecting public health, the adoption of this directive and this regulation is going to make a significant contribution to that protection by improving not only the current procedures but also the coordination of actions between the different Member States. Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his explanation about the cloning of animals for use as food. Both Parliament and Commission agree that the Novel Food Regulation was indeed not the appropriate framework to deal with this issue. We agree on this, which explains why the issue has been withdrawn from the scope of application of the regulation. We are also all aware, at least according to all the scientific committees, that cloned animal meat, and that of its offspring, satisfy all food safety requirements. It is only here that I see a problem. Namely, that it is impossible to distinguish whether or not meat comes from a cloned animal, or the offspring of a cloned animal, or from an animal that has not been cloned. Therefore, there is a need – an essential need – to use labelling and traceability in order for the consumer to be informed. Consumers want, and have the right, to know if the meat they are eating comes from a cloned animal or not, regardless of knowing whether or not it is healthy, because they may refuse to eat it owing to the issues you have explained, such as animal welfare, or for ethical reasons. It seems, therefore, given this situation, that the production and consumption of cloned animals in Europe is probably going to be banned, particularly its production. Thus, we are going to ban our producers from using a new technique, one that is good for animal reproduction and which, moreover, can make a profit, because obviously, an animal is cloned as a result of having very special characteristics, something which has been done in Spain with fighting bulls, where, as you know, two fighting bulls have been cloned. And we are going to ban it! Are we going to deny them the possibility of using this technique? Because, if that is the case, then our farmers, our livestock breeders, are going to lose competitiveness. This would be fine if, in Europe, we could ban the entry of meat from cloned animals, and their offspring, from other countries. However, are we going ban it? We cannot do so. The World Trade Organisation is not going to accept our ban. Therefore, we are going to have an absurd situation whereby our livestock breeders are not going to be able to use a new technique that will enable them to become more competitive, yet, we are going to be eating such food in the European Union, with or without a label. This is what worries me, and I feel a solution needs to be found. Why are we going to ban it? Why are we going to prevent our livestock breeders from using this technique, only to later bring this food in from outside because we cannot ban its importation? Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, as you have said, this regulation is very important, not only for consumers, but also for the food industry. It deals with novel foods and new processes for manufacturing foodstuffs. As has been said here, the most controversial issue has been that of meat originating from cloned animals and their offspring, as what generally enters the food chain is the offspring, not the cloned animal. I believe that it was a sensible move on the part of Parliament to remove the issue of meat from cloned animals from this proposal, as it is not really possible to dedicate just a few paragraphs to such a novel and new technique as the cloning of animals, even though it is normal in some countries. There is an amendment relating to this within which the Commission, as you have promised, is asked to present a report and a legislative proposal. We are having a bit of a debate here, including within my own group, as to whether we should ask the Commission to present a proposal banning meat from cloned animals, or simply ask the Commission to present a proposal. My opinion is that the Commission should present the proposal, and we should not tell it how to present it. The Commission should present the proposal, and then we will debate it in Parliament, say whether we like it or do not like it, and amend it. This is my position, although we are divided within my group, and tomorrow we will vote on a divided basis. There is another issue, which interests me a great deal, and which you have mentioned, which is the issue of nanomaterials. I agree that a new definition is needed, but we should not limit ourselves to definition and labelling. Any authorisation of nanomaterials must be preceded by exhaustive scientific tests, as these are new materials that are to be incorporated into food, and the question of food safety needs to be a priority. I hope and trust that this will be the case. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE
) 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this regulation is of crucial importance for consumers and the agri-food industry, because it is not at all easy to achieve balanced labelling that includes all the essential information but not so much as to complicate it. This is an excellent report and the rapporteur must be congratulated on it. I agree with her on the main subjects regarding nutritional information and the controversial issue of profiles, especially if we bear in mind that the Commission failed to meet its commitment to establish these profiles – as well as the conditions for their use – before 19 January, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. An issue that concerns me is the possibility that national labelling standards will be in existence at the same time: this runs counter to the purpose of the legislation, which is harmonisation and the removal of as many obstacles as possible to the working of a true single market. As regards the indication of country of origin, under the current legislation, this information must be given when failure to do so could mislead the consumer. There is also provision for there always being voluntary labelling. Going further may involve a financial cost and administrative cost for companies, without bringing the consumer any significant and clear benefit. On the use of different languages, I have to say that the Commission’s proposal matches up with the existing directive, which has worked well and not caused problems. Reopening this debate could be dangerous and unnecessary, and could cause problems with the movement of products. Pilar Ayuso,

 Mr President, thrombin is an additive that can be used to stick meat because the fact is that there are no technological or food safety problems related to its use. Indeed, it is already used in some countries. The proposed amendment to the annex states that meat processed with thrombin can be sold pre-packed and labelled; thus, the consumer will not be deceived, which is the basic principle of the resolution. Whatever the case, I would like to ask the Commissioner if the European Commission can commit to products that contain thrombin not being able to be considered as imitations as a result of a suitable label, especially within the framework of the present study of the proposed Regulation on the food information provided to the consumer.

Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Jiménez García-Herrera, I would first of all like to highlight the work done by the rapporteurs – Mr Mikolášik and Mr Perello – and all the work that they have done to reach the best possible compromise for a transplant policy in the European Union. I would also like to highlight the contribution made by the Spanish Presidency and by Dr Matesanz, the Director of the Spanish National Transplant Organisation, because Spain is currently the world leader in terms of donations, with 34.4 for every million inhabitants. This is solely due to the constant improvement in organisation and to the measures that have been taken to raise awareness among the population about organ donation. We need to achieve this for the whole of the European Union: increase the number of donations, ensure that all transplants are done to the same quality standards, and also promote cooperation between all the Member States. We also need to ensure that every donation is voluntary and not rewarded, with the exceptions listed by Commissioner Dalli, in order to combat organ trafficking, which is entirely linked to a scarcity of organs. The action plan can contribute to this by helping to solve the shortage of organs and improving public access to transplants. The solution that has been reached for living donors is very important, as we cannot forget that living donations are complementary and have been shown to be effective even if there is no genetic relationship between the donor and the recipient.

Mr President, I want to begin by congratulating the Commissioner, because she works tirelessly in this area – I can vouch for that – especially given that this topic that we are discussing is really very complicated. I would also add the following. There is one area, Commissioner, in which we have demonstrated that we definitely can reduce emissions –indeed, we are seeing its positive impact on growth, competitiveness and, therefore, job creation – and in which Europe is a leader in the technological sphere and is carrying out many actions with specific objectives: that area is energy efficiency. I have said it before and I will say it again now. I believe that Doha, like the last COP in Durban, is a great opportunity for Europe, and the European Union, to head up the development of a road map for energy efficiency, with different types of goals, with common actions, with deadlines, etc. This really needs a precise structure and framework, and the European Union, more than anyone, has an undeniable opportunity to pioneer a road map for energy efficiency.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, what we are debating today are two reports: one by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and another by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The aim of these reports is, among other things, to convey to the Commission Parliament’s views on shale gas so that at a later date, as the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Potočnik, has said, the Commission can present a report on a series of measures relating to this energy source to enable harmonised action within the European Union. I believe that both rapporteurs have put forward the points of view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in a very reasonable manner. Logically their perspectives are not exactly the same. In the case of the two Commissioners, they have set out their vision with a great deal of balance and in a measured way, which is essential for any debate such as this to take place. Someone said before I took the floor that one cannot debate using emotions and when emotions are running high. I ask you who can name or talk about a single energy source that does not carry risks and opportunities for developing the benefits that it brings. The same applies to this one. If humanity had rejected every advance, every encounter, every discovery of the possibility of developing an energy source solely due to the risks that it carried, we would have made no progress at all. We have to insist much more that the technology is as good as possible, that there is investment into research and that this new source of energy can be developed, with all the guarantees in place, in a measured way and without emotion.

Mr President, Commissioner, please allow me to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Kariņš, and all the shadow rapporteurs, who took the decision to continue moving forward during the negotiation in the trialogues, which was fraught with difficulties, and described so well by Mr Kariņš. I would say that thanks to that effort and determination, we now have a mechanism that, for the first time, allows information and communication to be exchanged between Member States and the Commission regarding intergovernmental agreements in the field of energy that are reached in those Member States. I believe the idea is to have constant knowledge of the supply map or the energy supply networks and it is very positive, therefore, for the improved management of energy supply in the European Union. When it comes to this regulation, if I had to use a simile, I would say we are paving the way to progressing more quickly in developing the internal energy market. If we throw this opportunity away and do not start paving the way, as is the desire of a certain political group in the House, we would simply be missing a golden opportunity. After a time, we would find ourselves in the same situation as today, but much further down the line. I trust, therefore, there will be a lot of parliamentary support for this proposal tomorrow. I thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs once again for their contribution. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, this is undoubtedly one of the most important legislative contributions in the field of energy in this parliamentary term. Ultimately, there will be few other things that will have the same significance as this Energy Efficiency Directive, and this is as a result of tenacity and hard work. It is as a result of the work done by the rapporteur, but also by shadow rapporteurs who have done truly admirable work, and I therefore congratulate them all. This directive basically has three objectives: it will help to make the European Union less of an energy island, it will help to make climate change targets a reality, and it will also help to develop an energy efficiency market that will make it possible to have greater economic growth through the right technologies. I would, however, like to highlight one thing which I think is the major contribution that Parliament is making to this directive, which is flexibility: flexibility in the 1.5% savings target for energy distributors and sellers, or the target of renovating 3% of buildings; and the flexibility that Member States have to apply alternative measures. This is the key, because there is a great deal of diversity within the European Union. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

 Mr President, allow me to also begin by personally congratulating Ms Niebler for having led so professionally and so successfully, on Parliament’s behalf, the third regulation on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union, now known as ‘Roaming III’. Not only has it been a success – as far as I can see – by substantially lowering the upper limits of what operators can charge consumers for mobile services when they are in another EU Member State, but the proposal for a regulation that we will vote on in this plenary session also includes other measures such as, for example, extending transparency clauses to European consumers travelling to non-Member States. However, above all, the greatest merit of the Roaming III Regulation is – in my view – its desire to become obsolete and create a competitive market for roaming services themselves, where it will no longer be necessary to regulate the situation in each of the different 27 markets every two years, but rather the situation in the single market, which should represent the European Union. This regulation, which we will vote on tomorrow, will not only be limited on this occasion to establishing new maximum tariffs that mobile phone operators must respect when European consumers travel outside the European Union, but, for the first time, we are tackling the situation – in my view, in a much more intelligent way – by establishing a competitive market. If the structural measures proposed in the regulation are successful, we European consumers will have the option of taking out a roaming contract with a different operator to the one providing us with mobile services in our own country, and we will be able to do this simply and keep our phone number. It is an essential contribution to the development of the digital single market. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am just going to go over two points very quickly. The first is possibly the most discussed issue in this report and that which has led to the most disagreement: whether or not to deal with the emissions trading mechanism. It is clear that it is suffering like any other ‘market’, and it is suffering due to the downturn, but I think it would be wrong to intervene in this market. To intervene to try to improve prices, as is done in other sectors, would be a serious error. More growth is needed. What we have to do is give it a boost, so that we can emerge from the crisis and then the emissions market will return to how it was. Secondly, when it comes to the Roadmap, as has been said here, there are a lot of uncertainties. If I had to draw up a map with different roads to take us to the final objective, which would be a low-carbon economy, there is one road, one route that is the main route: that of energy efficiency. In this area, we can indeed say and plan many things. We have reached agreement on the Energy Efficiency Directive, with a huge effort made by all the parliamentary groups. This is the same agreement that my group and I would like to see reflected in today’s vote on the report we are debating. I honestly believe it is worth it. We managed it for energy efficiency, why can we not do the same with this report? Pilar del Castillo Vera,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, I think that your explanation was a very logical one, full of common sense. The thing is that sometimes such explanations, which are really very sound, compete with reflections that are equally sound. I think that what we do in Parliament at this point serves as a wake-up call to ensure that an instrument that has had a history of success does not disappear because of theoretical solutions which could in principle, theoretically, turn out to be more efficient but which would, in any event, put an end to the development of a tool that has made a very real contribution so that many programmes derive from it and have very important consequences for energy saving. I am not going to mention them all but there is no doubt that actions such as European Local ENergy Assistance (ELENA), Solar Keymark or GreenLight are success stories. All this has always been based upon a fundamental pillar, namely, innovation, even in these especially severe times of crisis in Europe. It is impossible for societies that do not make innovation the driving force of their development to survive in such a competitive, global society and here we have before us a tool that has proved useful precisely for the purpose of developing innovation in the energy sector. Therefore, Commissioner, our modest contribution is to insist that a tool such as this must not be wasted because it has been tried and tested and, accordingly, we have to give extremely careful consideration to the fact that this intelligent energy tool for Europe could disappear.

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we are faced with one of the issues that forms the basis for the success of the Internet, namely the competitive nature and neutral character of the network. In this sense, everything that is related to that aspect is extremely important. I would say that the resolution we are proposing and debating this afternoon is, without a doubt, particularly balanced. It is in accordance with the Commission, in the sense that, when information exists that gives us an indication that a change is occurring to the neutral character of the network, then that would be the moment to propose some kind of legislative action, but that, in the meantime, it is necessary to wait to see what is contained in the report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications. I would like to add something else: there are three conditions sine qua non
, which, in my view, are essential for guaranteeing neutrality on the network. Firstly, there needs to be a truly competitive market for service and telecommunications operators. Secondly, the user needs to be able to change supplier quickly and easily. Otherwise, without a doubt, the market will be very weak from a competitive point of view. Third is transparency. Transparency means, however, that users must be properly informed of all the criteria used by network operators, so that they can really know whether or not they are of interest to them or, on the contrary, whether or not it is of interest to them to switch supplier, as was previously commented. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, I would also like to address Mr Barroso, even though he is not here right now, via the Commissioner. I believe that a reasonable work programme has been set, as in previous years. However, what I feel is missing is the sense of urgency, and this worries me. In many countries, of course including Spain, my own Member State, people get up every morning driven by the urgency of the reforms that must be carried out: in the job market, in budgetary stability, public debt, and so on. What we have here is a programme that, to my way of thinking, lacks that sense of urgency. The main thing it lacks is, essentially, the power of the European Union project to help develop growth and employment, which is the internal market, and the digital internal market as a variant of this. We urgently need to address everything that continues to hinder the development of the internal market today – and there is still a lot – in terms of the transposition and development of directives (such as the Services Directive), and many other aspects that prevent us from unifying and integrating the extraordinary legislative fragmentation currently hampering the development of that market. My main message is that you need to regain the sense of urgency, because if you do not, there is not much that the European Union can do. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I believe the climate change conference in Durban has an advantage over its immediate predecessors: there is no doubt whatsoever that achieving a binding international agreement is impossible. This should enable energy to be channelled into proposals and joint lines of action that will indeed allow us to progress in practice towards the goal of emissions cuts. So this is good news, because we were not in this position in Cancún, much less when the Copenhagen climate summit was held. I believe this is the time for the European Union to become the regional leader in energy efficiency proposals, which really can unite the work of a great number of other countries, from the most developed and the richest, to the least developed and the poorest. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fighting against climate change by boosting energy efficiency brings incredible opportunities in all areas, and I sincerely believe that it is time for the European Union to become the leader in combating climate change through energy efficiency.

 Mr President, Commissioner, whenever there has previously been any discussion about SMEs, the focus has been on intervention in financial matters, the lack of liquidity and problems in accessing credit, because that is really the main problem. It is the main problem for governments, SMEs, all companies, banks and, to a large extent, I would say it is the main problem, above all, for each and every member of society. However, allow me to focus on one dimension that I feel is strategically fundamental, and that has only been partially touched upon. It is to do with the internal market. Over recent weeks, the European institutions have been insisting on the importance of taking a decisive step forward in developing the internal market as a strategic element or strategic factor in overcoming the crisis. If we look at the relationship between the internal market and SMEs today, we can see that only 23% of these companies engage in cross-border trade, and that only 13% export outside the European Union, and this gives us a clear idea of how far we still have to go in this area. The problem is that it is very difficult to tackle the current legislative fragmentation on basic issues in the internal market. When SMEs compare the costs and profits, it is really very hard for them to finance the fragmentation in the internal market today, and this is something that must be resolved.

 Mr President, we are discussing a report that the Commission presented when the occasion arose on the strategy for tackling a matter of special importance, namely, the volatility of prices of raw materials and the increase in demand for raw materials on the part of developing countries, especially China. For my group’s part, we wish to express our thanks for the Bütikofer report and to say that to a very large degree we share the views expressed in it because we consider that it develops, brings into focus and adopts a truly satisfactory approach to raw materials and the strategy for their use, access and development. In that sense, we think that the report we are debating adopts a balanced approach to access to raw materials both within and outside the EU, raw materials which are fundamental and critical. We think that adequate emphasis is placed on the importance of using sources of raw materials efficiently, and that a number of very interesting proposals are put forward for improving recycling practices in the EU. In addition, I would like to point out on behalf of my group that in our opinion, bearing in mind that maintaining growth is fundamental, the issue should not be tackled from the point of view of reducing consumption. Economic growth must be maintained and promoted and, accordingly, what we need to consider are policies for efficient use of these raw materials and policies that truly incentivise rational use of the same. Likewise, we believe that the impact on speculation will be positive because, as a result of the transparency measures proposed by the Commission, we will face a more transparent market than the one in which we find ourselves today and, accordingly, one with reduced scope for speculation.

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have to be careful how debates develop. When the Commissioner is constantly being interrupted, there is then an avalanche of questions from other Members of the House, and it is very difficult for the debate to remain on the subject that is being examined and in relation to the points the Commissioner has raised, rather than other Members’ wishes. The first thing I want to say is that some Members of this House need to show a little humility and a little common sense, because they make it appear that they are the only ones that have ever thought about nuclear safety and the only ones who are worried about the future of their children and humanity. The 58 reactors in France or those in the United Kingdom or those in many other countries do not mean that the French or others may be more stupid or less intelligent, or that the future of their children does not worry them, or that they have never thought about nuclear safety. Ladies and gentlemen, nuclear safety is something that is being continually worked on in all nuclear plants in relation to every nuclear reactor. There are many top-quality professionals, not people sitting here spouting hot air, but rather people that have been working on these issues day in day out since the beginning. Is a joint review of stress tests now required? I am completely in agreement, and I have to say that some of the people that are now talking about these issues refused to endorse this Parliament’s joint resolution on this subject, which was supported by the majority of the groups in the House. On that basis, a distinction must be made: we are talking about stress tests and not the abolition of nuclear energy. Those will be national debates and they will have to be carried out there. This is why, speaking of stress tests, because some people do not want to talk about it, they only speak or discuss this in one debate or another with an undertone of eliminating nuclear energy, I have to say that Commissioner Oettinger has done an extraordinary job in a very short time. He has already agreed and carried out, in practice, a series of measures and tests that will show us the extent of the situation we are now in. Therefore, Commissioner, congratulations, we cannot have anything other than appreciation for you in how you have acted. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, today, we find ourselves discussing in this House a joint proposal for a resolution on the revision of the Small Business Act, which the Commission submitted in February. The relationship between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the economy can be defined in many ways, but in a sense, they are the axis around which any economic system revolves, in this case, the European economies. If they are strong, the economy will do well; if they are weak, the economy will do badly. SMEs generate jobs, growth and, accordingly, prosperity for society. I shall refer to three factors that seem to me to be fundamental to achieving a strong network of enterprises. First, the adoption of information and communication technology and the development of technologies such as online administration or cloud computing, which save money, reduce costs and effort and, therefore, improve the competitiveness of SMEs. Second, innovation, which is equally fundamental in this sector. Accordingly, up-and-coming enterprises in the small and medium-sized business sector must be strongly incentivised. Third, SMEs must be able to participate fully in the internal market, both in terms of cross-border public tendering and as regards all other features of the internal market, which are capable of providing extraordinary benefits to SMEs in terms of their competitiveness but are currently failing to do so. Finally, after all this comes the value of entrepreneurship, a social value which must be strong since, if it is not, the whole network will be weak. In this area, both governments and the European Union have much to do, principally through education. Pilar del Castillo Vera,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, our colleague, Mr Hökmark, because his work is excellent and, in addition to being excellent, it has great vision for the future, which I think makes it particularly valuable. However, please also allow me to thank, as he did, all the shadow rapporteurs. The result of all this work was the unanimous backing that this report received in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Of course, the report before us is guided by an objective, which is none other than a way of making the European economy more competitive in a global world. That is the key objective of this report and I therefore believe that it is extraordinarily appropriate. I am not going to go into the details, but I would like to focus on two or three aspects that I consider key. First of all, we are in a situation – and this report points this out – in which wireless broadband through the 800 MHz allocation for mobile communications across Europe will be a reality. However the report goes much further: it is thinking more about the future. We are talking about the 700 MHz frequency band, which also has an extraordinary capacity for mobile telephony and its development. I believe that is why we also have to view and evaluate the proposals made in the report very positively. It is not a trivial issue: the spectrum relating to economic activities currently represents 3% of European gross domestic product (GDP) and that is just the start. I should like to mention the importance of video’s exponential growth as an element of communication between different people, and between different institutions and companies. Right now, video represents 40% of world traffic and that is only the start: by 2014, it will represent 91% of end-user traffic. As such, the report positions itself realistically in a vision of an extraordinary future, so I believe that we should give it our full support the day after tomorrow. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need energy to eat, travel, study, cure diseases, and for many other things. That energy has always come from a variety of sources. In some cases, from the oldest sources, such as hydropower, fossil energy, and even nuclear energy; in other cases, from the most modern, for example, renewables. In addition to this, technologies are being developed to bring about increased safety, in some cases, or to offer greater efficiency, as in the case of renewable energies. There is also research that has not yet been applied, such as carbon storage, or that which is expected to – and will – lead us to fusion power. All of this is necessary, ladies and gentlemen, because human life has operated and developed on the basis of constant improvements to the resources used and the research that made this possible. Communication, energy, medicine and study are based on that: the continual improvement of all our resources. Recently, the tsunami and the earthquake that caused it resulted in serious damage for the people of Japan, including victims, missing people and material losses, as well as significant damage to the Fukushima plant. With all that in mind, what we have to do is improve safety. Tomorrow, this House will vote on a joint resolution, on which the vast majority of the parliamentary groups have agreed. It expresses what unites us, not what divides us. I would ask the groups to remain loyal to the content of the proposal and not to allow their own interests to get in the way of the common interest or of the shared view that we have achieved on this proposal. That is our responsibility for tomorrow. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would also like to start by thanking Mr Lange for his efforts in bringing together so many differing opinions and visions, a situation that is quite common in Parliament. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various political groups. In fact, this report tries to answer a question that has already been under consideration for a long time: do European industries have any future in a global world? I think the answer is yes. Yes, because European Union countries are proving that they do. Yes, because there are also specific European industrial sectors that are proving that they do. All of this has to do with a number of aspects: some are related to the job market, because we need a flexible job market, not a rigid one; others are related to productivity, financial policies and tax incentives. However, allow me to highlight three that are now closely linked to the European Union itself. Firstly, the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. These are two key issues. Enterprise and innovation are key elements of the future of any industry in Europe. Particular attention should be paid to young entrepreneurs. Secondly, strengthening the internal market and making sure it is competitive and, internally, based on free competition. Therefore, the subsidies still being given to transport, energy, and publicly owned businesses should be reduced so as to ensure free competition within the European internal market. Thirdly, respecting the conditions of competition within the international framework: when it comes to environmental policies and product sourcing, it is vital to compete on equal terms. We do not want protectionism within the European Union, nor do we want protectionism when our industry competes with third countries and third regions. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission and the parliamentary delegation, led by our fellow Member Mr Leinen, on the work that they did in Cancún, a meeting that I was unfortunately unable to attend in the end. I believe that Cancún and its results can be viewed, along the lines of what my colleague, Mr Seeber, was saying, from the perspective of Copenhagen: Cancún viewed from the Copenhagen perspective. The first conclusion from this perspective is that there was a fundamental differentiating factor. In Copenhagen, the expectations were very high, and in Cancún the expectations were much more realistic, as a result of which the assessment of Copenhagen was very negative, while the assessment of Cancún, both by those who took part and by the media in general, was very positive. Cancún learned lessons from Copenhagen, and I think that is the first, very interesting, conclusion. I believe that measures have been taken and agreements reached which are not, of course, ground-breaking, but which could be very interesting from the point of view of efficiency. Among other things, I think that the creation of a committee and a technology network to promote technological cooperation is extremely important. Here, we are going to adopt a report during this sitting on energy efficiency, which is one of the fundamental keys to effectively combating climate change. Also, I think that matters such as the World Bank being more involved or official recognition of the actions of countries to reduce emissions returning to the procedure and framework of the United Nations are very positive. Finally, I would like to say that there is one year to go before we get to South Africa. It would be a very good idea if, in the same way that Cancún learnt from Copenhagen, we now learnt from Kyoto, and achieved an international frame of reference for an agreement against climate change that is more flexible, more transparent, more efficient and more integrative.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job. Her report is, of course, as ambitious as it is extensive, and I must say that it is the result of the tough and successful negotiations that resulted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopting it practically unanimously. Continuing with this subject, I would like to point out something of which we are all aware, but which there is no harm in saying: the energy situation in Europe is not exactly an optimum one. Not only are we increasingly dependent on energy imports obtained from outside Europe, but we are also having to deal with the huge investments needed in our energy infrastructures at a time when Europe is still suffering the consequences of the crisis. This is all in the context of not yet having managed to apply our own energy legislation. Now in this parliamentary term we have an instrument that was not available in the previous one. The Treaty of Lisbon not only provides a series of clear objectives such as the internal energy market, security of supply, energy efficiency and promoting energy networks, but it also gives the European Union a legal framework and a sound legal basis – Article 194 – for acting in the field of energy policy. In this new context in which we are having this debate, I ask all my fellow Members to support this report, which proposes a series of measures aimed at guaranteeing energy supply and full implementation of the existing legislation and programmes. It also stresses the need to invest in research, promotes the development of pan-European energy grids and gives the creation of the internal energy market the priority it deserves. Thank you very much, and I ask you all to support this report tomorrow. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 – (ES) 
Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, I would like to start by saying that I felt that both speeches by the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner gave a very different perspective on the Cancún conference to their perspective on the Copenhagen conference. It is a more realistic, much more viable perspective, and there is therefore much more potential for it to be effective. If Copenhagen was the all-or-nothing summit – as the President-in-Office of the Council said – Cancún must be the summit that provides a variety of viable and efficient options. The battle against climate change has two fundamental features: firstly it has to be global, involving all the major polluters, from the United States to Brazil, China and India. Secondly, it has to be a series of measures that are effective in their impact on climate change, we need to be able to measure that impact, and they must not be detrimental to economic growth. In this respect we also need to have the humility to recognise that the global challenge of tackling climate change offers a variety of technological and political options. There are and may be binding agreements, there are sectoral agreements, there is technology transfer and there is support for research. All the options need to be brought into play, along with a radical increase in energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy and of society. This is the only way that we will be able to effectively tackle the problems of climate change. In this respect, if Cancún is the summit that produces a variety of viable and efficient agreements, it will have been a great success. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, in this time of crisis, in which we find ourselves, there are two main types of policies and actions: preventive policies and actions and stimulative policies and actions. Preventive policies are those that currently concern the supervision of financial services, governance and strengthening governance. In other words, anything that is going to alert us to the fact that there are problems before the problems overwhelm the European economies. However, the second type of policies – stimulative policies – are essential. There are three fundamental aspects of these policies, Mr Barroso, Mr Wathelet. Naturally, there are more, but I am going to highlight three: research and innovation, the development of a digital society – in other words, the digital agenda – and the internal market. The first, research and innovation, is where I find the work programme presented by the Commission to be lacking. President Barroso said earlier that the specific programmes will come in mid-2011, but I do not think that is enough. I can assure you that I and my group would very much have liked to see a reference to the Eighth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, which does not feature in your proposal. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioners, Mr Magnette, there can be no doubt that the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico has raised awareness of these types of situations, while exposing the need to analyse them in depth and to take measures to prevent or counteract them. These things also occur in Europe. They have occurred. I am a national of a country, Spain, where not many years ago, we had a problem – in the north of the country – with spillages of this type due to problems with transportation, in this case, a problem with tankers. When we find ourselves faced with a situation of this type, the risk is to act emotively and without thinking all that much, and therefore without any balance in decision making, which may have undesirable consequences. I believe that what the Commissioners explained to us, the ten points that Commissioner Oettinger set out, is a very important and interesting approximation of the problem, and that it is along the right lines. There is a need to act forcefully with regard to civil responsibility and partnership, arrive at joint positions with the International Maritime Organisation, harmonise the legislation of Member States better, etc., but this needs to be done in such a way that the actions we take do not have any undesirable consequences. What needs to be done therefore needs to be assessed very well, including economically, together with its impact. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, many fellow Members have wondered why the Lisbon Agenda failed and whether we should start by analysing that failure in order to take the next steps. In my view, the problem with the Lisbon Agenda was that it was ultimately nothing more than a symbol enclosed in a bubble, which was not implemented at all in practice. In the end we found that on the one hand there was a theory, the Lisbon Agenda, about which we were all talking, and on the other hand there was the practice, which had nothing to do with it. Therefore, in my view, based on this experience the Europe 2020 strategy must be a new agenda that can only be taken forward if there is a resounding commitment – I would stress, a resounding commitment – from all the institutions: the European political institutions and the national political institutions. This commitment also needs to be one that can be verified and evaluated; it needs to be one that we have information about and an immediate capacity to correct if the commitments are not being fulfilled when there are failures. This is so that we do not find ourselves in any situation of extreme circumstances. Either we all understand that this joint project needs these instruments in order to move forward, or we will soon be in a similar situation. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, this is a debate on an issue on which there is generally a great deal of agreement, so it is not one of those debates in which there are radically different positions, but rather the positions are different in simple terms. We heard this in the speech by Mr López Garrido, and in the speech by the Commissioner, and it is reflected in the resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow in Parliament with the support of all the political groups. Having said this, there are a series of problems to resolve before electric cars can be fully efficient, and the task that we now have in front of us is to focus on seeing how we can resolve these problems as soon as possible so that electric cars can also become part of the whole project of having more sustainable and efficient energy consumption. In this respect I would like to highlight one of the issues that has been mentioned, which is also in the resolution, which is the issue of research. There are still a series of fundamental problems linked to the efficiency of the batteries and recharging, as well as the problems of standardisation, interoperability, and so on, which have a long way to go. In order for this ground to be covered as soon as possible, I think that it is essential, as in so many other aspects linked to energy and other issues, that efforts are focused on research. This does require an enormous effort from a financial point of view, both from the European institutions and from the national institutions. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Madam President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso – who is not here, but whom I am also addressing – the truth is that it has been very good to see you together and, in my opinion, this is because we have seen that there is a move towards and a focus on what should be the foundations of the common strategy in the next ten years and, in my view, this is extremely important. What most interested me about the proposal that we have seen in writing and what you have said is that there only need to be a few objectives: only the top-priority objectives; that they need to be tangible, that we need to be able to measure them and they need to be constantly evaluated in order to see whether or not we are making progress in that direction. I think this is fundamental, and it is a substantial change from the Lisbon Strategy. I am going to highlight one objective: the internal market. The European internal market was conceived more than 20 years ago. Twenty years later, there is a long way to go before we have a truly internal European market in the majority of sectors. In some cases, this is because they are very new sectors, such as the digital market, but in other cases, there is such a degree of fragmentation and such barriers that we are depriving the European economy of the large-scale framework that it needs in order to be able to really develop all the competitiveness that it needs, which will bring about growth, which, in turn, will bring about employment. Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, we need a great deal of political impetus: ‘business as usual’ can no longer be a tool. We need a great deal of leadership, and you have a big responsibility. You do, of course, have my full support for making this possible. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, I would firstly like to recognise the effort made, and also the enthusiasm shown by both the Commission and the Council and, of course, Parliament over such a long period throughout this programme to combat climate change. I would like to say that there are a series of certainties that should map out our route for us. The first one is this: we need everyone to take part, especially all the countries that are major polluters. The second near-certainty is this: based on all the information we have, it appears that it will be very difficult for a legally binding agreement to be reached in Copenhagen, in the same way as the agreements on the percentage of emissions are, of course, binding. This reality should not, however, cause us to give up, because pessimism results from failing to acknowledge reality. On the contrary, optimism is based on acknowledging reality. What should we do in Copenhagen, essentially? Of course, we should not forget the possibility of reaching that general agreement. As we are aware of the situation and the possibilities that exist, however, I think we should concentrate on sectoral agreements that are really valid, with viable objectives. I have in mind an agreement on deforestation, an agreement on aid for emerging countries and developing countries, but most importantly, an agreement on technology transfer. I also think it would be an extremely good idea to have agreements to promote programmes so that the industrial sectors that consume the most energy worldwide can reach agreements on emissions, whichever country they are in. This would also make our economies more competitive. To conclude, I would like to stress that optimism is based on realism and effectiveness is based on setting viable objectives. This should be our guide at all times. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks to my fellow Members, and in this case, mainly to the rapporteur, Mrs Trautmann, because she has really done an extraordinary job. You had to be there to know how much was achieved in this final stage, which resulted in success in the conciliation process. I would say that at the moment, we are in an excellent position to begin to tackle a future that is, in a sense, revolutionary, or should be revolutionary. We finally have – or we are soon going to have – a regulatory framework that lays some very good foundations for putting the development of the internet, the digital society and the digital economy at the forefront of our objectives. This framework provides good protection for consumers, promotes their rights and also provides security for investors. I think, however, that it is very important for us to now look decisively towards the future. We must look decisively beyond 2010 so that we can devote all our efforts to setting a digital agenda beyond 2010. The key objectives of this digital agenda should include: enabling everyone, as consumers and citizens, to have all the resources needed to access and participate through the internet and, of course, developing an internal digital market that is open and competitive. This is an absolutely essential objective if we want to put the European economy where it should be in the global world of today. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission. With regard to the subject that we are debating, there are some certainties and a set of uncertainties. The first certainty, or the first common element, is that there is now a major convergence of opinion that emissions need to be reduced and that clean energy sources need to be developed. The second certainty is that there needs to be a global approach to or way of dealing with the problem. Therefore, the countries that emit the most CO2
 into the atmosphere need to take part in all international agreements. The major producers of CO2
 include the United States, China, India and Brazil. The third certainty is that the European Union is putting a proposal on the table that is an obligatory system of targets: 20% or 30%. The fourth certainty is that there are no reasonable signs, for various reasons, that the major CO2
 emitting countries are going to accept an agreement of this nature, and that is the reality. There is not such a lack of optimism if we acknowledge the reality; pessimism wins the day if we do not know the reality. It is only by acknowledging the reality that we can create an effective policy, and it will be a more optimistic policy. I think that the European Union, as it takes the lead on this issue, has a duty to put additional measures and additional proposals on the table. Japan has been mentioned here, and we have to talk about the success of projects such as the Sector Focus project, which affect the most polluting industries. On the basis of a process of benchmarking, such projects have achieved extraordinary objectives in Japan. These are the realistic ways of tackling climate change. Copenhagen is an opportunity, but it will only be an opportunity for efficiency rather than rhetoric if we base it on reality. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being very clear in your explanation of the current situation in relation to Nabucco and its potential and viability – seemingly in the short term, according to what you said – and also for the information on the Desertec project. There can be no doubt that the Sun is an extraordinary source of energy. Converting this energy into energy that can be used by people is an area which has seen major developments in the last 20 years. However, there is also no doubt that we still have a way to go before the full potential and viability of this source can be technologically assured, particularly in projects such as the Desertec project which we are now discussing. This project is very welcome and we must therefore support it and keep moving forward in order to solve the technological problems. However, I must really draw your attention to the fact that, when talking about energy efficiency, and particularly about security of supply and therefore diversification of energy sources, one particular energy source is ignored to a certain extent. I am of course talking about nuclear energy. This energy source is systematically being discriminated against, because it does not fit with what is happening in many EU countries or with global trends or with mankind’s current energy needs. This situation must be turned on its head. We must adopt an attitude of considering all possible energy sources in terms of the role that they can play. Here in this Parliament we cannot so obviously turn our backs on this reality. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to use this minute to mention the tragic consequences of the heavy rains which have fallen in southern and south-eastern Spain, particularly in the region of Valencia, Murcia and part of Andalusia. There was torrential rainfall on 28 September 2012 which caused very considerable damage across the whole agricultural sector. Thousands of hectares of crops were flattened, and many farms were completely ruined. The livestock sector also suffered losses, and damage was caused to the municipal road network, to street lighting, homes, buildings, and to industrial and commercial premises. I would also like to stress the difficulties which were already being experienced in Lorca, a town which, as you know, suffered a powerful earthquake a year ago, along with Puerto Lumbreras. Those two towns, those two Spanish municipalities in the region of Murcia, and all those in these and other regions, are seeking the solidarity of the European Union in order to be able to carry on.

 Madam President, the coastal regions, seas and oceans are undoubtedly of fundamental importance for the economic growth of the European Union and all its Member States. Following the Commission’s communication, an ‘Action Plan for an integrated maritime policy for the European Union’, known as the ‘Blue Book’, we are now in the current situation where the idea of an integrated maritime policy is welcome, and what it does and aims to do is certainly to make better use of the opportunities the sea provides. They know that this idea will form the basis for specific environmental and maritime transport policies which are so important for all these areas and for energy, research, fishing and regional policies. All of these aspects are, of course, vital for all these regions. I myself, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, fully support the proposal for a regulation and, furthermore, we believe that the EUR 40 million allocated for the current 2011-2013 period is sufficient. I should also like to say that it would be necessary for this funding to continue into the future, after 2014, since we need to consolidate the process that has been initiated and thereby ensure the continuation of such a promising course of action. I should also like to say that there should be a consistent approach to all the seas within the European Union so that we can see the range of projects and gain real first-hand knowledge of what the issues are in each sea basin. Clearly, the problems of the North Sea are not the same as those of the Mediterranean; hence, it would be valuable to adopt a consistent approach in order to discover more about this diversity. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the various opinions that have been drafted to finalise a programme which we see as of great importance for the future of the European Union.

Madam President, 80 million people, 16% of the population of the European Union, suffer from some kind of disability. This is why Mr Kósa’s report is so timely. It is an important report that discusses the European Disability Strategy and analyses it in detail. I would like to highlight three ideas in this report. The first of these is inclusive education, which is necessary so that each student’s individual characteristics can be taken into account, as required by Article 24 of the United Nations Convention. The second idea is the need for the employment market to open up to people with disabilities, so that we can meet the Europe 2020 strategy target of 75% employment. The third idea is that the economic crisis must never be an excuse to discriminate against disabled people. Lastly, other significant ideas in the report include a single European mobility card that would allow all benefits and rights to be mutually recognised in the Member States, and a similarly unified travel card to consolidate our efforts to help this group.

 Mr President, on 29 June this year the Majorcan pilot Antonio Planas, who was 49 years old, lost his life, the victim of a Taliban terrorist attack, along with 20 other people in Kabul. Antonio was married and he was the father of an eight-year-old girl. He worked for a Turkish airline and his death took place outside the EU. I am using this minute to point out that all those Europeans who are the victims of a terrorist attack outside the EU do not qualify for the forms of compensation that they would qualify for if the attack had taken place within a Member State. Imagine the position of Antonio’s daughter and his widow: they are victims of terrorism but they cannot enjoy the same rights as if the attack had taken place in Spain. Therefore, I would like to seek protection for all those Europeans who are the victims of terrorism when the death takes place outside the territory of the EU. In Spain a law is being formulated, the law for the recognition and comprehensive protection of victims of terrorism, which appears to be capable of correcting that grave error and of rehabilitating and protecting all victims of terrorism equally, in favour of memory, dignity, justice and truth, which are doubtless the ideas that underlie the law itself.

 Mr President, cohesion policy has undoubtedly contributed to increased productivity in all regions of the EU and to eliminating regional disparities and there is no doubt that it has proved fundamental for all citizens and that it is helping – and will continue to help – to combat the economic and financial crisis Europe is suffering. This is why the fifth cohesion report is so timely. There are three key ideas. The first is that gross domestic product should be supplemented by other indicators on the part of national and regional authorities. The second idea is that there should be an intermediate category so that all regions that do not come under convergence and do not manage to achieve competitiveness can be treated in a similar way when similar situations arise and so that these regions do not ever suffer a sudden change. The third idea is to reinforce Objective 3. I wish to make two requests. The maximum distance of 150 kilometres should be removed to enable many regions such as, for example, the Balearic Islands to access cross-border cooperation. My second point is that the report says that the working languages of the EU are French, English and German. That is not so. The 23 languages of the EU are what make us rich and diverse.

 Madam President, in January, the European Commission approved the strategy to tackle early school dropout as a key contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy to fight the school dropout problem across the entire European Union and reduce rates by at least 10%. Strangely, this strategy does not make any reference to disabled people, and this is why I would like to use this minute to make an appeal, since the education ministers of all the Member States will be meeting in Brussels on 2 and 4 May to discuss the global strategies around this issue. I would like to ask that the issue of disabled people be included within this strategy, because it is of fundamental importance for this group of people all over Europe to receive continuous education and therefore to be able to access the labour market. Article 24 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that disabled people are not, under any circumstances, to be excluded from the general education system.

Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the working group led by the chair of the Committee on Regional Development, which has made it possible for us to have this debate today. We certainly all agree that cohesion policy is the essential element for achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and also for achieving European integration and achieving the economic, social and territorial cohesion set out in the Treaty of Lisbon that people are clamouring for so much. What we need to start doing now, in my view, is to see what mistakes we have made and improve what we have done so far. We all agree that the process needs to be much more flexible, there need to be fewer bureaucratic obstacles, and the controls need to be simpler. Also, the regions with specific difficulties, such as islands, mountainous areas, cross-border regions and outermost regions, must receive specific treatment. Gross domestic product must continue to be the main criterion, although there might be other indicators in other decision-making processes, and the regions and local bodies must play a fundamental role. It seems that we all agree on this. So we are going to go down this road, but the Commission should clarify for us whether this is indeed the road we should go down or whether it should be another one. It needs to clarify whether we are going to have the same budgets, which is absolutely essential in order for no one to lose out and for all the regions to be able to make progress in terms of innovation, competitiveness, development, income and progress, especially in a time of crisis when clarity is needed more than ever.

Mr President, I would first of all like to thank all those who signed this motion for a resolution, which is welcomed extremely warmly by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and in Spain, the country that we represent. We have the legal framework, which is Article 174(3) of the Treaty of Lisbon. We also have territorial cohesion, which is the new pillar that is set out in that treaty, and therefore we have the legal basis to step out and help these regions: mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas. In the case of mountain regions – as has been said here – we are talking about 90 million inhabitants; in the case of islands, there are 21 million people living on islands in 14 countries, and many millions more live in mountain regions. All of these areas share a very similar set of problems in terms of culture, education, transport and the environment. Specifically, there is one disadvantage that unites us all, which is in terms of transport. I come from the Balearic Islands, where the additional cost of transport has been calculated at 20%. This undoubtedly has repercussions on our industry, agriculture, strategic sectors, tourism and, in short, on the whole business sector: the entire economic fabric. It therefore affects our competitiveness. Therefore, if we then focus on resources, such as drinking water or land, which is limited, or raw materials such as energy or the living spaces in those areas, we will see that they undoubtedly result in a phenomenon of shortages and of a lack of economic diversification. We are therefore calling for the new financial perspectives to take into account the specific characteristics of these areas and for us to move from words to action – as has also been said here – which should be translated into budgets, and hence into greater territorial cohesion. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

Madam President, Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives the European Union responsibility for economic, social and territorial cohesion, and for solidarity between the Member States. That cohesion and, in particular, territorial cohesion, is therefore one of the Union’s main objectives in order to ensure harmonious development and remove regional disparities. The Treaty of Lisbon also mentions supporting the island regions. I am speaking because the Spanish Government has announced a cut in the subsidy for discounting flights to the Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla for residents. In other words, it intends to cut into discounts for residents. Residents of these regions see air travel as essential. It is not optional, but rather they depend on it as it is their only means of contact with the outside world, and therefore maintaining discounts will ensure that those regions have equal opportunities and can compete. I ask Parliament to support this territorial cohesion and I trust that it will make the Spanish Government reconsider removing these discounts. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

 Mr President, we approved the Lisbon Agenda with its very ambitious objectives in 2000. Some of these have been met, but a lot of them have not. There is no doubt that the regional funds contributed to the Lisbon Strategy. Ten years on, we find ourselves shaken by the worst economic crisis we can remember. I believe that this crisis has served to enable us to identify, in this new Europe 2020 strategy, where we went wrong, as well as enable us to improve so as to achieve better results. Firstly, we have learned that coordination between all governance levels is essential, as is clearly stated in Mr Cortés Lastra’s report. We have also learned that the contribution of regional funds is essential to meeting the objectives we are proposing. We believe that the combination of specific actions at all levels – European Union, national, regional and local authorities – is an absolute necessity. If we work together, we will be much stronger. It is also important that a Cohesion policy covering economic, social and territorial aspects be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy. I would also like to make an observation as regards the Cohesion policy issue here, namely that the bureaucratic procedures should be much more flexible and efficient. Furthermore, in the disability sector, that difference will have to be taken into account in some way. Finally, I would like to underline the important role to be played by European regions and towns and cities, and especially, the need to pay more attention to those areas with special needs, such as mountain areas, coastal areas and islands. In short, if we want to be successful, we have to be able to count on the European regions, the towns and the cities and on a reformed Cohesion policy in line with the new situation.

 Mr President, the closure of a large part of European airspace over recent weeks following the eruption of the Icelandic volcano has had serious consequences for the entire European economy. This is clearly the case for the passengers, airlines and airports of the aviation sector, but it is also true for the tourism sector. That is what I wanted to talk to you about. In Spain, this is our second-largest industry. In the islands I hail from, it is the main industry. There is huge concern for the effects of the volcanic cloud on the tourist industry. There is talk of losses of EUR 42 million a day. It has dealt a serious blow to the tourism sector, which is still concerned about what the future repercussions may be. Mr Tajani, the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship, has committed himself to study the losses in this sector. My request today would be for an urgent relief package both for these airlines and for the other businesses in the tourism sector, and for the tourism sector to be treated as a priority.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor to highlight and condemn implementation of the Spanish Government’s Law on the Coastline, in particular, its effects on the island of Formentera. Formentera is one of the Balearic Islands. It is 19 kilometres long and has a perimeter of 69 kilometres. The implementation of this law will be positive in areas devastated by urban development. It will not, however, be beneficial for the island of Formentera, because it requires the elimination of most of the island’s tourist facilities, which means small family businesses will be seized. These facilities are the island’s livelihood and have been legally established for between 30 and 40 years. By way of example, I could mention the Hotel Rocabella, which was the first hotel on the island, or the bar and restaurant known as the Blue Bar, which is internationally renowned and has helped to promote the island abroad. Seventy per cent of these facilities would be affected by the implementation of the aforementioned law, despite having been established legally when they were set up. All this law would do would be to permit seizure. We therefore call for a fair demarcation system for the island of Formentera. I call on the Spanish Government to undertake a new demarcation, respecting private property, in line with the many rulings on the subject by the Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. Never again should a law like this one with retroactive effect be drawn up. It is causing a great deal of damage. In particular, it should be borne in mind that all these facilities were built with respect for the environment. Furthermore, the coast is protected under national and local legislation. It is not possible to build within 300 metres of the coast or to increase the amount of hotel accommodation. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate Mr Goerens on his excellent report. The Agenda for Change is an important roadmap for redefining development cooperation and for striving for better quality and effectiveness of aid, particularly in view of current changes in the new world order, the emergence of new international actors and the necessary process of fiscal consolidation into which we are forced by our current economic situation. We are pleased that the Commission is making poverty a core element of its differentiation policy. However, we deplore the fact that gross national income has been adopted as the key indicator for implementation of that policy. Mr President, 70 % of the people in this world whose income is below the poverty threshold live in middle-income countries. If we want to have a real impact on reducing this poverty, we need to take into account, in addition to wealth, other criteria such as the vulnerability of some of those countries, the lack of internal cohesion or the human development indicator. Many of these countries could also be key players today through triangular or South-South cooperation mechanisms, not to mention drivers of development for the future. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

 Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Cortés Lastra on his excellent report. Latin America is one of the regions of the world that has grown the most in recent years. As its largest global donor, the European Union has made a significant contribution to that development, and this is not the time to suddenly cut off our aid, but rather to do so gradually, so that those countries can consolidate their rule of law and continue to reduce their poverty figures. We need to maintain the levels of cooperation aid to Latin America as, despite achieving regional growth figures of more than 4%, it has the largest pockets of poverty in the world and the greatest levels of economic and social inequality. The European Union and Latin America share common values and interests and must move forward together in order to face up to the global challenges facing our societies, which are now more interdependent than ever.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the tragedy of Mali is the chronicle of a death foretold. One year ago, I had the honour of being the chief observer of an EU election observation mission in Niger; the Nigerien authorities – who knew exactly what they were talking about – and the few ambassadors posted there warned the European governments that there would be terrible consequences for all the Sahel countries if the Tuaregs, who formed part of Gaddafi’s army of mercenaries, returned. They said that those armed Tuaregs would unite, in particular, with their supporters in those countries and also with forces of the al-Qaeda organisation in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM); they also warned that AQIM had infiltrated the Libyan rebels. Baroness Ashton, I am very pleased about the measures you announced for all the Sahel countries, but I would just say that those measures need to be taken urgently and quickly because otherwise, we are going to be facing a truly pressing problem. Most of those countries could soon come under the control of the fundamentalist AQIM forces, all of which will be happening on Europe’s doorstep. I should not like to finish without mentioning all those people who have been abducted by AQIM, and I urge you to take all possible measures to bring about their swift liberation.

 Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Ms Vassiliou, my colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education and the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for the fruitful work we have done together over the past few months. Today the sports world is mourning those who died at a football match in Egypt. I would like to express my strong condemnation, and to remember the victims and their families. While drawing up this report I was in constant contact with the sports world, hearing people’s concerns and trying to reflect the issues on which the EU is being asked to express its opinion. The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has caused a revolution in the sports world because, for the first time, it was given its own legal basis, in Article 165. The first response to the Treaty was the Commission communication entitled ‘Developing the European Dimension in Sport’, which follows the guidelines set out in the 2007 White Paper. Parliament responded with an own-initiative report of the same name. The report was approved by the Committee on Culture and Education by 28 votes in favour and 2 votes against. I would like to highlight two concepts related to sport, of which I was very aware when writing the report. Firstly, the principle of subsidiarity, which recognises the competences of Member States and, secondly, the concept of the specific nature of sport, as mentioned in Article 165. However, this is not a universal principle, but rather one that must be analysed and approved on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the autonomy of governance structures in sport should be respected as a fundamental principle for its organisation. Allow me to briefly highlight some points made in the report. First of all, volunteering, when thousands of citizens selflessly take part to ensure that countless sporting events can be held. We must give them our unconditional support. Secondly, doping. Doping substances are a blight on sport and society. We should educate people on prevention, convict traffickers, pursue cheats and harmonise sanctions between sports law and civil law, maintaining the greatest possible respect for sportspeople. The report urges Member States to treat trafficking in illegal substances in the same way as trafficking in illegal drugs and to adopt national legislation to this end. It is vital to support the practice of sport in schools, and we therefore call for sport to be part of their curriculum. At some point, sportspeople’s professional careers come to an end, and during their career they need to have access to high-quality academic training in order to later become integrated into the world of work. Unfortunately, racism, xenophobia and homophobia are present in sport, and it is therefore necessary to implement new measures to eliminate any signs of those threats at sporting events. I would like to stress the undeniable benefit that sport has on people’s health, leading to a significant reduction in public health spending. I would also highlight the importance of sport as a means of integration for the most vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and socially excluded groups, as well as for those with disabilities. Betting should be protected from unauthorised activities, and from suspected match fixing, in particular by recognising organisers’ property rights with regard to their competitions. The report also calls on Member States to take legal action against sports fraud. It is fundamentally important that commercial exploitation of audiovisual rights for sport competitions should be carried out on a centralised, territorial basis with a view to guaranteeing that revenues are distributed fairly between elite and mass-participation sport. I would like to draw attention to the proposal to establish a European Day of Sports and an Erasmus Sports Programme, and to protect indigenous sports as part of our cultural heritage. These are just a few of the issues dealt with in the report, and I hope I can count on Parliament’s support. Santiago Fisas Ayxela,  
rapporteur. – (ES) 
Mr President, I should like to thank all the Members who have spoken in this sitting. I am not going to waste a second refuting some of the lies that have been told today. Whoever is able to read should simply read the report. I would, however, like to finish by stressing the importance of sport for a variety of vital social issues such as the integration of the most vulnerable groups, public health, education, employment and the economy. We should remember that sport in Europe represents, whether directly or indirectly, 15 million jobs – that is, 5.4% of the active population – and an annual added value of EUR 407 billion, which is 3.65% of European GDP. For this reason, because sport is so important, I welcome the Commission’s initiative and support, and I would also venture to ask the Commissioner whether Structural Funds could be applied specifically to sport. Above all, I would like to thank the main political groups in this House for their support. Thanks to the support shown by those groups, I hope that this report will be adopted in tomorrow’s vote.

 Madam President, fortunately the Libyan opposition has successfully confronted Muammar Gaddafi’s dictatorship, with the help of the international community. Now Gaddafi must be caught and judged for the crimes, violations of human rights, and possible crimes against humanity that he may have committed. The most important thing of all at the moment is to focus our efforts on rebuilding the country and endeavour to help Libya become a democratic state based on the rule of law. There are certain vital elements for ensuring the country is secure and viable: establishing the normal functioning of infrastructures, particularly where water, electricity and oil are concerned; maintaining public order by means of a police force; and effectively collecting all the weapons that have been distributed throughout the country. We should also remember the importance of supporting the Sahel countries: on the one hand, to avoid the extremely serious consequences for their security if mercenaries return and pro-Gaddafi forces flee to those countries; on the other hand, to support their institutions, which are enabling displaced persons from Libya to make an orderly return to their homes. Finally, I believe that the deployment of a United Nations mission to the country would be key to achieving the objectives mentioned. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

Madam President, Lady Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to refer to the case of Libya in particular. Among all the Maghreb countries, the situation of Libya seems to me especially worrying since it is at the gates of Europe and has abundant oil reserves. We have been at war a long time and the situation appears to be stagnating. I believe that the EU should do everything possible to achieve two objectives: that Colonel Gaddafi leaves the country and, also, that Libya enjoys a stable situation and becomes a democratic state, and does not run the risk of degenerating into a failed state which could be infiltrated by al-Qaeda, which would be a very dangerous and worrying situation for Europe. Furthermore, an ungovernable state, the massive return of emigrants to their countries of origin and, above all, of armed Tuaregs, could cause a conflict situation in the neighbouring countries. Libya is an Arab state but, above all, it is an African state, and I think it is very important to take into account the opinion of the neighbouring states of the Sahel in connection with this country’s situation. If we are not capable of getting rid of Gaddafi and bringing this war to an end, maybe these countries have proposals that we should listen to. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

Mr President, as you know, Niger, one of the central countries of the Sahel region, is holding presidential and parliamentary elections at the end of this month. I think that Baroness Ashton’s decision to send a European Union delegation to those elections is an important gesture of support, and I want to thank her for thinking of me to chair it. I would first of all like to express my regret at the recent murder of two young French people in Niger at the hands of terrorists, not forgetting the Nigerien soldiers who died during the rescue operation. The population of the region clearly rejects violence and terrorism, as they are the first to suffer as a result, but they ask the European Union to do everything it can to help them to eradicate terrorist violence and, among other things, to provide weapons and training for their armed forces so that they can respond adequately to these terrorist incursions. In addition, despite having a great wealth of natural resources, Niger is one of the least developed countries in the world. The European Union must therefore work to establish an effective development cooperation strategy to help Niger and the whole region out of the difficult situation they are in. I think there is a great deal at stake for us in this area of the world, because it is not only its welfare, but that of Europe that is dependent on its stability, given its geographical proximity.

Madam President, thousands of Saharans left their cities and peacefully set up the Gdaim Izyk camp in order to demand better living conditions. The Moroccan security forces violently dismantled the camp and, as a result, serious riots broke out in Al Aaiún. The Moroccan armed forces killed a young Saharan, and a Spanish citizen died in unclear circumstances. There are currently no reliable figures regarding the number of deaths, injuries, disappearances or arrests during those riots. Moreover, numerous MEPs have been banned from entering the Sahara, along with journalists who are still having serious problems doing their work. Morocco is Europe’s friend and strategic ally, and it is not good to have doubts or misunderstandings between friends. If Morocco has nothing to hide, it must allow the clarification of what happened. Therefore, although it is true that the Moroccan Parliament has set up an investigative commission, I think it is essential that an international commission be set up, that European and politicians and journalists have freedom of access to the area and that the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara extend its mandate to the protection of human rights, both in the area controlled by Morocco and in the area controlled by Polisario. The Commission and the European governments, least of all the Spanish Government, cannot look the other way in response to this situation. Realpolitik
 must not be an excuse for turning a blind eye. They must request clarification regarding these serious events and ask Morocco and the Polisario to resume discussions as soon as possible in order to arrive at a peaceful agreement on the basis of the United Nations resolutions.

 Madam President, Judge Afiuni granted parole to Eligio Cedeño, in accordance with Venezuelan law and in line with the opinion of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions. This led to her incarceration in a maximum-security prison, in conditions that are putting her life in danger. President Chávez has publicly requested that the prosecutor seek the maximum penalty, and that the National Assembly pass a law to increase her sentence with retroactive effect. Amnesty International and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have indicated their great concern. This is not an isolated case, ladies and gentlemen. On the contrary, it demonstrates the autocratic and authoritarian drift of a regime that, alongside seemingly democratic elections, closes opposing media, orders confiscations and arrests political opponents, showing no respect for human rights and the rule of law.

 Mr President, the Sagrada Familia, 
the work of the brilliant, Catalonian architect, Antoni Gaudí, is a genuine icon of Barcelona throughout the world. It was declared to be a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) in 2005. Work is currently being done on the high-speed train that will cross the city by means of a tunnel that lies a mere four metres from the foundations of the Sagrada Familia. There are 38 technical reports opposing these works. The International Council on Monuments and Sites, a specialist Unesco body, has expressed its concern about the route. Moreover, the lower house of the Spanish Parliament adopted a motion on 22 June to ask for a precautionary suspension of the works and the setting up of a committee of experts that could propose another solution within a time limit of two months. I would like to ask what measures the Commission is going to take to preserve a building as emblematic as is Barcelona’s Sagrada Familia against the risk represented by the passing of the high-speed train?

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against poverty and the other Millennium Development Goals should unite us all. I therefore regret the fact that some political groups have introduced certain issues that might make it difficult to achieve that unanimity. They are moral issues, such as proposing abortion as a method of birth control, or economic issues, such as introducing a tax on currency transactions. I think that this tax would be very difficult to implement, control and collect, and if it were not adopted across the board, especially in the main financial blocks, transactions would be moved to the countries where it was not in force. I regret that the report, which contains many positive points, will not receive unanimous support from all the political groups because of these particular issues. Santiago Fisas Ayxela,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mexico has a major problem with drugs trafficking and drug-related violence. To address this situation, the Government of President Felipe Calderón has adopted a tough stance in order to achieve its eradication: he has taken the decision to temporarily mobilise the armed forces, a move which has had a significant impact on the number of people arrested, the destruction of drugs and the confiscation of weapons. The army has accepted all the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission, including those concerning the investigation of complaints about their own conduct. The Government also recognises that it needs to make substantial changes in the area of security and justice, and is implementing an ambitious reform of the justice system in order for it to be more transparent and to bring to justice those who commit crimes, while respecting human rights. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wishes to show its solidarity with the Mexican people in the fight against drugs trafficking, and we support President Calderón in his willingness to combat organised crime. Finally, I would like to express my satisfaction with this agreement, which unites the main political Groups of this Parliament. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, today is a very important day for all victims, particularly victims of terrorism, because on 11 September 2001, more than 3 000 innocent people died in several terrorist attacks in the United States. We cannot forget those who died in London and Madrid, or the many victims of terrorism in Europe, such as those of the ETA terrorist organisation in Spain, my country. Society as a whole is the victim in a terrorist attack, but a few citizens pay with their lives to defend our freedom. That is why, Mr President, I am dedicating part of my speaking time, including the time I have been allocated at the end of the debate, to observe one minute’s silence for all of these victims. (The House observed a minute’s silence)
 I should like to thank Commissioner Reding for the sensitivity she has shown towards victims, also the Council for its flexibility, and Ms Parvanova for her excellent work, as well as the Members of Parliament who have followed this report. Tomorrow will be crucial not only for victims but for all citizens, and believe me when I say that anyone can become a victim, as we can see from this compelling statistic: 75 million people a year are victims of crime in Europe. I believe it is time to give the victims the place they deserve, that is, at the centre of our debates in Parliament, because, even though the economic situation is our main concern today, I know that in most European countries, people are extremely worried about the way the justice system functions. This directive, which sends a clear message to victims that their rights will not be ignored and that they will be treated with respect and dignity, will serve to build people’s confidence in justice. The response to victims’ call for justice begins in Europe: a transparent and effective framework that restores citizens’ rights and the hope they have lost, in some cases, in their judicial system. Irrespective of their nationality or the place where the crime was committed, the victims will have the right to be informed, to understand and be understood, to legal counsel, and to be heard and protected. Victim support services will be able to provide psychological support and defend the victims at all times. I have heard many victims’ accounts, all of which were very traumatic, but necessary in order to understand the needs of the different types of victims; I would like to add that I dedicate this directive to them, especially to my brother, Alberto, and his wife, who will be looking down on me from heaven. In Parliament today, we are taking an important first step towards helping a father who has lost his son in another country, the victim of an attack, or a girl who has been raped and has no idea where to begin or what to tell the police. They are forced to go through that nightmare, and we are helping all of them here today. I hope this compass guides not only victims when they are crossing the desert of criminal proceedings, but also all those who must support them on their path of pain, such as judges, police officers and legal experts, including in cases involving children, and I also dedicate this directive to them. Today is a very important day for all victims: victims of gender violence, people trafficking, terrorism, organised crime, as well as child victims, victims with disabilities, and all those who have experienced the ordeal of a crime. Unfortunately, we cannot bring back people’s loved ones, nor can we restore their honour, the peace of mind they have lost, or their health, but all of us here today can promise them that we shall continue working towards giving them back their rights, dignity and belief in justice. I am committing myself and I call on the whole of Parliament to do the same with me tomorrow. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur. 
– (ES) 
Mr President, I should like once more to thank all those who have made it possible for this directive to become a reality: the secretariat, the Commission, the rapporteur, all those I am forgetting to mention and all my fellow Members who have supported us. I should like to say to every single victim without exception that, for us, they and their families have faces, names and are real people, and it is specifically on their behalf that we will work to ensure this directive is truly effective and – with the commitment and support of Commissioner Reding, of which I have no doubt whatsoever – is quickly and efficiently implemented, which is what all of us, and all citizens, want. I think there are various victims’ associations that would have wanted, and continue to want, their own directive, but I will make sure they know that the directive we shall vote on tomorrow does not overlook a single victim and, therefore, does not overlook them either. I am certain that this is the first important step and that it will be followed by many other steps that will open the doors of justice, which have been closed to victims for too long. When I am asked, as I often am in my country, what I do in Europe, I will be able to say with great pride that I am legislating in support of victims. That work is a great honour to me personally, and it motivates me to continue working. I am sure that, with the support and commitment of all those who are not only working here in the EU but also in our own countries, as well as your support, ladies and gentlemen, together we will succeed in putting an end to the situation of unjust neglect in which victims find themselves. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 Madam President, I have been denouncing female genital mutilation since I became a Member of Parliament. This silent and accepted crime is suffered by millions of women and girls throughout the world: 70 million, I repeat, 70 million. An unbearable figure for those who stop to examine the terrible consequences of these practices, hidden under the guises of psychological, health, and religious reasons, all of which are false. The truth is that circumcision, preferentially practised on 14-year-old girls, and even those aged one year old, can lead to death by haemorrhagic shock and, at best, cause and bring about strong psychological consequences from the trauma. We should strive with all our efforts in Europe to eradicate this violation of human rights, which infringes on the right to equal opportunities and puts health at risk. It is, ladies and gentlemen, abuse, cruelty and torture against girls, and this degrading treatment also occurs in Europe. We must therefore activate all the available prevention mechanisms in our legal system and encourage our judges to act to prevent the genital mutilation of girls in Europe, punishing those who carry it out. EU law has to speak with a single voice to combat the mutilation on our soil. Lastly, I call on civil society and NGOs to become actively involved in education and prevention campaigns. There is still a long way to go, but we are a large group who will not give up, as we owe it to the 70 million mutilated women. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 Madam President, from the European Parliament I wish to pay tribute to all women today because, despite the fact that we have made much progress since March 1911, when women took to the streets to demand the vote and better working conditions, I think that women’s equality is still a long way away. Today women can work without having to get permission from anyone but, in many cases, they continue to earn less than men for similar work, which is unacceptable. We must also remember women in rural areas, whose work goes unnoticed. I think that another uncomfortable truth, but one which we must continue to denounce, is violence against women. This year alone an excessive number of women have already been murdered, leaving aside serious threats from those who believe they have the right to perpetrate physical or psychological violence against women. It is time to say enough and to say it loud and clear. From this Parliament I reiterate my commitment to the European protection order for victims and to the Directive on the rights of victims which the Commission put forward and which will be voted upon next June, God willing. It also has to be said, and I should like to remind people, that motherhood is still an obstacle to the progression of women and I think this is a trend that should be changed. I want to send a message of hope: many women, with the help of more and more men, need to advance along the path of equal opportunities, rights and responsibilities. We have come a long way but there is a lot left to do. I have to admit that I do not believe in quotas in any way, shape or form but I must say that something has to be done and I agree with many of you and, of course, with Ms Reding, in opening this debate and advancing along that path so that women regain the place that they deserve and to that end you can count on my support. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur. 
– (ES)
 Madam President, I am pleased to know that the European protection order will be put to the vote and, in all probability, ratified by a large majority in this Chamber tomorrow. I say that from the heart as, since I entered this Parliament, I have been loyal in my commitment to the victims in defence of their rights, and one of the basic rights of any victim is to be suitably protected. My commitment extends to all citizens, as we are all potential victims of crime and we have the need to be able to live in a world and a European area of freedom, justice and security. With your votes in favour, we will be legislating to make life easier for the victims, who will feel equally protected in any country of the European Union going forward, without the need to initiate a new legal procedure with every move. In summary, we will make it easier for the victims to move around and we will limit their aggressors’ movements, which I consider to be a big step forward that I am delighted to have been able to make as the rapporteur for this report. The time is already upon us to stop allowing crime to cross borders, placing our lives at risk. We have the right and duty to protect ourselves, and this tool will serve that purpose. Despite the difficulties and the path we have taken during these two years of negotiations, which has not always been smooth, I want to thank the Polish Presidency today for having skilfully driven the negotiations. I also want to thank the Commission which, thanks to the vision of Ms Reding on presenting the legislative package relative to the victims and an additional regulation in civil law, has finally managed to dispel the Council’s doubts about the convenience of supporting the European protection order, along with opening the door to more wide-ranging legislation for the rights of the victims of crime and their support, on which I am working with a great deal of hope. I want to thank my co-rapporteur, Ms Romero, and also the Secretariat. When we return to our countries and people ask us ‘What do you do over there in Europe?’, given that they view our work as so distant and incomprehensible, this time I will be able to tell them that we have at least created an instrument, which we have ratified in this parliamentary session, which will protect so many people that suffer violence. I offer this future law for the many women killed through male violence, the many innocent people that suffer human trafficking without the possibility of escaping from their aggressors, the many defenceless children, the victims of terrorism that live with their terror, those that run from organised crime, and the many that don’t know where to go for fear of being pursued. We have taken a big step today towards the defence and protection of those that are most in need. I would like to conclude my speech with three words that are the guiding light in my work and life: freedom, justice and dignity. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur. 
– (ES)
 Madam President, I think it is very important to closely follow the application of the European protection order. We refer to filing a report, but these reports should be followed by real protection. We need troops: we can approve good laws, but if we do not provide countries with the necessary means, the victims will not feel confident and they will continue to keep quiet for fear of being assaulted again. Therefore, it is necessary that the judges and the police have the training and means to be able to do their job properly. That is real justice. So many victims complain about the application of a law that does not meet their needs. It is necessary, therefore, that we pool our efforts, that we insist on the statistics to see how this instrument is working, which I believe is really necessary. I ask the Member States to make the effort to understand and apply this regulation, as that’s what we have worked for, and we consider that we have made it clear. I think that from now on, the doors to victim rights are wide open in Europe, that women and men can count on this, and other instruments, which will make victims come forward and put a stop to those that they fear. Today through our voices, and tomorrow through our votes, we will tell the victims that we will never forget their rights in the European Parliament, the support that society owes them, and mostly importantly, justice. I can tell you that it is justice that keeps all the victims alive, regardless of the crime committed against them. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
).

 Madam President, as rapporteur of the report on the drafting of a directive on the rights of victims of crimes, including terrorism, and as a Spaniard who has personally suffered the cruelty of the terrorist organisation ETA, I would like to thank President Buzek for his support for my country and its victims. I understand the pleasure that many people feel at this new statement from ETA, but I must remind you that it is still too soon to celebrate, because they have not yet handed over their weapons, nor disbanded, nor asked their victims for forgiveness. Ladies and gentlemen, it is also important for you to realise that we do not have to reach any kind of peace between the two sides in Spain, because there has not been a war. My brother, Alberto Jiménez-Becerril, who was murdered by ETA along with his wife in Seville, was not returning from war. He was going home, where his three children, who would never see him again, were waiting for him. We have the obligation to tell my brother’s children that his parents were better than their murderers. If we accept an end without winners or losers, we will be showing these children that you can achieve political objectives by killing. So I ask Parliament not to allow itself to be hoodwinked by the ETA terrorists and their accomplices, and to listen to the sincere voices of the victims. The only thing they want is the peace that comes from justice. (Applause) Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I would like to say to everyone that there is only one kind of terrorism, simply that which destroys innocent lives. Where it comes from is not an issue. The victims of terrorism, whom I represent, given that the ETA terrorist organisation killed my brother and his wife, share a common thread, and on their behalf, I would like to say that this report, with such a long title, could have been ambitious, but it is not. It is a disappointing outcome. This report does not represent us, it does not represent hopes for justice, or the balance between freedom and security that we talk about so much here. It does not represent us, and I believe that a report on terrorism should acknowledge the victims of terrorism, but this does not. Therefore, I ask you to vote against this report. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 Mr President, in defence of fundamental rights, I call on the responsible institutions to review the designation of San Sebastián as European Capital of Culture, because I believe that it was chosen on the basis of political criteria, which constitutes discrimination against the other candidate cities. The chairman of the panel said the city was chosen to support the peace process but, as far as I am aware, there is a terrorist organisation in Spain, called ETA, that so far has not laid down its weapons and which two months ago managed to get its political wing, Bildu, into government in San Sebastián, as well as other towns. I do not believe that Europe should be giving such a powerful megaphone to people who fail to condemn terrorist violence and who will create propaganda out of apportioning blame between victims and murderers. Where is the right to freedom and dignity? Clearly not in San Sebastián, where our fellow Members such as Mayor Oreja, Mr Iturgaiz, Mr Zalba, and I myself have to go around with bodyguards. I believe in the culture of life, not in a bullet to the back of the head. Ladies and gentlemen, can there be any true culture without freedom? No, a thousand times no. San Sebastián should once again submit its candidacy when it is a city that is free for everyone. In the meantime, they should learn the culture of respect towards those who think differently, because although the city may deserve the title in future, today, with Batasuna and its successors in its institutions, it does not. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
).

Mr President, the most important thing, and that which is uniting us here today, are the victims, because nobody should feel as unprotected as we, the European consumers, feel at the moment. Furthermore, we need clarity and responsibility in respect of the victims. It is my responsibility to denounce the German authorities, who, wrongly and hastily, accused Spanish cucumbers and, more specifically, the cooperatives of Malaga and Almeria, which were model operations and which will not recover from these accusations. Thousands of jobless families are wondering why – and they need an answer – and, in particular, they want to know what the future holds for them, not just in Andalusia, but throughout European agriculture. Therefore, and in the hope that the experts will soon find the solution, I demand that today, when the Commission speaks to the Council, it asks for immediate and moral economic measures for all the producers from Andalusia and from the whole of Europe, who are looking towards us with indignation, but also with hope. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, on most occasions that I have spoken in Parliament, it has been to denounce violence against women, and I am here again to combat it. I must say that not only do I not tire of doing this, but I think that it is essential to continue to speak out in public about this violation of human rights, as you cannot defend a cause without a sounding board. Furthermore, this Parliament is the best loudspeaker available to me to defend all those women who suffer daily from abuse and who need us, as legislators, to compel the Member States to punish the perpetrators of this aggression in a manner that befits the seriousness of the crime, and also to provide assistance to the victims. When, according to estimates, one in four women in Europe has suffered gender violence at least once in her life, and the same proportion of children, I believe that we cannot but demand greater commitment, as has been recognised by the Commission in its action plan. I believe that we must keep on insisting, time and time again, in order to protect victims, as we did with the European Protection Order, for which I was rapporteur, and I hope that it will come into effect as soon as possible. This report has benefited from a great measure of consensus and support from the outset. This shows that when we tackle domestic violence, which affects all family members, including children, the elderly, women and men, this should not provide the opportunity for political opportunism, as it does us all great credit to be making progress towards finding a solution to this scourge of our society. The first thing we must do is to speak up, and the second is to get down to work, for, although we have spent decades speaking about gender violence, we have not managed to reduce the number of deaths. We must be doing something wrong, and therefore, it is time to leave demagogy aside and to move from words to actions. We must give more genuine assistance and apply the legislation that women need if they are to live in dignity and safety. I want all the victims to know that I shall always be here to speak up for them, until the day that, by working together, we manage to defeat this terrible enemy, which sadly ends the lives of so many innocent victims. What I say is: we have had enough. It cannot go on. I ask all of you to say likewise. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, today is a very significant day to talk about equality between men and women because we are celebrating International Women’s Day, remembering those who fought for women’s working and economic rights and their right to vote 100 years ago. We have made considerable progress in those 100 years, but much remains to be done. True equality is still a dream and discrimination against women is a fact of life. I believe that every one of us, both men and women, can do a lot more to achieve true emancipation for women. There are many women in the world whose right to life is being threatened, whose dignity is being violated, and whose freedom is being denied. Allow me, on this International Women’s Day, to demonstrate my support and hope to all women fighting for their democratic rights in the revolution in North Africa. Women cannot be worth half what men are in Arab counties or anywhere in the world. We are worth the same and deserve the same. I will continue fighting to achieve that equality and International Women’s Day will continue to exist until it is achieved. Even if there are many who do not want to see it, the reality is that there are women who earn half of what men do and that domestic violence mainly affects women and children. I must repeat that these facts must continue to be reported in Parliament, and I promise to continue working toward that, of course. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, while not wishing to take the comparison between terrorism and immigration too far, I have observed that unfortunately, EU action is driven by emergency situations, such as a serious attack or a mass landing of immigrants, as is currently happening in Lampedusa, where the exodus of Tunisians to the Italian coast could culminate in a chronicle of a death foretold. The voyage of hope could end up becoming a cursed voyage, and it will be on the consciences of all of us who witness these continuous uncontrolled influxes and do not say ‘enough is enough’ with sufficient authority. When it happens, we will throw up our hands in horror, but the following day we will forget about it. Europeans have a duty and a right to know the truth: that the Mediterranean strategy is not working, that the common immigration policy will continue to be a dream until European countries commit to equipping the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) with sufficient resources to be effective. Talking does not cost anything, but we need to act. Do you really believe that Frontex is currently able to guarantee the security of the European borders? I do not believe it is. Let us hope that the people of Egypt, Tunisia and other countries of the Maghreb do not decide en masse
 to seek a better future in Europe, but rather that they do so in their own countries, because that is what they have fought for, and we must help them. Solidarity and responsibility are therefore required, along with, above all, truth when talking about a common European immigration policy, which is now more necessary than ever. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES) 
Mr President, today is an important day for all victims, because today we shall adopt the European Protection Order, which is a significant step forward in terms of their rights. Victims are unfairly forgotten about, and it is paradoxical that aggressors often have many more rights and that there is more said about aggressors’ rights than victims’ rights. Today, Parliament will honour all victims, reminding those who believe that the borders will shield them while they persecute their victims, that this European Protection Order will protect all victims equally in the European Union from this day onwards. We started working more than a year ago to achieve this objective and make progress with the area of freedom and security that was mentioned in the Stockholm Programme, and today we can say with a degree of pride that, although the path has not been easy, as many people have frequently failed to understand the order, and doubted its effectiveness and clarity, we have achieved it. I must say that, following the trialogues with the Belgian Presidency, and many conversations with the Commission, we have achieved a text that almost all the political groups were happy with. This report was therefore adopted by a huge majority with no votes against in the joint vote by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. I hope that today, Parliament will reflect the decision made by those committees and by those of us who produced this report, which was adopted by a huge majority. This would send a clear message to the Council about what Europeans want, which is nothing more than to live in an area of security and justice, to be protected, and for a victim who has a restraining order against her aggressor in her country not to have to begin further court proceedings when she moves to another country. We have an obligation to facilitate access to justice for Europeans, and especially for victims, who are the most vulnerable. The protection of all victims, without exception, has been my beacon throughout the development of this report. I therefore wanted to include victims of terrorism, people trafficking, organised crime and honour crimes, along with a special chapter for minors, who are the most vulnerable victims, and we never think about how to protect them. Although this order will protect all victims, women who suffer from domestic violence will benefit most from this instrument for judicial cooperation, as their aggressors will not be able to travel through Europe with impunity, and will know that they will be pursued in the same way as in the country where they attacked their partners. Parliament must therefore send a clear message to the Council today about what we want. We will therefore vote with our eyes fixed on the victims, on those who suffer, on those who need us to protect them, on those who are afraid and need to live in freedom and hope. We are not going to give up on such a fair and necessary aim that is supported by the majority of Europeans just because there are some who are afraid and never dare to take that one step further. We need to be brave, the Member States need to be brave, and I hope that the vote today will be a majority in favour and encourage those who still have doubts as to whether this instrument will open a door for victims. I also hope that in the near future, the Commission will put forward wide-ranging legislation in favour of victims’ rights, for which it has my full support and, I am sure, Parliament’s support. I repeat: this small but major step that is the European Protection Order will improve protection for all victims, preventing further crimes and relieving the consequences of those that have already been committed. Today, we have an obligation to remove the obstacles that have so far prevented real protection across Europe. Through our vote today, we have the opportunity to save lives, which is what we are going to do, and we should be genuinely proud of that. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES) 
Madam President, I think that in this debate, we have clearly seen that we are all in agreement in supporting the objective of this report. The various political groups have shown their support for this directive, which offers greater protection to victims. My question is, therefore: what obstacles are there to adopting this instrument? I repeat: what fears are there regarding something as essential and simple as protecting victims equally across Europe finally becoming a reality? In the hope that Parliament will adopt this report by a majority, I would like to address the Council and the Commission to remind them that we have overcome the legal hurdles in our negotiations, and I welcome the fact that the Commission acknowledges our work, just as we acknowledge the work that it will do in the future. We should not therefore exclude ourselves, but rather help ourselves by adopting this more specific instrument today, and tomorrow by adopting the broader package of measures to help victims that will be presented by the Commission, with which I promise to cooperate. Let us therefore be brave and responsible, and let us help all those who have the right to live in a safer Europe. I repeat: let us help everyone, be they men, women or children. Let us help those who are looking to us today to give them a better life, a life that will restore to them their freedom, their security and, above all, their dignity. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I have asked for the floor to remind you of the importance of today’s vote in order to send a clear message to the Council, aimed at the countries that have still not equipped themselves with security in this field. I believe that today, we have an opportunity to defend victims and ensure that they can live without fear and in freedom. It is very important, not only for women, but also for men, children, victims of terrorism, victims of organised crime, victims of trafficking of women and for victims in general. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Mr President, last month, I organised a hearing in this Parliament concerning the victims of terrorism, which was attended by the President of Parliament and various Members of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). The victims have turned to us, as their representatives in Europe, to guarantee them their right to justice which has been trampled on so many times in their own countries, such as Spain, where the Rodríguez Zapatero Government continues to lie to the Spanish people about a negotiation process with a terrorist group which has still not relinquished its arms. It is because of this that such grave incidents as the Bar Faisán
 tip off, in which the terrorists were warned of the operation in progress to arrest them, have still not been thoroughly investigated. Democratic governments cannot turn their backs on the victims of terrorism; they have already paid the highest price in the fight for liberty. Parliament must push for a European Charter which recognises the legitimate demands of the victims, such as not negotiating with terrorists and ensuring that they serve their prison sentences in full. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Human Rights, as a Spanish and European citizen, and as a victim of terrorism since the terrorist organisation ETA murdered my brother and his wife in Seville, I am speaking here today to condemn the fact that the Venezuelan Government and its President has allowed ETA terrorists to train on Venezuelan soil on the orders of the alleged terrorist, Arturo Cubillas, who works for Hugo Chávez’s government despite the fact that there is an international warrant out for his arrest; this is a serious violation of the fundamental right to all European citizens’ right to security. I demand firm action from the Spanish Government in response to this serious humiliation of all the Spanish people. Mr Zapatero cannot continue to keep quiet while the Venezuelan Ambassador describes the members of our Civil Guard, who have been, and will continue to be, models of bravery in the fight against ETA, as torturers. Nor can he look the other way as cooperation on Venezuelan soil between ETA and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia grows, which has already been condemned by the Judge Eloy Velasco. Mr Zapatero cannot shake the hand of a leader such as Mr Chávez, who is turning Venezuela into a haven for terrorists. The Prime Minister of a country such as Spain, where terrorism has caused so much pain, cannot continue to ignore this problem and should give the response that such a situation deserves, which is what any ordinary citizen would do if they had the opportunity. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity in this House today, as I was unable to do so on the ‘European Day for the Victims of Terrorism’ on 11 March, to pay a well-deserved tribute to these victims in recognition of the enormous sacrifice made by those who have paid the ultimate price in the name of freedom. We urgently need to start to work on a directive to protect the rights of the victims of terrorism, who are always the ones who are overlooked and who suffer the humiliation of being unjustly equated with their murderers. It is high time that we within these European institutions recognise the dignity of the victims of terrorism, and help to defend their right to protection and justice. This right should soon be embodied in a law that honours all those who make this possible, whose first article should state that support to victims of terrorism entails recognition of their right to justice and that no government should ever pay a price for this. I call on all those in a position to defend the victims never to forget that true peace is a peace born of justice, and that is the only peace that those of us who believe in freedom and democracy in Europe and anywhere else in the world should defend.

Mr President, I would like to say that I did not come to Parliament to applaud the brand new law in Spain on abortion. What I am concerned about is human life, and I am particularly concerned about the women – who I am here to defend – whose lives are in danger as a result of gender violence, and I am here to offer them a space in which they can live freely and safely. Parliament’s Resolution of 2 February 2006 recommended that the Member States adopt an attitude of zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women, and that they adopt the necessary measures to ensure better protection for victims. The Stockholm Programme, which was adopted in this House, established an area of freedom, justice and security for all European citizens, and combating gender violence was considered to be a priority in that programme. This reflected my request for the Spanish Presidency to promote a European protection order for the victims of gender violence during its mandate, to ensure that the victims of these crimes have the same level of protection in all the Member States. In a Europe without borders, the fight against gender violence should also be without borders, and the Member States should work hard to harmonise their legislation so that the fight against ill-treatment of women overcomes the legislative obstacles in its way and we can finally protect the lives of women and their children, at least within the European Union, I therefore ask the Commission and the Council to do everything that is necessary and everything in their power to move forward with the European protection order for victims, which is a very effective instrument for ensuring that those who fail to respect the dignity of women and their right to live freely and safely do not go unpunished.

Mr President, when dealing with a topic as serious as terrorism, we should not wait for things to happen before we act. We should anticipate events, but we do not. Unfortunately, we only change in response to each attack, such as the failed attack in Detroit, which is forcing us today to take decisions to ensure the safety of air transport. Taking a decision on body scanners in airports is a responsibility that we cannot avoid, ladies and gentlemen. We cannot wait any longer because the terrorists are not waiting. Consequently, the Commission must guarantee, as soon as possible, that the dignity and privacy of individuals will be preserved and that there will be no harmful effects on health. Once this is guaranteed, we must adopt decisions for the European Union as a whole. To those who are worried about infringement of our fundamental rights, I say that there is no greater right than the right to life, and those of us who cherish freedom above all else must be able to live safely in order to feel truly free.

 According to a United Nations report, in 2009, some 270 000 people were victims of human trafficking within the European Union. With these figures in mind, we need to ensure that European Union action is based, first and foremost, on victim protection, with special focus on the situation of women and children, who are the most vulnerable. We cannot continue to stand by and remain indifferent to the play that is being enacted, to the sideshow of sexual exploitation that is unfolding before our eyes. For this reason, I completely support the Parliament’s demands that victim assistance should be unconditional and that more forceful methods and more severe penalties should be adopted, as Mr Barrot has just told us. Having said that, I would like to call on the Spanish Presidency, the European Commission and the Council to use all the European legislation at their disposal, both existing and future legislation, to protect the victims of human trafficking. I consider that the proposed European victim protection system, which I personally demanded from the Spanish Presidency during the Stockholm Programme debates, and which has finally come to fruition, will be an effective instrument for fighting such crimes. I hope for a firm undertaking, as we have already seen, from the Spanish Presidency, to ensure that this system offers victims special protective measures that will be effective throughout the European Union. I hope that we who are responsible for taking action against the most severe problems in our society will come up with a real and substantial response to this extremely severe problem of human trafficking and that our words will not be empty promises. We really owe it to all the victims. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to say that the majority of governments and citizens only remember the victims of terrorism after a serious attack such as the ones in Madrid, New York or London. Once the wave of emotion has passed, they tend to forget about the terrorist threat and the rights of victims. Today, however, there is no doubt about the European Union’s commitment to the fight against terrorism. As Commissioner Barrot has just told us, this commitment has also been reflected in the recently adopted Stockholm Programme, which recognises the courage and dignity of the victims and the need to defend their rights. Despite this progress, the fight against terrorism has always been based on trust and mutual cooperation between the Member States. Taking into account the perspective offered by the Treaty of Lisbon, I wonder whether it would be a good idea for the European Union to promote harmonisation of the legislation of the Member States on the rights of victims of terrorism. The adoption of a European charter of the rights of victims of terrorism would be a big step forward that would help those fighting terrorism and would be a strong blow for those that defend it. It is the courage and dignity of the victims that is the greatest failure of terrorism and therefore the greatest triumph of democracy. We should never forget that the only weapon that innocent victims have against terrorism is their word and the recognition of society. Therefore, you should also not forget, ladies and gentlemen, that none of us are safe from being victims of terrorism. My question is, therefore: would the Commission agree with adopting a European charter to recognise the defence of the rights of the victims of terrorism and to promote those rights? If so, what measures would the new Commission take to drive forward this Charter under its new mandate? Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, today there is no doubt about the European Union’s commitment to the fight against terrorism, and thanks to the Stockholm Programme, we will continue to make progress on this essential area of freedom, security and justice. In my view, this fight has been based on mutual trust between the Member States, but now, with the possibilities opened up by the Treaty of Lisbon, it is high time to harmonise national legislation so that there is no time limit on prosecuting terrorist crimes, which should be considered as crimes against humanity. When this happens, nobody in this Parliament or in any other will defend terrorists, as has happened, is happening and may continue to happen, to the detriment of victims of terrorism, who watch those who murdered their loved ones being treated like heroes, while they suffer in silence. I therefore ask Parliament to drive forward or adopt a European charter for the rights of the victims of terrorism, based on defending the memory… (The President cut off the speaker) Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate you as the Commission’s proposal on the employment package is very important. It is an ambitious and difficult challenge in the context of the current crisis, but we have to achieve the objective of the Europe 2020 strategy and create new jobs. To achieve this objective, the job markets need to be reformed so that they are more dynamic and inclusive, with workers trained in appropriate skills so they are more resistant to economic adjustment processes, and make full use of their potential for job creation during growth periods. Hiring needs to be stimulated through tax incentives that: promote and support self-employment and business start-ups, back innovative sectors with a high potential for job creation, improve the job market situation for the most vulnerable groups, such as young people and women, and fight against informal or non-declared employment. It is also important to note, however, that despite the high unemployment rate, there are increasingly more vacancies to be filled due to a lack of personnel with the appropriate skills. This gap needs to be filled by better planning for the needs of the job market and encouraging geographical mobility. In this sense, decisive progress needs to be made towards the creation of a European job market. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, our objective in the area of employment and social issues should continue to be the Europe 2020 strategy. Unfortunately, however, and partly due to the erroneous policies of previous governments, there are some countries, including my own, where there is no longer any room to manoeuvre and the only option left is to apply very rigorous budgetary adjustment programmes to tackle the sovereign debt crisis. Unemployment has reached unacceptable levels and continues to rise in some countries, with young people in a particularly serious situation. Poverty and the risk of social exclusion have increased considerably. There is a greater need than ever to redirect spending towards growth and job creation, and to avoid cutbacks in social policies that would further exacerbate the situation faced by the weakest in society. Fiscal consolidation is a necessary condition, but it is not enough to exit the crisis. Fiscal consolidation, growth and job creation should go hand in hand. The priority elements of national programmes and European Union social policy should be integrated, active inclusion strategies, measures to support sustainable job creation, particularly for the young, and, ultimately, carrying out the necessary reform of our labour markets, as is currently taking place in Spain.

 Madam President, Commissioner, poverty is the cause of the great inequalities on our planet. We cannot accept a system in the 21st century that continues to exacerbate differences between people because of their place of birth, gender, or their country’s development prospects. It is vital to create a new social, employment and economic framework that will ensure the basic needs of our population. Around 80 million people live below the poverty line, of whom more than half are women and 20 million are children. The platform that is the subject of this report could help to achieve greater social justice in Europe. It calls for priority to be placed on education and youth policies as a key element around which to build a fairer and more just society; for an overhaul of the insecure employment contracts that have proliferated in many Member States, undermining protection of the weakest groups in society; for the recognition of the rights of women living in rural areas, whose work is not valued and who are excluded from the basic rights enjoyed by all workers; and for an improvement in national home care programmes for the elderly. The austerity measures that are so badly needed at this time of crisis must not be incompatible with maintaining basic social services. Some 116 million people are threatened by poverty in the European Union, and 42 million live in conditions of severe material deprivation. We must ensure these people’s social protection and create a more prosperous environment that will help to reduce these figures. Lastly, I would like to say how pleased I am with the Council’s decision, following several months of stalled negotiations, to release food aid for the poorest members of society. It is essential to maintain this economic support in the new 2014-2020 funding cycle, with an annual maximum amount of EUR 500 million. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, at a time when Europe is experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis, with unemployment at 9.5%, I think it is very positive to discuss the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs today, and I want to congratulate Ms Bastos on the quality of her report, which forms part of the Europe 2020 strategy and will make a key contribution towards achieving the ambitious target of a 75% employment rate within the European Union. The 23 million unemployed Europeans demand that institutions and governments take the necessary measures and adopt the reforms that guarantee competitiveness in the job market and the creation of jobs. This agenda is on the right track, and we will only achieve this aim by working together within a strengthened single market. I want to make a specific reference to one of the sectors that create most jobs within the Union, and which is suffering the most at present: small and medium-sized enterprises. The importance of SMEs in the European Union is clear if we bear in mind that they generate 84% of jobs. In my country, Spain, that figure is even higher. This means we have to focus our efforts on the flexibility of the job market, the removal of cumbersome processes that slow down company creation, and to provide incentives for the self-employed and SMEs. Job flexibility and security will be key for understanding future legislation, job mobility and the productive collaboration between training institutions and companies. Veronica Lope Fontagné,

Madam President, first of all I would like to draw attention to the significant contribution that cohesion policy has made to economic growth and to the integration of the citizens and territories of the EU. For this reason, it was essential that Parliament should have its say on the policy to be followed from 2013 and it would be unfair to fail to mention the work carried out by Mr Pieper in his extensive report. Within cohesion policy the European Social Fund has been and will be a very important tool to assist Member States to adapt their policies to the Europe 2020 strategy and to combat the financial crisis. The Fund must concentrate its efforts on creating employment, promoting lifelong learning, helping in particular low-skilled workers, those outside the labour market, along with the most vulnerable groups, those who suffer discrimination and, of course, SMEs. It should also aim to achieve social inclusion and reduce poverty. In order to achieve these objectives it is imperative for the Social Fund, as part of the Structural Funds, to count on adequate resources and that administrative and procedural burdens are relaxed as much as possible and reduced to a minimum.

There are various reasons for supporting coal aid: strategic reasons, regional sustainability reasons and social reasons. With regard to the strategic reasons, we need to take into account the fact that the market is changing rapidly. Therefore, abandoning coal without having a viable alternative would not be appropriate. The environmental argument is not relevant either, as imported coal is equally as polluting as indigenous coal. Moreover, we should not forget that, on many occasions, the mines from which we import coal do not comply with social rights. With regard to regional sustainability, in many cases, the mines are in sparsely populated areas that are entirely dependent on the industry to maintain the region, and we risk turning our lands into deserts. The final and most important reason is the more than 180 000 families that could be affected. In Spain, in my region of Aragon, we are pioneers of renewable energy sources, with almost 60% energy independence. The only resource that we can store is coal, and we need more time in order to improve our technologies and apply them to mining, thus transforming our indigenous coal into clean, sustainable coal.

Madam President, Europe needs a strategy that will enable it to emerge stronger from the economic and financial crisis and tackle the long-term challenges that it has to face, such as, for example, the ageing population. In the strategy for the next decade, the Europe 2020 strategy, employment policy has to play a very important role. Its objectives must be sustainable growth, job creation and seeking greater social cohesion, and combating poverty is a new priority for the Union to which my group is committed. The strategy demonstrates the need to undertake structural reforms in order to improve the way that labour markets operate, while also improving competitiveness and productivity. We would not be consistent if we only thought about job creation in the future and allowed existing jobs to be destroyed, as is occurring in some sectors such as the coal sector at the moment, where a large number of jobs could be lost across Europe. Mining needs to be maintained as a strategic reserve and to complement renewable energy sources. If you will allow me, I will talk about my country, Spain, and my region, Aragon. For one of the provinces, Teruel – where the population density is around 12 inhabitants per square metre – the loss of around 5 000 jobs would mean the desertification of a whole area of land. We therefore need to focus, on the one hand, on consolidating and maintaining the jobs that we have at the moment and, on the other, on undertaking the reforms set out in this report.

 Madam President, we believe it to be essential to include the self-employed in this directive, and this view is shared by the representatives of both unions and employers’ associations in my country, who have expressly requested the inclusion of the self-employed in this directive. We believe that there are several reasons for their inclusion. Firstly, because of workers’ safety: self-employed hauliers deserve the same protection as other hauliers, not just when they are driving, but also when they are undertaking other tasks that are directly related to a road transport operation. Secondly, for reasons of fair competition, as bringing back discrimination between self-employed and employed workers will distort both the labour market and the transport market. Finally, it also seems inappropriate to me that each Member State should be able to apply the provisions of the directive to drivers if it so wishes. There needs to be a general rule for the entire EU, since the majority of hauliers work outside their own countries; without it, fair competition would be impeded. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, the future 2020 strategy must enable the European Union to correct the shortcomings detected in the Lisbon Strategy if we really want to create a competitive economic space, and one that is economically, socially and territorially cohesive. In spite of the fact that the postulates of the by now outdated Lisbon Strategy are still valid, I would like to point out that one of the reasons why it lost force was because of its highly complex structure, particularly its lack of clarity in defining the responsibilities and tasks incumbent upon the European Union and other levels of government, particularly those of a regional and local nature. Regions and local authorities must be included in the design and implementation of policies if we want the 2020 strategy to bear any fruit in the medium term. Our regions and cities are key agents in the development and implementation of a great deal of EU public investment related to growth and employment. The allocation of regional policy resources thus becomes a key factor in terms of meeting the European objectives that we are defining. I would like to point out that the resources invested from 2000 to 2006 by way of the European Regional Development Fund have enabled the creation of 1 400 000 jobs in the European Union, as well as the building of over 2 000 km of motorways. I would like to finish by pointing out once more the value of the European regional policy with respect to strategic goals such as growth and employment. Economic, social and territorial cohesion represents a basic objective guaranteed by the treaties. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately we are having to deal with this sad and now customary matter once again. I would like to express my respect and gratitude to all the professionals and volunteers who have contributed to the rescue and reconstruction effort in the affected areas, and I would like to express my particular condolences to the families of the victims. We need to provide help to the victims and pave the way so that the affected areas can recover quickly. We also need to continue working intensively in the area of prevention. Finally, and most importantly, I would call on the Spanish Government to use its current Presidency of the European Union to provide the impetus needed to modify the current European Union Solidarity Fund Regulation – a request already made on a number of occasions by the European Parliament – in order to achieve faster, more flexible and more efficient access to it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wish to express my solidarity with the families of all those affected by the dreadful news of the closure of the Antwerp plant. We are thinking not only of all those who will be directly affected and lose their jobs, but also of all the subcontracting companies that will suffer as a result. We must keep them in mind too. The Figueruelas plant is in my region, Aragón, so this matter affects us directly.

Mr President, I would like to talk about the aid approved under the Temporary Framework aimed at reducing the problems that have arisen as a result of the economic crisis, and specifically about Opel. I would like to ask you whether the Commission is examining whether the aid received by Germany under the Temporary Framework was dependent on a prior agreement regarding the geographical distribution of the restructuring measures, which would not be in line with the purpose of this aid. If this is the case, I would like to know whether you agree with the company having the freedom to revise the distribution and restructuring of Opel according to its own economic and production criteria and maintaining the greatest possible number of jobs.

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, when it was proposed that we have a debate in plenary on the future of Opel Europe, we were not yet aware of the purchase of the company by Magna and its Russian partner, Sberbank, on Thursday. After months of uncertainty, a new phase is beginning for Opel Europe which, for some, is grounds for hope, while for others, grounds for concern. We want the conditions of the final contract, which will be signed in the next few months, to be positive for the future of the company, and I hope that the German Government is right in thinking that this is the most reliable offer for the survival of the company. However, as a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and as someone from Aragon, where the Figueruelas factory, which is currently one of the most productive plants, is located, I must express my concern regarding the fate of the workers. There is talk that in its restructuring plan, Magna is considering making 10 560 workers redundant – currently 1 700 at the Aragon plant – to which many indirect redundancies will have to be added. We are aware that in order to save the company, there needs to be major restructuring, and that this will affect our workers, but we hope that the plan will be made using economic and productivity criteria, seeking to arrive at the best solution for everyone. We trust that, in the coming months, the governments of the affected countries will get involved along with Europe. This will mean that together, using economic criteria, we can support the viability of Opel with the lowest possible cost to the workers at all its European plants. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, in this first plenary sitting of the legislature, we have to deal with this sad and now customary issue: natural disasters and, in particular, fires. Once again we are lamenting the proliferation of fires during the summer of 2009, which have caused human losses. Twenty lives have been lost, all in my country. Therefore, my first thought and my utmost sympathy is for the human suffering caused by these catastrophes. I would like to stress the disastrous impact that this type of disaster has on the lives of the populations that are affected, on their economies, employment, natural and cultural heritage, the environment and tourism. In my region, 22 000 hectares burned this summer, half of which were in areas that are protected due to their environmental importance. We must respond to these problems without hesitation, the people are demanding it. The European institutions cannot be incapable once more of finding an adequate solution for those who are affected. We need to be able to help the victims and to pave the way for restoring the affected areas. We need to continue to work hard on prevention and to proceed further with developing the European civil protection service. I would like to make two calls: firstly, I would like to call on the European Commission to analyse the situation and adopt the appropriate measures to compensate for the social costs inherent in the loss of jobs and sources of income for the inhabitants of the affected regions. Secondly, I would like to call on the Spanish Government, which will hold the Presidency of the Council from January 2010. The Spanish Government must be capable of passing on its feeling and concern to its counterparts. I consider it essential that it makes it a priority in its programme to unblock the reform of the European Solidarity Fund. The Spanish Presidency must also make a clear commitment to developing a common European strategy. It must also review prevention measures and the forestry management models that encourage large fires.Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

Mr President, Commissioner, without ignoring the fact that data protection is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the current Directive was born of the desire to harmonise national provisions on data retention, in order to ensure the availability of those data for the purpose of the investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime, such as terrorism or organised crime.  This harmonisation is necessary because the inefficiency arising from the fragmentation created by national provisions has been demonstrated in studies and through practical experience. We therefore need to ensure the continued retention, at European level, of data that are generated or processed.  A recent example of how these data can be used in a judicial context as a tool to fight crime is the arrest in Spain on 4 October 2012 of a young man planning to imitate the Columbine massacre by planting bombs at universities in the Balearic Islands. Following a police investigation using data obtained from electronic communications, it was ascertained that the young man had bought various explosive substances and items of equipment needed to make homemade bombs. As a result, it was possible to prevent a real tragedy.  Nevertheless, I call on the Commission to present an urgent proposal for the revision of the legal framework for data retention, because the importance and sensitivity of this matter means that we cannot continue with a Directive that has technical shortcomings and intrudes, sometimes disproportionately, on the right to privacy.

 Maintaining international peace and security is one of the EU’s primary objectives. Currently, in our struggle to achieve democratic stability, we should not forget Latin America, which is facing important challenges, as already mentioned: democratic consolidation, regional integration, economic and social stability, poverty and, of course, security in the region. On the other hand, our Latin American neighbours share our values and principles, and they have a number of emerging countries such as Brazil and Mexico, which are key members of international forums such as the G20; finally, the region has great economic potential, with 10% growth forecast for the coming decade. In view of this, I believe that next autumn, the European External Action Service should focus strongly on the multi-party trade agreement between Peru, Colombia and the EU, the association agreement with Central America, and the negotiation of the development cooperation instrument. This is a key region for the EU, and we cannot gradually withdraw right when it is expanding the most. In conclusion, the EU is, and should become, even more aware and involved in conflict prevention and the struggle to maintain security. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the report we are debating today is a big step forward for all victims of crime and barbarity. Its progress lies in its due recognition of victims, and it gives more guarantees to the criminal procedure. Quite simply, victims will now have more legal certainty and society will be more sensitive to their suffering and pain. May I congratulate the two rapporteurs for their excellent work and tenacity, and I would particularly like to mention Ms Jiménez-Becerril, twice a victim of terrorism; through her committed campaigning and the complicity I so admire in Commissioner Reding, they have opened a door through which others will follow, so that judges, leaders and civil society can properly recognise the value, example and trauma of so many victims, providing them with guarantees, justice and respect. Today, Mr President, I would also like to send a message of solidarity to the people of the United States for the terrible tragedy that took place on that 11 September. I send them a testimony of my solidarity in a heartfelt prayer. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 I understand that many issues must be taken into account in the debate on the future of the common agricultural policy (CAP), in the context of the debate on the multiannual financial framework and on the transitory period for 2013, but they should not cause us to forget the urgent need to secure our farmers’ present and future. The economic crisis threatens the sector’s survival, so we need to guarantee the level of aid granted to farms, especially in the countries where we are suffering most from the crisis, such as Spain. The necessary financial discipline should not lead to a drastic adjustment of the CAP or a radical reduction in existing funds. I want to express my doubts regarding a possible single rate, even if it is greater than 50%, as it would mean the most vulnerable regions paying more, while ‘budgetary restrictions’ are being required of the country. This is a complicated debate but, now more than ever, we must increase our efforts to strengthen the CAP as part of the backbone of the EU, not forgetting decisive support for those regions and countries being hit particularly hard by the economic crisis.

 Mr President, this afternoon’s debate is neither new, nor is the issue limited to Romania, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria; it affects all Member States. These are the three affected countries today, but this could happen to any other on other occasions. This House, in fact, in its Declaration of 8 March 2011, has already asked the Commission to establish a new mechanism that will guarantee complete reciprocity for all Member States, ensuring that if a third country fails to reciprocate the visa regime, all Member States would enforce obligatory visa requirements for the citizens of that country. The principles of reciprocity and solidarity should guide the Union’s policy on visas, whilst also respecting, as is the case here, other debates on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the European Union and Canada. Only this way will we achieve a visa policy that is robust, rigorous, credible, supportive and unified. In the same manner, I am also aware of the importance of the Union’s foreign relationships, as well as those of the individual Member States; and for that reason, there is a need to find the balance between respect for the principles of reciprocity and solidarity and European trade relationships. This issue, as you are aware, has been debated for almost a year within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, via a proposal for the modification of Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. This would lead to the establishment of a list of the third countries whose citizens require visas to cross borders and a list of third countries whose citizens are exempt from this requirement. I am the rapporteur for this legislative initiative. The exact objective of this proposal is to provide the Union with an effective and realistic mechanism to resolve conflicts such as those currently being experienced by Romanian, Czech and Bulgarian citizens with Canada. We began the trialogue negotiation stage with the Council a week ago, but I have a strong mandate when it comes to reciprocity. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) is committed and calls for reciprocity. The stances of the three institutions and the Parliament are currently being aligned, but we are all aware of the urgency and the need to reach an agreement that satisfies the interests of all those concerned. Commissioner, I do not believe we can reach this agreement under the Danish Presidency. You are already aware that Parliament only says ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to an international agreement. I will say ‘no’ and will recommend that my political group says ‘no’ if Canada does not absolve the Czechs, Bulgarians and Romanians from the obligation, prior to the vote. Mr President, Mr Enciu makes a very solid and impeccable argument. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the European economic crisis is not strong enough to dissuade illegal immigrants who risk their lives at sea. Why is this? It is because the difficult situation that they find themselves in here does not compare to the conditions there. Besides that, there is the question of asylum, which transcends and has nothing to do with purely economic situations or situations of another nature. Asylum must always be equal to protection. I welcome Mr Iacolino’s initiative as it is very appropriate and I agree that it should be extended and reproduced every year, but in December. The phenomenon of heading out to sea in spring is not a new one – it is predictable – and, although it cannot be avoided, it can be alleviated. The Member States can control neither the Mediterranean nor the Atlantic front on their own. We need a timetable of solidarity, intelligence and diplomacy to do just three things: firstly, to try to stop them leaving at source; secondly, to patrol, save and help those who have managed to get out; and thirdly, to welcome those who have managed to arrive in decent and humanitarian conditions. There needs to be coordinated action between the Commission, the Member States, Frontex and third countries. These are not easy tasks – I am well aware of that – but we must not hold an untimely debate each year that has limited effectiveness. May I remind you that this discussion began in the parliamentary delegation sent to Sicily and Lampedusa almost six months ago. Then there is the question of the immigrant internment centres and the administrative detention centres, which must, without a shadow of a doubt, improve their reception and residence conditions, and the question of a legal, safe return and resettlement subject to scrupulous respect for human rights. As you can see, what I am telling you is not an issue that affects a particular country: it affects the whole of the EU and we must all make a commitment to providing an adequate response to this humanitarian challenge. We are late in saying this, but it is better to say it than not, and it is appropriate to do so on 9 May. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the interinstitutional balance is a reference that is bound by the Treaties and declared a fundamental political issue, both by Parliament and by the Commission and the Council. Mr President, I would like to denounce, as a repeated attitude, the lack of sensitivity on the part of any Commissioner of the European Commission who does not have availability in their schedule to respond to requests for interviews or meetings with MEPs. I will not mention names or specific cases today, but I think that Mr Barroso – who has always set an example of cooperation with Parliament and its MEPs – should send out an unequivocal signal to the College of Commissioners that meetings at the request of MEPs should be a priority and take place frequently. The reasons to protect cooperation and the much talked-about interinstitutional balance are unquestionable, not to mention the due respect that this House deserves.

Madam President, here is my opinion on the matter. As a response to the threats that the EU and the US must face, the Passenger Name Records (PNR) Agreement must be interpreted within the framework of the fight against transnational crime in all its dimensions. The strategy on the external dimension of Justice and Home Affairs, the EU strategy against terrorism and the Stockholm Programme all refer to the need to establish close cooperation with third countries through exchange of information. The data that are gathered under the PNR Agreement are used for purposes of preventing, detecting, suppressing and pursuing and for those purposes only. This new agreement provides great improvements by comparison with the 2007 agreement. The PUSH method is recognised as the mode of transfer, there is greater protection for data gathered, the number of supervisory authorities is increased and there are advances in data evaluation, not to mention the right of citizens to request correction or deletion of their PNR data, with the possibility of administrative or judicial redress. Moreover, the agreement respects the right to privacy in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Limitations may only be introduced where they are necessary and where they genuinely meet the general interest objectives recognised by the EU or protect the rights and freedoms of others. In these circumstances, we have two options: vote in favour of the agreement, and benefit from the improvements that have been introduced, or vote against. In the latter case, we would create great legal uncertainty that could lead to the signing of bilateral agreements, and to penalties and obligations being placed on airlines. We must commit and ensure a high level of effective protection of personal data, which means that any transfer of PNR data to the US must be done in a secure manner and in accordance with EU law and that passengers can exercise their rights in relation to the use of their data. In light of this situation then, Madam President, I am in favour of this agreement to combat terrorism and transnational crime.

Madam President, actually, I was referring to EU security strategy and the Stockholm Programme. You must not have been listening properly. The fact is, you use the language of Goethe and I use the language of Cervantes, and we have interpreters but, in spite of this, we cannot communicate with one another. Why? We cannot communicate because you speak of impressions and I speak of experiences. Based on my experiences, therefore, I am firmly in favour of the Passenger Name Records (PNR) in matters of security. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Coelho, thank you. We must highlight the advances represented by the use of biometric passports but we cannot deny the problems that exist in terms of implementation, especially the weaknesses detected in the passport-issuance chain. It would serve no purpose to equip border controls with great technical instruments if the system has a significant weakness in terms of procedures. In this context, if we take it into account, the balance between combating crime in the EU, respecting individual rights and guaranteeing free movement in the Schengen area takes on even greater importance. The forging of documents, organised crime and terrorism constitute direct attacks on our citizens but also on their personal rights and so we must reinforce the whole process of gathering and handling information of a personal nature. We must afford greater security to the travel document, establishing a reliable link between the passport and its holder. Accordingly, repeated fraudulent practice provides ample justification for the evaluation reports. Commissioner Malmström, we await the intermediate report scheduled for June, and the report scheduled for mid-2013, with great interest. We continue to back training for those responsible for managing the system, along with improvements to and interoperability of equipment and documents issued at each of the stages, without compromising, of course, either the information or the rights of the holder of the passport. Commissioner, being in a position to determine the scope of the issue of fingerprinting children, which, as has already been stated, is currently under study, is very important. Therefore, I place great value on the Portuguese Government’s decision to give reliability to the procedure. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, I echo the need to reach an overall agreement for the future that ensures the survival of the most deprived persons in the Union. We are talking about vulnerable, excluded, and poor people. The figures state that 13 million people in 19 Member States are experiencing poverty, 30 million people are undernourished, and 43 million people are at risk of experiencing food poverty, which shows the need to work together in order to ensure the programme continues after 2013. We must make use of the debate on the multiannual financial framework, as well as the debate on CAP reform, in order to ensure food aid and to overcome the legal obstacles. The Member States are going through a difficult period, but that is exactly why we now have to make greater efforts to protect those who are suffering the most due to the crisis: children, the sick, the unemployed, the elderly, and those 80 million people who are currently living below the poverty line in general. The Commission’s right to initiative is vital and essential. There are no disagreements in that respect in this Parliament, Mr President. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, I was and I am a supporter of Kosovo. During the Milosevic era I was in the refugee camps in Kukes, Elbasan, Stankovic, and so on. I welcomed many members of the Kosovo Liberation Army to my own city and offered them my solidarity. However, Mr President, Kosovo today has problems of corruption, control of the media, organised crime, and of government with room for improvement. In my opinion, Mr President, Kosovo does not today meet any of the necessary conditions either for being in the European Union or for being an independent country.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to heartily congratulate Mr Rui Tavares. This debate is a step towards the Union undertaking more humanitarian work, and providing greater international protection for refugees. We commend the improvement in reception conditions, the use of asylum procedures and the promotion of good and effective practices to ensure that people’s rights are protected in the international domain. Taking into account the fact that there were 301 000 asylum applications last year, of which 59 465 were accepted, we must streamline resettlement measures in the interest of maximising the efficiency of the services supplied. Five thousand resettlements in Europe is still very small in solidarity terms. I also went to Shusha. Far more Member States are going to have to involve themselves in resettlement, and therefore, we support the provision of additional financial support for those making the effort for the first time. There is also the need to provide additional financial support for the resettlement of people from specific geographical regions and nationalities once this has been decided as the most appropriate way of responding to their specific needs. The urgency and priority of Member State support should not be forgotten when it comes to children and women from specific risk groups, the victims of psychological, physical and sexual violence, as well as the victims of exploitation. One in every five asylum seekers is under the age of thirteen. Congratulations, Mr President, for this interinstitutional agreement. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Mr President, I understand that regulation when it comes to data protection can be based on internal security strategies. We cannot forget, however, that its extra-territorial impact could infringe on the rights of European citizens. What has arisen in connection with the Medicare Act, FISA, the Patriot Act and FATCA cases is more than mere concern. It appears that many of these measures stipulate that European financial entities, in the widest sense of the term, are obliged to provide all types of information, whether it concerns the title holder, their account types or the withholding of payments, among others. There is no prior agreement to justify obtaining this data, nor do the users know what the data will be used for or the amount of time for which it will be stored. It is therefore necessary to adopt measures and design a body of regulations and legislation to avoid infringement of the principle of territoriality. We should be able to maintain our relationships outside the Union, as well as our territory’s security, whilst totally respecting the rights of European citizens. The European Commission should show much more commitment and interest in this task. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I reiterate: the food programme must be extended indefinitely. Our credibility is linked to the solidarity we show, and more so in a crisis period. Nobody can reasonably deny this, nor will they be able to. We know the disappointing and bitter figures. What poor person cares about the legal basis, or the ruling, or the common agricultural policy or the social dimension? Are we going to explain it to them? I do not want to and I cannot. We do not provide any justification for not giving, ladies and gentlemen, but we want to justify the fact that now we are taking away what we once gave them, and this is truly inexplicable. I ask for justice and I ask for compassion. We cannot reduce the EUR 500 million, because it is needed. For poor people, the situation is not a crisis. It is critical, and it affects the most vulnerable of them: old people, children, the sick, the homeless, those without power, without medicines and without food. React, ladies and gentlemen of the Council, react. I do not see any poor person sitting in the Council, Mr President. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, let me say it again: the food programme must be extended until 2020. The programme provides food aid to 13 million poor people in 19 Member States. Thirty million people in the Union suffer from malnutrition, 43 million are at risk of suffering from food poverty and 80 million live below the poverty threshold. What we are asking for – what I am asking for – is not charity. It is compassion and it is justice. We must maintain the level of financing at EUR 500 million. The poor are those who are suffering most from the crisis and much more so in winter: without a roof over their heads, in extreme cold, without power and without food. This affects the most vulnerable: children, old people and the sick. Solidarity within the Union cannot now be a dialectical resource, because that would make it a contemptible resource.

 Mr President, our energy dependence is a well-known fact. We import 60% of our gas and 83% of our oil. As for coal, our dependence amounts to 41%. Coal is the Union’s principal electricity-producing fuel, on a par with nuclear energy and gas. If we limit our mining capacity, we will simply have to import it from countries that do not have our social or environmental standards. In its energy strategy for 2050, the Commission should review the current framework of aid provision to coal mining. There is scope for improvement of the new legislation as regards the time limit for mine closure or the requirement to return the aid received in order to continue in operation. Our energy dependency is one more of our external weaknesses and, in the current crisis, we will pay the price for it sooner rather than later. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, it is regrettable that the European Union should abandon thousands of refugees to their fate on account of a mere institutional disagreement, and I am pointing my finger at the Council. The debate on the legislative procedure to choose priority regions has gone to absurd extremes, breaking the principle of solidarity which inspires the Union and the European Refugee Fund. The issue is not whether we should use a procedure based partially on codecision, as proposed by the Council, or the ordinary legislative procedure proposed by this House. The really important matter is to help those who most need it and to ensure the priority regions are chosen promptly so that the ultimate aim of helping persecuted and deprived people can be achieved. If this choice is considered a delegated act, then let us accept the comitology procedure; if not, let us agree once and for all on the mechanism through which the choice is to be made. I have visited many refugee camps, the last one of them in July …  (The President cut off the speaker) Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Madam President, I fully support the proposal for a directive; it is a real breakthrough. Furthermore, Ms Angelilli’s commitment to the cause of child protection is one of the most noble objectives that a parliamentarian can undertake. Children are weak and vulnerable and therefore deserve the highest level of protection. Sexual abuse of children must be prevented with new legislative measures and punished harshly under criminal law. So-called sex tourism and child pornography are forms of exploitation which should be a matter of priority for law enforcement, including international agreements on the matter. In my opinion, all agreements with third countries on free trade and development aid must include a child protection clause. We must also focus our serious concerns on the child indoctrination that occurs in some countries suffering structural poverty, where they hand over many children, the offspring of polygamous unions, to apparently religious schools to avoid lack of food and hunger. Child assassins, child soldiers and child drug runners are among the most heinous forms of exploitation, a widespread phenomenon on two continents which has irreversible social repercussions. Programmes to rescue child victims of forced prostitution must be a political and social priority of the European Union. Line 11600 must have the commitment and unwavering support of all Member States. Madam President, I appreciate and applaud the effort and commitment of the Council, but I particularly applaud the commitment of Ms Malmström and Ms Angelilli.

 Mr President, I congratulate Ms Lambert and the shadow rapporteurs on the impetus given to this report, without which there would have been no agreement with the Council. How to go about deciding who qualifies as a family member was a key factor for my group. This needs to be defined properly to prevent abuse of the Community system for international protection. The distinction between beneficiaries of asylum and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection is essential when agreeing on who has what rights. Subsidiary protection is more limited in time than asylum, the former status providing entitlement to a shorter residence permit (one year) and the latter to a longer residence permit (three years), although both cases can be reviewed if the threat to the beneficiaries remains. The plan to remove the distinction between the two forms of protection was originally rejected by my group and by the Council, which is why we must now congratulate ourselves on the agreement reached with the rapporteur. The need to recognise the rights that legitimately belong to those that are persecuted is consistent with measures to prevent fraudulent use of the European system for international protection. We must also welcome the fact that the report sets out the need for Member States and their authorities to safeguard the best interests of minors and to extend protection to unaccompanied minors, paying particular attention to their safety, well-being and development, as well as the principle of family unity. Lastly, Mr President, the inclusion of references to persecution by customs or traditions, resulting in genital mutilation, forced abortion or forced sterilisation is a remarkable and outstanding achievement.

Mr President, this is a debate that has already taken place, but I shall make some comments with reference to new scenarios. Following the failed attack on a plane on 25 December 2009, more effective protection and detection technology had to be sought. Scanners at airports increase levels of security but they present problems, especially in relation to the protection of human rights. The Council and the Commission accepted Mr de Grandes Pascual’s proposal that security scanners should not use technology based on ionising radiation. Now it must be decided whether the exploration mechanism will use real passenger images or stick images, which are the most appropriate option in order to protect the intimacy, privacy, health and dignity of passengers. However, stick figures present a problem in terms of free competition since today, only one company has that technology. Although other companies in the sector have announced that they can introduce the algorithms needed in order to adapt the scanners, the machine configuration time could work against them. Therefore, the Commission should examine the timeframe for implementing the rules relating to body scanners, avoiding a possible monopoly situation and supporting decisively Parliament’s report and the report of Mr de Grandes Pascual, which are one and the same thing. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, Ms Meissner, thank you very much for your interesting question. Strictly speaking, in order to avoid what you are unhappy about and what I, too, am unhappy about, I would say and repeat that what the Commission should do is examine the timeframe for the implementation of rules relating to body scanners very carefully. That way, everyone will be able to compete on equal terms but in line with what has been said by Parliament and in Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, let us indeed talk about solidarity and the poor. In the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting, a blocking minority opposed the amendment to the regulation governing food aid to the most disadvantaged. Mr Sawicki has already explained their reasons. However, the Council should be reminded that 60% of the funds is needed to feed the 79 million people in Europe who live below the poverty line. Those funds are provided by national, regional and local governments, and by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Up until last April, the European Union contributed 40%. The position taken by the blocking minority would lead to a drastic reduction in aid for next year, and a complete abolition by 2013. We condemn this. I would like to thank the Polish Presidency and the Commission for their determination to continue the programme, and I emphatically condemn the position of those Member States that formed a blocking minority. I ask those Member States: where is your compassion? Have you even heard of compassion? I urge Mr Cioloş and Mr Sawicki not to give up, because no court can go against the law of God, or against compassion. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Madam President, Commissioner, on my initiative, between 13 July 2011 and 16 July 2011 a delegation from the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs went to Tunisia, specifically to the refugee camps on its border with Libya and the camp at Sousse. There are 4 500 people from Darfur, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire, Palestine and Iraq living in inhumane conditions and suffering an extreme temperature of 50 degrees centigrade. There is sickness and violence; the camp has burned down three times; and there is a lack of hygiene and drinking water. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Médecins Sans Frontières
 and other organisations are doing a tremendous job. Tunisia has shown solidarity with displaced persons and refugees from Libya. Tunisians have welcomed 90 000 Libyans into their own homes. However, beyond this emergency nobody is taking care of those in Sousse. There is a major difference between the Europe that donates and the Europe that does not receive. Our solidarity extends to other countries, but we do not show solidarity within our borders. We now need to make an impassioned plea for resettlement, so that the 4 000 refugees can be received on European soil. This is neither complicated nor expensive. There has been a show of commitment, as the Commissioner said, but there needs to be something more than good will and statements of intent. We urgently need to resettle those groups who are suffering so much hardship in Sousse and who, in Europe, could find hope for their shattered lives. Many times and in desperate voices they asked Europe not to abandon them. Others told us their child had lost 10 kilos and was malnourished and in need of medical attention, but they had nowhere to go. Resettlement offers have so far totalled – or would total, if they were carried out – 718, but that still leaves 3 707 people. Madam President, I strongly call on the Council and the Commission to show commitment in order to end this serious humanitarian crisis as soon as possible. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, the European Union is Taiwan’s fifth largest trading partner, whereas for the Union, this Asian island ranks fourteenth among its trading partners. Trade between the two parties has increased by 800% in the last decades, with the annual trade volume currently standing at EUR 27.5 billion. Last year alone, trade between the Union and Taiwan grew by 39%. This growth has been boosted by measures such as visa exemption, introduced via the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. In spite of this and the fact that the Europe 2020 strategy stresses that the Union needs to step up its trade links with growing and emerging markets, our relations with Taiwan have not reached their full development as far as trade is concerned. It is therefore necessary to bring in new measures to remove the obstacles – including tariffs, trade prohibitions, taxes and duties on luxury products – which currently prevent us from unlocking the full potential of trade with Taiwan. This would be a decisive step towards a dynamic, ambitious free trade agreement, which I support. A free trade agreement is necessary and it will benefit the parties involved. Good trade dialogue is not enough, Commissioner. We need to go much further. Furthermore, no one has the right to veto our relations. The ties between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China are getting stronger every day, and we, the European Union, have sovereignty to decide, without anyone’s interference, who we negotiate our free trade agreements with.

 Madam President, on 29 June 2011 a group of Taliban terrorists murdered Antonio Planas in Kabul, a Spanish national like myself, aged 49, married and the father of a young girl. Until a few days ago, certain Spanish nationals who were victims of terrorist attacks outside of the European Union territory could not have access to protection and compensation mechanisms. On 23 June 2011, however, the legislation was amended to benefit terrorist victims and their relatives, irrespective of the country where the attack took place. The threat is not limited to a given territory and it must be prevented at national, EU and international level, strengthening cooperation with third countries. The defence of terrorist victims and their rights should be a priority policy in the Union, and the institutions should encourage their public recognition. Thus, we welcome the actions proposed by the Commission, although more concrete instruments to help the victims of terror are still needed. The family of Antonio Planas needs our help, and we urge the institutions concerned to provide it. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, corruption costs the European Union the same amount as its annual budget. Four out of every five citizens consider corruption to be one of the biggest problems for Member States. On 6 June 2011, the Commission published the package of measures aimed at fighting corruption. That is commendable. These measures include the introduction of updated EU rules on public procurement, rules on auditing and regulatory monitoring of EU companies, development of a biannual report that identifies corruption trends, measures relating to the confiscation of criminal assets, a strategy to improve research on financial crime, and the action plan for improving statistics on corruption offences. These proposals are warmly welcomed. Nevertheless, we need to show caution with regard to Member States’ individual compliance with implementation, especially when we consider the data provided by the report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to which 12 out of the 27 EU Member States have no anti-corruption rules or have minimal, insufficient standards. That is why we have doubts about the Commission’s real capacity – despite its best intentions – to implement the measures it has proposed; it therefore needs to go further, guaranteeing that all the Member States make a real commitment to combating corruption, for this is of great necessity, above and beyond expert groups, political will or generalities. We call for specific, legally-binding actions. That is what we are asking for. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Madam President, I offer my sincere congratulations to Mr Busuttil, to the Commission and to the Council. The creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is one of the Union’s greatest achievements, enabling almost 500 million people to move freely within its territory. The removal of internal borders meant that the peripheral countries were obliged to strengthen their border controls, a function which, as you will recall, falls within the exclusive competence of the countries concerned. The land-locked countries benefit from the free area, but occasionally they forget that this situation is largely due to the effort made by Member States with external boundaries, an effort which is bound to increase in situations where there is a migration crisis. To an ever-increasing extent, these situations require the intervention of Frontex. However, the agency’s ability to react is limited as it lacks the necessary resources. This lack of resources is due in large part to the lack of real commitment on the part of certain Member States. Thus, it was necessary and appropriate to strengthen the Frontex Regulation, clearly defining the agency’s role and providing the legal instruments enabling it to be equipped with the necessary means and resources needed to carry out its goals in full accordance with fundamental rights. The provision of economic, material and human resources cannot depend on the good will of only some Member States, since solidarity should be binding and general. Frontex should also coordinate its activities with Europol and Eurojust to fight organised crime. Cooperation with the European Asylum Support Office is an essential element in ensuring access to international protection. The creation of a system of border guards is an interesting proposal which may be brought about if it is implemented through the compulsory solidarity clause. In short, approval of the proposed regulation will make it possible to manage migratory flows better, fight the mafias more effectively and improve the common asylum system.

 Mr President, I reject this report as inappropriate, mistaken, misinformed, untimely and subjective. The fight against terrorism is very necessary and it must be efficient, act as a deterrent and have a preventative effect too. Although it must be valued, its costs should never be evaluated in economic terms. How many euros does a life cost? How many euros do three thousand lives cost? I support democratic judges and police officers and I trust in them and I believe in our democratic vitality to correct the abuses of power that could occur. I would also cite psalm 46 in solidarity: ‘Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea’. I share the reflected absence too; it is present in my heart and in my speeches as are all the victims: those of Madrid, London, Marrakech, Casablanca and Bali, all of them. No, Mr President, this own-initiative report is a bad initiative. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Madam President, the reality: 30 million people are malnourished and 79 million people live in poverty; the tragedy: a court decision; the shame: that we allow this. The European Parliament must make its unanimous and powerful voice heard. This is an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to the weakest people. We must make a distinction between selfish rhetoric and real solidarity. We, Madam President, must create the momentum so that the Council allows us to do away with the blocking minority. We are wholeheartedly calling for the solidarity – agreed to yesterday in this House – of the President-in-Office of the Council, of the Polish Presidency. Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament cannot forsake millions of people, the poorest of the poor, who suffer the most acute effects of the crisis. We are talking about a budget going from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million, which is a decrease of 63%. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, within an hour, Parliament must clearly declare that, regardless of the outcome of the court decision, the essence of the EU, which is solidarity, is present here, in this House, the house of the people and of the European peoples.

Mr President, Schengen is a milestone in the construction of the area of liberty, security and justice. Freedom of movement is, moreover, a fundamental pillar of the EU, enshrined in Article 45 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights and it must be preserved and protected. We need more Europe, not less Europe. Limiting the Schengen agreement is not the solution. What we must do is overcome, once and for all, the reluctance of some Member States to make advances in the sphere of immigration. The EU has the means to do it but the political will is lacking. We can and must reinforce external border control mechanisms, improve and equip the capabilities and means of Frontex, promote the creation and implementation of Eurosur, drive the implementation of the second generation Schengen Information System and the Visa Information System, foster cooperation and the exchange of information between border, police, judicial and customs services, and advance determinedly towards the construction of a common policy on matters of immigration, asylum and visas that gives special consideration to cooperation agreements with third countries. The performance of the Member States in the sphere of immigration should be inspired by Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, helping in solidarity those who, by virtue of their geographic position, are obliged to deal with extraordinary flows of irregular immigrants or those seeking international protection. The responsibility must be shared in this regard, Mr President. I am bound to note that the reintroduction of border controls and internal controls for circumstances not provided for in Articles 23, 24 and 25 of the Schengen Borders Code is illegal and seriously violates the provisions of Article 77 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The mechanism for evaluation by a Community court, proposed by the Commission, should be the only instrument and should be extraordinary and temporary. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very rigorous work. The objective of this report is to maintain a high level of security in airports while safeguarding citizens’ fundamental rights. Air transport is a target for terrorist attacks, and it is therefore necessary to strengthen security in order to protect people, infrastructure, cargo and mail. In that respect, security scanners in airports are a useful tool. Their inclusion among screening methods used to detect banned or dangerous items is therefore necessary. However, it is vital for a thorough evaluation to be carried out in advance, in order to determine the least harmful technology and the level of non-cumulative emissions that is acceptable for public health. It is also important that, with this technology, the protection of personal data is guaranteed and the dignity of the individual being screened is preserved. I would like to point out that Member States can implement stricter security measures than those required by European legislation, thus having the capacity to introduce scanners in airports under their jurisdiction. The EU institutions therefore need to lay down common rules of procedure with regard to detection performance criteria and tools. Information relating to the screening procedure is a vital element of this tool. Airport personnel must receive proper training in order to provide passengers with adequate information on screening safety, voluntary participation, alternatives and the deletion of images. To conclude, I would like to emphasise that any passenger’s decision to refuse screening does not make them a suspect, and that the selection criteria for being scanned will be based exclusively on security reasons and not on any other grounds, such as race or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religion, and so on. Having nothing further to add, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Madam President, I support Mr Coelho’s thorough work and I congratulate him on his negotiating capacity, in Parliament and at first reading. In terms of the need to create a new agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems, we should remember that the Commission itself has declared that it cannot assume the responsibility for managing large databases, and that creating a merely executive agency would not in any case give Parliament control, because it would still be embedded in the structure of the European Commission. Considering the important work being entrusted to the new agency and the need for this work to be scrutinised by Parliament, however, the new body should take the form of a European agency with its own legal status. Its objectives should be clearly defined, these being operational management of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS) and Eurodac. It could also take responsibility for the preparation, development and operational management of other large-scale information systems. However, it should be noted that this must in all cases be done with the right legal instruments. The agency will not under any circumstances be able to take political decisions, such as creating new information systems or decisions on interoperability with different systems. The important role that the agency is to play means it must have a reinforced administrative structure that will ensure data integrity and protection, and for this reason it is essential that it incorporate a post of data security manager and an independent data protection body, thereby complying with the legal provisions contained in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In conclusion, Mr Coelho, I am very much in agreement with your three initial points, and with the seven points made by Parliament on making a strong commitment to reaching an EU solution and taking a firm stand against any limitation of the Schengen Area.

 Mr President, 30 million people in the European Union suffer from malnutrition and a further 79 million live below the poverty threshold. Most of them depend on food aid provided primarily by food banks. Some 40% of the funds needed to provide this food come from contributions made by the Union, through the European Scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union. This scheme has been implemented to date in accordance with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 983/2008 establishing aid for the purchase of cereals, skimmed milk powder and rice. The Regulation was partially revoked in April by the General Court of the European Union, with the budget for food aid being reduced from EUR 500 million to EUR 133 million. The integration of the European Union has historically been based on the principle of solidarity. This is why, Mr President, we urge the new Polish Presidency and the European Parliament, now more than ever, to show their commitment to helping the most deprived, and to re-establishing the budget appropriation that is currently so limited. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

Mr President, in my view, the arrest warrant is a fundamental tool in the fight against organised crime, terrorism and other forms of crime. It is a proven tool and, according to the Decision, the cornerstone of cooperation and the first concrete example of the principal of mutual recognition in the sphere of criminal law. Of course it is a very useful tool but we must not fail to mention that it also has weaknesses. The weaknesses are perfectly identified, as Commissioner Reding has also said, not only in the Commission’s report of April 2011, but also in its reports of 2005 and 2006. Those weaknesses, which stem fundamentally from two basic and essential premises, can and, naturally, must be corrected. The arrest warrant has two components: issue and refusal or surrender, as appropriate. The figures show that it is a useful tool, with 54 000 arrest warrants having been issued and 12 000 executed. Turning to the question of what corrections need to be made, what we need are greater and better procedural guarantees around issue, refusal and surrender. The issue of proportionality or the lack thereof in the use of the arrest warrant is critical, a key issue. For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to hear Commissioner Reding say that Member States will be required to exercise a proportionality test and to take care not to issue arrest warrants for minor offences. Incidentally, Mr President, during the course of these questions, one particular item has slipped in, namely, that every arrest warrant costs the Public Treasury EUR 25 000. This is something that was said by an Irish judge. I say to that judge that I do not believe it and that he should demonstrate on what basis such a calculation was made. Consequently, I believe that the arrest warrant should continue in force in revitalised form, with better procedural guarantees. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

No, Mr Dartmouth. I believe that the European Arrest Warrant is a more useful and more versatile tool for combating all the forms of crime to which we have referred. Commissioner Reding has already told you, and I emphasise the fact, that an extradition order can take up to a year whereas a European Arrest Warrant, on the other hand, must be substantiated within 40 days. That is why I believe that the latter is a much more versatile and much more useful procedure for fighting crime, wrongdoing and terrorism. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

 Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Coelho, and I do this because his work is consistently rigorous. I now add that we must help Bulgaria and Romania. I trust Bulgaria and Romania. They have worked well and hard and they should receive what is theirs by right – this is no gift. The Presidency-in-office of the Council and the Commissioner, Mrs Malmström, have both stated that these two countries comply with the technical and legal requirements, and I add my voice to theirs. I believe we should not consider any criteria other than the strictly technical and legal. These criteria essentially number five. They comply with the following: they comply with the data protection requirements, they comply with the Schengen Information System (SIS), they comply with police cooperation, they comply with the issue of visas and they comply with the control of external borders by air, sea and land. Strictly speaking, they also comply with the SIS and with the Supplementary Information Request at the National Entry (SIRENE). In view of all this, this House should send an unequivocally strong message to the Council and, notably, to the permanent representations of five countries that I shall refrain from mentioning but which are in the minds of all of us here today. I do believe, ladies and gentlemen, that in including Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area, which comprises more than four hundred million human beings, we are adding, not subtracting; we are building a stronger Europe. Furthermore, we should avoid double standards. Nor should we set conditions for Romania and Bulgaria that we do not ask of the other Member States in order to form part of this area of freedom. Thus, to end my speech, I fervently express my wish for a strong, majority-endorsed message to be sent from this House to the Council. Congratulations once again, Mr Coelho, and congratulations to Romania and Bulgaria. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to speak and to use this debate to talk about a fundamental issue: the emergency. They cannot cope alone. The root of this problem is, as everybody knows, in the unstable situations in Tunisia and Egypt, and the war in Libya. However, there is no limit to how long it will last: unfortunately, it will last a worrying length of time. We therefore need to decide how we can use our common policies to manage the emergency, because they cannot cope alone. In my opinion, Madam President, Commissioner, solidarity with the victims and solidarity with the host states and regions must be our priority. We have instruments that we are not using properly. We have four funds. Mrs Malmström told us clearly and briskly about sums that strike me as ridiculous. She spoke of EUR 30 million, EUR 25 million on request, etc. However, our four funds, the Refugee Fund, the Return Fund, the External Borders Fund and the Integration Fund, total almost EUR 3 billion within the scope of the financial perspectives. Mrs Malmström, it seems to me that these funds should be used for emergency situations, because we need to have the ability to use them and modify them. Our limitations in terms of collaboration and solidarity are symbolised by the fragility that the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union has demonstrated with the Hermes Operation. The arrival of increasing numbers of people fleeing the war and fleeing from desperation highlight how limited this capacity is. They cannot cope alone. Who can cope? The European Union has the necessary solidarity to meet the requirements of this emergency in real time. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I think nobody will be surprised to hear me say again that solidarity with refugees and displaced persons should constitute a fundamental element of EU policy in the areas of asylum and immigration. However, it is not just a question of having solidarity with those coming from weak and disadvantaged societies, but also with the Member States that, because of their geographic location, their culture or their language, suffer greater pressure in this regard. While numbers of applications for protection and of immigrants arriving are low in some countries, there are many other  countries that are unable to tackle on their own the pressure their borders are subjected to on a daily basis. Following Parliament’s adoption of the reports relating to the Commission communication on the Union resettlement programme and the modification of the European Refugee Fund in May 2010, we are still waiting for the Council to complete the codecision procedure. The pilot projects currently being undertaken in 10 Member States are a drop in an ocean, which we still have to cross. The southern Member States are subjected to great pressure, particularly since the popular movements in Egypt and Tunisia, and the war in Libya, began. Lampedusa, with a population of 5 000, has received almost 6 000 immigrants since the conflicts started. The aforementioned pilot projects are completely insufficient and will hardly do anything to relieve the pressure that is already affecting Italy and Malta, but will affect other Mediterranean countries in the near future. The Union as a whole must help these countries. It is imperative that the Council overcome the obstacles currently preventing the full implementation of a European resettlement programme and defeat the minorities blocking it. Massive population displacements and migrations affect the Union as a whole and not just a part of it. I am finishing, Mr President. Last week I called for a European Parliament presence on Libya’s borders and I repeat that call now. It is not enough for 10 fellow Members to have spent last week in Egypt: we must have the capacity to evaluate the humanitarian situation ourselves. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE
).

 Mr President, there are thousands of refugees and thousands of displaced people. The solution to this emergency is evacuation. What is needed is transport. As Mr Guterres said, these people do not want to come to the European Union; they want to go back home. There are 2 million immigrants, 1 million Egyptians and 80 000 Bangladeshis. We must focus on the weakest of the weak: Eritreans, Somalis, the sub-Saharan Africans mistaken for mercenaries and Palestinians. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) says it needs USD 160 million over three months for water, medicines, food and transport. We expect a resounding response from the Union on Friday. Gaddafi cannot escape international criminal justice: mass attacks on his people constitute crimes against humanity. Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is already taking action. Mr President, the European Parliament must be involved. We are also a democratic instrument for applying pressure and informing the free world. We need a mandate from this Chamber for a delegation of Parliament in the UNHCR, Red Cross and Red Crescent refugee camps. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

 Mr President, in 2012, we urgently need a common asylum policy. The report presented by the Commission on 8 September highlights the numerous obstacles that the Member States encounter when seeking to achieve the objectives of Directive 2005/85/EC. Asylum seekers’ right to legal aid applies at different levels. Many Member States invoke the directive in providing legal assistance at the appeal stage, while others grant that right during both the application process and at second instance. Some Member States require proof of merit in order to decide whether or not free legal assistance is granted at the appeal stage. In the majority of cases, there are major differences regarding the deadlines for appealing, while the applicability of the automatic suspension of the effects of refusals also presents difficulties, as it only applies in six Member States. These differences demonstrate that the directive must be reviewed. In reviewing it, the Commission stresses the need to focus efforts on the initial phase of the procedure, in order to be more effective in differentiating which people have a right to protection. According to the Commission, this measure will help to save significant interpreting and legal assistance costs at second instance. However, the proposal is not accompanied by a detailed study of what the interpreting and legal assistance costs would be at first instance, nor of the costs that the Member States actually incur currently when applying the European legislation. For that reason, the Commission needs to provide information as to the actual costs relating to its proposal to focus efforts, and I do not think that the refusal that I have just heard from the Commission is acceptable. I sincerely believe that this is unacceptable and that it needs to be reconsidered or qualified. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, international adoption that is inspired by the principles of prevalence of the interests of the child and respect for his fundamental rights is an appropriate means of finding a family for children for whom a family cannot be found in their country of origin. People trafficking, sexual exploitation and work slavery are a terrible reality affecting hundreds of millions of minors. Let us look at some of the statistics: there are more than 145 million abandoned children in the world; in Russia alone, more than 600 000 live on the streets; since 1980, more than 2 million children have died in armed conflicts; more than 600 million children live in extreme poverty; more than 5 million die every year; more than 130 million children in developed countries grow up without access to a basic education due to their poverty, and 60% of them are girls; 7 million children worldwide are subject to sexual slavery. For all these reasons, we must foster mechanisms to promote an international adoption instrument inspired by protecting children, harmonising the different requirements and procedures laid down in the legislation of the Member States, in particular, applying Article 21 of the European Charter of Children’s Rights and taking into consideration Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,

Madam President, Commissioner, trafficking in human beings is a harsh reality in the EU. Sexual exploitation is the main objective of the mafias that traffic human beings, followed by forced labour, domestic service, forced marriages, exploitation of children for begging, illegal adoption and the removal of organs, which are other scourges and aspects of the problem. The new powers that Article 63 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives Parliament must be used in order to strengthen EU legislation in this field. This includes, among many other issues, calling for the classification of crimes that are still not covered by some European criminal legislation. We need to strengthen our legislation to protect victims of trafficking from two perspectives: prevention and protection, and integration into society and the labour market. We need to establish specific measures to protect minors; to criminalise traffickers and middlemen; to establish measures to discourage demand and confiscate the proceeds of the crime; to establish the criminal responsibility of any legal persons that take part in any phase of trafficking; to step up employment inspection and penalties for the exploitation of employees and illegal hiring of irregular immigrants; to strengthen the role of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders and of the immigration liaison officers in detecting the channels used by traffickers and their modus operandi
; and finally, strengthening the role of the joint investigation teams of the European Police Office (Europol) in combating the mafias. I would like to conclude by adding that the figure of the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator could make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives that I have mentioned, although his powers and capacities must be clearly defined in order to prevent actions from being duplicated or interference with the functions entrusted to Europol. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Mr President, the increase in asylum applications on behalf of citizens of Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia requires measures protecting the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. Visas are an instrument included in the framework of immigration policies; their purpose is to legalise the entry and temporary stay in a country where the applicant is neither a non-national nor a resident. Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 provides for an evaluation mechanism for visa extension, in which certain requirements in relation to illegal immigration, public order and security, the Union’s external relations, territorial cohesion and the principle of reciprocity must be fulfilled. This mechanism could also function in the opposite direction. Asylum, on the other hand, is an instrument of protection that cannot be used incorrectly. It should be pointed out that the purpose of the European Union’s common policy in this area is to preserve the integrity of asylum as an instrument of protection for the persecuted, prioritising the principles of the Geneva Convention and the New York Protocol, applying common criteria for the identification of people who genuinely require international protection and a guaranteed common minimum level of benefits in all Member States for the welfare of those people. Asylum is therefore an instrument of humanitarianism and solidarity and, hence, exclusive in its purpose and nature. This is why it is important that the European Union reacts and helps the Serbian and Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonian authorities to adopt sufficient measures regarding the requirements that must be fulfilled to benefit from refugee status or subsidiary protection status, thereby avoiding improper or fraudulent use of them.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members, Mrs Guillaume, Mr Ilchev, Mrs Keller, Mrs Wikström and Mr Tavares. The support they have given me has improved this report. I would specifically like to draw the Council’s and the Commission’s attention to the terminology. From my point of view, it would be more appropriate if we used the term ‘irregular immigration’. Up to now, clandestine immigration has been referred to as ‘illegal immigration’ in all the legislative instruments the EU has enacted. Although it is true that in some Member States, an irregular entry or stay constitutes a crime and in others, the term ‘irregular’ has no legal or semantic significance, in many other Member States, an irregular entry or stay does not constitute an unlawful act, which is why we should not generally criminalise these activities. For this reason, in the explanatory statement of the report, it is asked that the institutions revise the terminology that is used, insisting on the need to find a more precise and appropriate definition for the phenomenon of clandestine immigration. Moving on to the substance of this issue, the immigration liaison officers’ network was created by Council Regulation (EC) No 377/2004. This instrument states that the liaison officers will be representatives of a Member State posted abroad by the immigration service or other appropriate authority with the aim of establishing and maintaining contact with the authorities of the host country, aiming to contribute to the prevention and combat of clandestine immigration, the repatriation of irregular immigrants and the management of legal immigration. Since the enactment of the regulation, the Frontex Agency has been established, whose mission is to coordinate operational cooperation between Member States in the area of external border management; assist the Member States in the training of national border guards; carry out risk analyses; monitor the development of external border control and surveillance research; assist Member States in circumstances that require increased technical and operational assistance at external borders and provide them with the necessary support in the organising of joint return operations. It is evident that the important mission entrusted to Frontex could be achieved in a more efficient way if they could draw upon the knowledge and experience of the immigration liaison officers’ network, especially if we take into account the fact that the European Agency does not have offices or representatives outside EU territory. The proposed amendment to Regulation (EC) No 337/2004 aims to harness the knowledge and experience of the immigration officials for Frontex and vice versa, which was not included in the original regulation. Furthermore, the proposed amendment suggests accessing the information obtained by the liaison officers’ network through ICONet, which is a secure information and coordination network for the immigration management services of Member States, accessing the External Borders Fund to promote the creation of liaison officers’ networks and, finally, facilitating a mechanism for the presentation of reports on the activity of the network and the designation of named regions of interest in the area of immigration. The relevant legal bases of the proposal are Article 63(3)(b) and Article 66 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. I will stop there, Madam President, and will make further observations in the second round. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
rapporteur.

Madam President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your words, and also for your commitment. I would once again like to express my admiration for the way that you are managing the portfolio with which you have been entrusted. There have been 18 speeches this afternoon, and the majority groups have supported this report. I would therefore like to reiterate my deep and heartfelt gratitude, because they have participated actively, enriching and amending substantive issues that should be included and are now included. I am essentially referring to the human rights chapter, the European Asylum Support Office and the role of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Obviously, in such a broad and diverse Chamber, we are not obliged to agree with one another, which is why the efforts that we have all made to reach a very broad consensus are particularly significant. Ladies and gentlemen, from a centre-right and Christian Democrat position, I am indeed saying that I am unequivocally in favour of the expression ‘irregular’, and that I reject the expression ‘illegal’, as legally, semantically and ethically inappropriate. Thank you very much to all my fellow Members for their support, and also for their speeches, including the dissenting ones. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra  (PPE

Madam President, in order to mitigate the social and energy impact and to ensure secure energy reserves, we have tabled three amendments in plenary with the following aims: firstly, for the overall volume of aid per year to diminish, but with no percentage limit or limit per business. In this respect, we are grateful for Mr Langen’s position regarding removing fixed references and each Member State being able to decide according to their interests. The second aim is for aid to cover exceptional costs to be extended to 2030. Such proposals will help to alleviate the energy dependency of numerous EU countries, including Spain. They would ensure the continuation of indigenous production and the preservation of thousands of jobs on which significant regions of Spain and of Europe as a whole are largely dependent.

Mr President, I would like to make an announcement to the House. The Taiwanese Government has informed the Council, via the permanent representations, Parliament and the Commission, that from today, 11 November, it is establishing visa exemptions for Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania. Consequently, all 27 EU countries can enter Taiwanese territory without a visa. When the House votes in a moment, Mr President, I will take the opportunity to congratulate all the political groups for the support that they have given to this matter, as well as the Taiwanese people, the Taiwanese authorities, and their extremely strong diplomatic team.

Madam President, freedom and security are essential elements for the implementation of any current democratic legal structure, in which freedom uses security as the most valued tool for protection. The transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to third countries is an essential element of the transnational fight against terrorism and organised crime. It should be based on scrupulous compliance with EU rules on the protection of personal data, as laid down in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. For this reason, we must welcome the communication from the Commission on the global approach to transfers of PNR data to third countries and its recommendations that the Council authorises the opening of negotiations in this area with Australia, Canada and the United States, as both instruments take up Parliament’s concerns regarding security, defending fundamental rights and protecting personal data. However, it should be pointed out that PNR data cannot be used for profiling, which is why the Commission sought to clarify – in my view, successfully – the differences between the expressions ‘risk assessment’ and the aforementioned profiling. Moreover, the Commissioner said that checking will be done by humans rather than being automated. Well, we will see what happens. Madam President, we need a single, general, legally binding agreement to protect personal data. This top-level agreement must be implemented through sectoral agreements in order to combat terror and organised crime. As regards the need, Madam President, it is obvious. As regards proportionality, it must, in all cases, be an inalienable requirement. Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra,  
rapporteur.

Commissioner, I would also like to send my regards to your excellent team. Ladies and gentlemen, Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the Union’s external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 that we are discussing today has three objectives: transferring Taiwan to the positive list, transferring other third countries or territories – Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau – to the positive list and the situation of the Northern Mariana Islands. The situation of the Northern Mariana Islands does not pose any problems, as its inhabitants are, as you are aware, US citizens.  With regard to the requests to transfer the third countries that I listed, the Commission finds no justification for removing the visa requirement, and neither do we. In the case of Taiwan, this Asian island has experienced commendable democratic, social and economic development. Democratic institutions have been firmly established since 1996, when the first direct presidential elections were held. The President is the Head of the Government, and is elected by the people of Taiwan via universal suffrage for a four-year term. Legislative power currently lies with the Legislative Yuan, which has 113 members. Economically, Taiwan’s income per head of population is one of the highest in the world at USD 30 100, in July 2010, unemployment stood at 5.2%, way below the European average, which was 10.1% in the same month. During the first quarter of 2010, economic growth hit 13.27%, whilst during the first half of 2010, the balance of trade surplus stood at USD 12.1 billion. Figures published by the International Monetary Fund in 2009 placed Taiwan’s economy 25th in the world, with a gross national product of USD 379 billion. It should be pointed out that in 1950, Taiwan was poorer than Ghana, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Until 1960, it was more reliant on commodities exports than countries like Kenya, South Africa and Lebanon. Today, however, products manufactured in Taiwan account for more than 97% of the country’s exports. All this has meant that Taiwan’s net migration rate stands at just 0.15%. For this reason, it is very unlikely that we will have to deal with any illegal immigrants from Taiwan. According to data supplied by the Commission, in 2006-2008, only 45 illegal immigrants throughout the entire European Union were found to have come from Taiwan. As far as the security of travel documents is concerned, I would like to point out that Taiwanese electronic passports meet all the anti-counterfeiting standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The situation of dispersed Taiwanese should be looked at closely, as even if they have passports issued by the authorities, they need prior authorisation to enter Taiwan. For this reason, it would seem logical for the European Union to maintain a similar approach regarding those people, as my report proposes. Currently, Taiwan does not require visas from the majority of the Member States, except for Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria. The Taiwanese authorities have nevertheless undertaken to ensure that a visa waiver is in place for nationals of those countries by 11 November, in other words, tomorrow. This is a formal commitment of which the Presidency of the Council, the European Commission and Parliament have been notified, along with the permanent representations of the countries concerned. For this reason, Mr President, and for other reasons which I shall mention in my second speech, it is worth us granting the visa exemption to Taiwan, as the United Kingdom and Ireland did last year.

Mr President, noblesse oblige
, so I would like to start by saying that I am infinitely grateful for the support that all fellow Members representing their political groups have given to the report that I have had the honour to present to the House. I would also like to thank you for supporting my work. It would not, however, be fair if I did not say that the person mainly responsible is Commissioner Malmström, whose support, energy and excellent team have made it possible to drive forward this action, which I would describe as an act of justice. There is nothing more to be said, Mr President, except to add that I would also like to congratulate the people of Taiwan, the Taiwanese authorities and, of course, the excellent team of diplomats that Taiwan has in the world, particularly in Brussels.

Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Fajon on producing a report that involved so much commitment in such a determined way. I would also like to congratulate my colleague and friend, Mrs Corazza Bildt, for her determination and passion in taking on the commitment of visa exemptions for Bosnia and Herzegovina and for Albania, two countries that desperately need them. Like you, I, too, was in Sarajevo and Mostar during the war, and I too witnessed Milosevic’s mass population displacements and the solidarity of the Albanians. That is why I am expressing my joy here today, Mr President, because, happily, justice is being done. Since the Salonica Summit in June 2003, when the European Union at last took the welcome step of committing to exempt the Western Balkans from visas, following the first stage when the two countries did not fulfil the requirements, we can now reaffirm and welcome the commitment that finally, Albanians and Bosnians are going to be able to travel to EU territory. Mr President, Commissioner, the need to bring stability to the Balkans, especially to countries that will certainly join the Union in the future, and to facilitate the mobility of a population that is currently isolated, must, in my view, be one of Parliament’s political obligations.

Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to condemn the degrading and anti-democratic treatment by Hugo Chávez’s government of those who defend freedom and human rights. The detention of my colleague, Mr Iturgaiz, at Caracas airport cannot be overlooked. It is not the first time that the regime has launched an attack on members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Our mission as Members of this House is not limited to within the EU. It also involves promoting the values on which the Union is based such as freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. It is evident that this task is not well received by those that seek to impose totalitarian ideas on their citizens. The result of the parliamentary elections held on 27 September leaves room for hope, although we should all be concerned about the reaction to the progress made by the Venezuelan opposition. What can we expect from a government that harbours terrorists from the Oker terrorist cell, of an executive body that includes an alleged ETA murderer as the head of security of the Venezuelan National Land Institute, or of a government that ignores extradition requests for numerous terrorists who have fled justice? Obviously, we can expect nothing. Madam President, such contemptible attitudes deserve a strong reaction and the firmest possible rejection by Parliament. President. -

 Mr President, the security situation in Iraq is growing more precarious by the day. Since Major-General al-Karawi was killed in the Anbar province last December, violence in the region has peaked with clashes between government forces and ISIL. Fallujah is under siege, cut off from humanitarian supplies, and its residents labelled terrorists by their own prime minister, which is ludicrous. And it is not just Sunnis who are targeted but other minorities too. In Camp Liberty members of the Iranian Resistance, whose asylum-seeker status has now been officially recognised by the United States in addition to the European Union, live at the mercy of Prime Minister al-Maliki and those who control him from Tehran. We know that a new massacre is being planned by Prime Minister al-Maliki in Camp Liberty. Heat-oriented missiles have been transported to Baghdad by Iranian Quds forces in collaboration with Prime Minister al-Maliki. We know it. The High Representative knows it and I suppose that the President of the Council also knows. Inaction or soft diplomacy is not an option when three thousand men and women are under deadly threat. It is time for the High Representative and the Member States to do something effective for once. (Applause) President. -

In relation to this, Baroness Ashton, I ask you immediately to do the following. Tell Prime Minister Maliki that, if there is another murder or the seven hostages are not freed, this will have severe consequences at a diplomatic, financial and political level for him and we will take him to an international court to answer for these crimes.

 Mr President, Mr Juncker, if I remember correctly, you are currently the most senior member of the prime ministers of the European Council. You have seen my country, Spain, evolve from being part of the euro solution to being a founder member, and to today unfortunately being part of the euro problem, due to the government’s mismanagement. The Spanish Government has undertaken some reforms, but these are clearly still not enough to regenerate confidence in our country, confidence that existed in the past and that will exist again in the future. What advice would you give the next prime minister following the forthcoming elections in Spain? What reforms do you believe we should continue to carry out in Spain in order to recover confidence in the euro area, over which you preside? Antonio López-Istúriz White  (PPE
).

Mr President, the European Union is founded on values such as equality, solidarity and respect for all languages. We all share these principles. As Spanish Members, we support the idea of having a patents system for the whole of the European Union, and I congratulate my colleague, Mr Lehne, on that part of the report. We support anything that improves and expands the internal market. However, for such an important matter, a course has been chosen that is provided for in the Treaty – enhanced cooperation – which should be the last resort and fulfil a series of conditions. In our view, enhanced cooperation, on which we will vote tomorrow, is contrary to Articles 118 and 326 of the Treaty. Moreover, I believe that in the Council, the rules of the game have been changed, but my government will deal with that. The new Treaty is an unquestionably useful tool for the EU, but it cannot be used to establish a multi-speed Europe. Many countries that currently support enhanced cooperation will soon suffer the consequences themselves and, if the Council and the Commission continue to use enhanced cooperation in this way, ultimately we will all lose. Spanish is spoken by 850 million people. Out of the three languages proposed by the European Commission for the patents system, only one of them is comparable to Spanish in terms of size. What criteria were used? Efficiency? Are we talking about EUR 1 850? Then why not use only English and leave the other two languages, so we will also save by doing it three times rather than 20 times. Is it about timing? It was not Spain that opposed a patent in the past, it was other countries, which are now rushing to have one. Is it to do with politics, as I suspect? Care should be taken with bureaucratic manoeuvres that distance millions of citizens – and thousands of businesses that use Spanish – from the reality of the European Union. The system proposed by the Commission is contrary to the right of Europeans to express themselves in their language, it prioritises one language over others, it is clear discrimination against competition, it fragments the market and creates legal uncertainty. This battle has only just begun. Due to the haste of some, we are going to be faced with a legal action lasting several years in the Court of Justice, as my government has already said. The three institutions will have to give an account of the procedure followed and of why the warnings were ignored. This situation can be remedied if we return to the spirit and the letter of the treaties, which Spain has respected. Antonio López-Istúriz White  (PPE

Mr President, I think that all of us who believe in the European Union have reason to congratulate ourselves, particularly in these times of economic and sometimes political crisis. I believe that we have moved forward. We are taking a big step with the creation and launch of this European External Action Service. I would like to congratulate not only the High Representative, but also those involved – such as, for example, within the European Parliament, our colleague Mr Brok – who have facilitated the achievement of the agreements that were necessary for this. I especially liked the phrase that you used, Baroness Ashton, about how it is the interests of the European Union that need to be defended above all. I would also say to you – this is not advice, simply a comment – taking the position of my colleague, Mr Salafranca, that what is needed here is effectiveness. Moreover, I would add humility and effectiveness, following the example that the President of the Council, Mr Van Rompuy, is giving to us. I am sure that you will succeed and, of course, as General Secretary of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to give you my support, together with that of our entire group, in this enormous task that you are faced with.

 Madam President, I am addressing my speech to Orlando Zapata’s mother and to those suffering along with him in the fight for freedom in Cuba: they are not alone. Today, through this resolution – for which, in my capacity as Secretary-General of my party, I would like to thank the authors, and especially all the parties that have signed it – Parliament is speaking out as one against this isolated and decrepit dictatorship. Today, we are signing the beginning of the international death sentence for this regime. I am convinced, based on the majority of the speeches that I have heard, that we are all united in firmly and clearly condemning the death of your son. Many of us, however, are going further than this statement: you can rest assured that we will remain vigilant in order to secure the unconditional release of all political prisoners on the island. We will remain vigilant regarding the situation of human rights violations on the island. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will, of course, fight to maintain the European Union’s common position, and I am sure based on what I have heard that many others will do the same. We will not give mixed signals, but rather a clear guide for achieving our dream of seeing a democratic Cuba. The supreme sacrifice made by Orlando has produced a response in the good consciences of the whole world. Let us ensure that the silent sacrifice of thousands of Cubans is celebrated in the near future in a free Cuba. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo

 Mr President, allow me to begin by expressing my thanks to the Secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, particularly Ms Leffler and others who collaborated with me to make this report possible, including Ms Martín, Mr Kox and Ms Remacle. Mr President, it is almost over a year since the Committee on Petitions decided to draw up a report on waste management in the EU. The decision was taken after it was established that large numbers of repeat petitions were being put forward, condemning the poor waste management carried out by the authorities, the location of certain rubbish dumps, the destruction of some natural areas, and so on. The Committee on Petitions was sensitive to these claims, and sent several fact-finding missions to the areas concerned in order to verify in situ
 the truth of the complaints made by the petitioners. All of this has led us here today, to the plenary session of the European Parliament, in order to make it clear that the proper application of current legislation by Member States is an unresolved issue that requires particular attention and on which we should remain vigilant. As I said at the beginning of my speech, most European citizens expect public authorities to provide efficient and effective public services in terms of health, education, transport and security. However, the issue that provokes a growing number of petitions is the apparent inability of public authorities in many countries to deal satisfactorily with the problem of waste management. The European Union has adopted a broad raft of legislation, applicable in all Member States, in order to ensure that the legal framework exists to deal with the inevitable result of our modern lifestyle in terms of all the things we discard as waste from our household, from our place of work, from our hospitals, from our industries and so on. It is obvious to all that failure to manage such issues, and failure to prioritise efforts in this respect, produces not only negative effects on human health and well-being, but also on the viability of the planet and its environment. Judging by the petitions received, the concern of many local communities is growing, and this indicates that waste management is becoming a major political and social problem and people expect the European Union to deal with it somehow. An analysis of the waste management policies implemented in the Member States provides very contrasting information and serious breaches of EU legislation. The Commission reported in January 2011 that 177 infringement cases concerning landfills had been launched since the deadline for implementing the Landfill Directive in 2001. They had furthermore calculated that there were at the very least 619 illegal landfills still being used in the EU. In its strategic report on the prevention and recycling of waste, the Commission clearly demonstrates that it is using its best efforts to address the issue of waste management, and it also outlines its medium-term proposals. It should be recalled in this context, Mr President, that the large number of infringement cases mentioned aim at ensuring legal compliance, yet from the petitioners’ perspective, more effort needs to be made to ensure proper follow-up actions in the actual implementation of the law. Closely linked to the waste management process, although upstream of the process, are the EU directives dealing with environmental impact assessments and the access of citizens to information concerning the environment. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Georgieva for her interesting opinions and also my fellow Members who have participated in this debate. To some of the latter, I would like to say that comments have been made about the appropriateness or otherwise of holding this debate in the Committee on Petitions, and of referring the matter on from that Committee to this House. With your permission, Mr President, I would like to commend and defend the Committee on Petitions as an appropriate setting in which to debate these issues. I say this given that those who submitted petitions, the citizens of the European Union, have addressed the Committee on Petitions. Apart from the fact that citizens can address other committees, such as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and bearing in mind that opinions may be developed and reports drawn up in other committees, I think that when citizens approach the Committee on Petitions, they want us to respond and provide a solution to their problems. Clearly, we cannot look the other way or divert attention. Were we to do so, there would be no point to the work and actions of the Committee on Petitions within the European Parliament or, indeed, to the very existence of that Committee. In addition, I would like to say to certain colleagues that the petitions have referred systematically to the constant deficiencies that occur with waste management and to the real, habitual inability of the Member States to fulfil their legal obligations. This really is the way things are at present. These thoughts and problems have also been included in the report, however, hence the request for the Member States to transpose the Waste Management Directive without further delay, and to guarantee that all its provisions are fully complied with, especially through the establishment and application of comprehensive waste management plans. Therefore, Mr President, I believe that through this report and Ms Georgieva’s own words, a very direct course has been set to try to resolve all the problems that have been outlined by the groups, many problems that are related to this issue, but I also believe that it needs to be emphasised that delaying is not an option, nor can a blind eye be turned, when it comes to resolving the many, many issues and petitions that are being received from countries throughout the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pass on a message to you all from Oswaldo Payá, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize by Parliament. ‘Dear friends, the people of Cuba want change, they want to enter peacefully into a new phase of their lives, leaving behind anything that involves hate, violence, repression, lies and fear, opening themselves up to reconciliation and ready to take the path of progress in every respect. These changes, which are being imposed on us by law, are already present in the hearts and minds of the Cuban people, but the civil and political rights of the people need to be respected. There need to be free and democratic elections, and freedom to travel, work and participate in the economic, political and cultural life of the country. Changes are rights, and those rights are lacking in Cuba, where many people are still being persecuted for promoting the rights of the Cuban people and also imprisoned for that cause. The European common position is focused on solidarity and that position should be maintained. You should know that although the Cuban Government is not initiating the changes that many Cubans who are supporting the Varela Project and other civil initiatives desire, there are people working to achieve these peaceful changes at the moment. These are the initiatives that you must support, while remaining consistent with the common position so that it is also a joint approach.’ Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, it is my pleasure to come here, as we do every year, to present the annual report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions during the year 2009. As you know, this year, the activity of the Committee on Petitions was marked by the change from the sixth to the seventh parliamentary term, which has meant significant alterations to the composition of the committee, since two thirds of its members are involved for the first time. The report aims to offer a clear vision of the activity of the Committee on Petitions during the year and, ultimately, a more specific explanation of what submitting a petition to the European Parliament involves, as well as the possible result of the process, what it can achieve and its limitations. This report also examines the progress made in applying previous recommendations whose objective was to improve the committee’s work, and highlights the main challenges for the future in light of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, as well as confirming the right to petition the European Parliament as one of the pillars of European citizenship, has also established the necessary bases for increasing public participation in the European Union’s decision-making process, offering Europeans the opportunity to suggest improvements or additions to the Union’s legislation. To this end, the Committee on Petitions welcomes the fact that it is able, under Rule 50 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, to work alongside the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on drawing up the report on the European Citizens’ Initiative, which should be finished late this year. Moreover, following the same context of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament’s Committee on Petitions should forge closer working links with similar committees in Member States’ national and regional parliaments in order to promote mutual understanding of petitions on European issues and to ensure the swiftest response to members of the public at the most appropriate level. I would also draw your attention to the legally binding force acquired by the Charter of Fundamental Rights with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and underline the importance of the Charter in making fundamental rights clearer and more visible to all Europeans. I trust that all necessary procedural steps will be taken to ensure that the institutional aspects of EU accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will be taken. This goal is of vital importance if we take into account the problem of violations of property rights that the Committee on Petitions faces in certain Member States on a daily basis, knowing that neither the committee nor Parliament is in a position to take any legal action. I would also stress the excellent relations that Parliament has with the European Ombudsman. We particularly appreciate the efforts of the European Ombudsman to raise public awareness of its work, as well as to identify and resolve cases of maladministration by the European institutions. To this end, we support the idea that the European Ombudsman should establish an administrative code of conduct for the European Union administration. We call for the development of an online system that clearly indicates the various complaints mechanisms available to the public and which of these is most appropriate to their interests; the establishment of an online one-stop shop would be needed in order to achieve this. However, not everything was going to be positive. I would like to take this opportunity to protest at the practice – which has been constant since 2007 – of the Directorate-General for the Presidency and the Directorate-General for Communication, whereby items that are not petitions are registered as petitions, according to Rule 201(1) of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. I am talking about the so-called ‘non-petitions’. Processing them is an unnecessary waste of time, on top of the cost of dedicating staff to this. In order for you to realise the importance of this point, I will give you one figure: these so-called ‘non-petitions’ are up to 25% of the petitions registered. The practice of such maladministration endangers the rights of EU citizens. Finally, but no less important because of that, I would point out the need to adopt a code of conduct for the internal processing of petitions. To this end, I would encourage the secretariat and the representatives of the political groups to work on drawing up a revised guide for the benefit of Members on the internal regulations and procedures of the Committee on Petitions. In conclusion, my final words – and how could it be any other way, Mr President – are of thanks to the committee’s secretariat for its work and support in drawing up this report. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, thank you to all of the Members for their contributions. I believe that there is a thread running through all the speeches given by my fellow Members. This thread is the importance of the Committee on Petitions, because the faith and hopes of thousands of Europeans that their principal and real problems can be solved often rest on this committee. That is why, of all the committees, the Committee on Petitions – and several Members have said this – is the one that has the most direct relationship with the public, as Europeans are directly involved in it. The significance of this committee means that it must be safeguarded and loose ends tied up, so that all of us – Parliament, the Commission and the petitioners – may feel that the committee is even more useful. With your consent, Mr President, I will finish by asking the Commissioner to take note. I know that the Commissioner will do so, because many of the complaints that we have heard from fellow Members are completely justified. The following comments that have been made are totally justified: there is a lack of information, and it is true that certain petitions have been paralysed and were not completed. I therefore believe that we must not be distracted but must see the issue through to the end. Those petitions that have been initiated, and which remain open and with unresolved issues, must be resolved. I believe that in your capacity as Commissioner, you must make efforts to try to solve the complaints that you have heard here in this House today. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

 Mr President, a Spanish Central Criminal Court judge has confirmed what many of us were already aware of, namely that Hugo Chávez, the President of Venezuela, cooperates with ETA and FARC terrorists. This proves that Mr Chávez is in cahoots with terrorists, that he gives sanctuary to murderous terrorists on Venezuelan soil, and that he helps them by bestowing official positions in the Venezuelan Government upon them. Essentially, Mr Chávez is cooperating with ETA criminals. As a Basque, a Spaniard and a European, I wish to denounce and condemn the appalling attitude of the dictator Hugo Chávez. I urge the European institutions to take all necessary measures to condemn Mr Chávez and thus also condemn his policies in support of terrorists. I would also remind Mr Rodríguez Zapatero’s government, which currently holds the rotating Presidency of the European Union, that there is no point in being friendly and wishy-washy with Mr Chávez as it has been to date. There is no point either in displays of affection, or in friendly gestures and cooperation, because when the Spanish Government goes back on its word and humbles itself before Mr Chávez as it has done recently, this is tantamount to punishing the victims of terrorism, disdaining the Spanish justice system and thereby punishing freedom and democracy. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE
).  
– (ES)
 Mr President, I regret that some of those present in the House today should opt to congratulate Mr Chávez, who is in cahoots with terrorists and has included ETA leaders in his government. My group and I, faced with a choice between Mr Chávez and a Central Criminal Court judge like Mr Velasco from a state governed by the rule of law, have no hesitation in supporting that Central Criminal Court judge. Furthermore, if Mr Rodríguez Zapatero were to stop being all matey with Mr Chávez and humbling himself before him, and instead treated Mr Chávez as what he is, a terrorist supporter, the credibility of Spanish foreign policy on the international arena would be enhanced. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to condemn in this House the continual provocations, abuses of power and threats by the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez. With his dictatorial method of government he is threatening, among other things, freedom of expression in Venezuela and democratic order in Latin America. President Chávez has closed down thirty radio stations and some television channels. He is threatening and punishing journalists in Venezuela because they do not support his autocratic regime. Because of all this, Mr President, it should also be pointed out that while there are power cuts, water shortages and food shortages in Venezuela, and poverty is continuing to grow due to poor management by the Chávez Government, the Venezuelan tyrant is trying to cover it all up by blowing up border bridges and threatening Colombia. He is praising international terrorists and aligning himself with the despotic dictators of the world, and his words and speeches are continual provocations and war cries aimed at destabilising the American continent. This is why Parliament, which is always committed to freedom and democracy in any part of the world, must strongly condemn the autocratic and dictatorial policies of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, I would like my first words to be words of congratulation, as is only right, to Mrs Paliadeli, on the report she has presented, first of all before the Committee on Petitions and now here in plenary. I would also like to endorse the very sensible comments made by Mrs Gruny and Mrs Mazzoni, my colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), but, Mr President, I would like to add that the role of the Ombudsman is essential in a democratic institution. That is the conclusion that we in the Committee on Petitions have drawn, during the many visits by Mr Diamandouros to present his annual reports, like the one we are today examining in this House, or other reports within his remit. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not propose to drown you in numbers. However, although progress has been made in the role of the Ombudsman, I have no doubt that if we were to conduct a survey of European citizens on the role of the Ombudsman, his work and his activities, we would unfortunately find that citizens see him as remote and, in many cases, are not even aware of his existence. Perhaps this is because the Ombudsman’s decisions are not binding, as he himself reminded us here, or perhaps because his work is very restricted as far as the Member States are concerned, as Mr Diamandouros has pointed out in this House. However, if we want to provide a service to citizens, then this institution – the European Parliament – and the Committee on Petitions must make an effort to strengthen and promote the work of the Ombudsman. While there are certainly many petitions, as has been pointed out here, especially on the lack of transparency, I am sure that the proper provision of information – such as the new website, which is now working, which I welcome – would make a much greater contribution, and I would like to insist on this point, to the objective that, I think, will be endorsed by all: that all citizens of the European Union should be aware of and be able to contact the Ombudsman. For this reason, I wish the Ombudsman all the luck in the world and every success, because his successes will be the successes of European citizens as a whole. Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would be pleased if certain left-wing Members of this Parliament who are issuing resolute condemnations of Honduras would issue similarly forceful condemnations of what is happening in Cuba, or what Mr Chávez is doing in Venezuela and in Latin America, because, unfortunately, some people still hanker after and support the Berlin Wall, the purges of Stalin and even the mummy of Lenin more than democratic elections in a country, as in this case in Honduras. Having said this, with the forthcoming elections, some serious thought should be given to what has happened in this Central American country. Mr President, presidential elections in Honduras were called 16 months ago. The members of the electoral court, which is the body responsible for managing elections, were appointed before 28 June – they were therefore appointed under Mr Zelaya’s mandate. The six presidential candidates went through the primaries procedure, and the majority of the candidates want the elections in Honduras to be held. Therefore, why do some people not want to recognise the electoral process, if it was the natural outcome, whether or not Mr Zelaya was in power in Honduras? On 30 October, the negotiators of both sides made a commitment, it is true, by signing an agreement, to seek a solution to the crisis. The agreement contained a set of key points supported by both sides. The negotiators of the deposed President Zelaya did not establish, however, who should head the government of unity. It is therefore clear that the European People’s Party is in favour of the elections being held, under conditions of transparency, democracy and freedom, and we are going to support them with observers from our group. Let us not forget that it was the mediator, Óscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, who requested that they should go. In reply to a question from the delegation for Central America, he answered that it was necessary to send them, because the Óscar Arias Foundation itself was going to send observers to Honduras. We are going to do precisely that, because the international mediator, Óscar Arias, is also requesting it. Carlos Iturgaiz Angulo  (PPE

Mr President, this summer, the terrorist group ETA murdered three people in Spain, three people who defended law and freedom: an officer of the national police and two officers of the civil guard. I would like to express our solidarity, support and care to their families. ETA is a criminal group that has no place in Europe, because in the European Union there is no room for radicalism, totalitarianism or terrorist murders. The European Parliament and all the European institutions should therefore continue to condemn the ETA terrorists and continue to work to remove and eradicate the cancer of terrorist attacks by ETA and its accomplices from our continent I therefore want my first speech in this first ordinary plenary sitting of the European Parliament of this legislature to remember and pay tribute to all the victims of ETA terrorism, to condemn the terrorist organisation ETA in this House and to ask that, as Europeans, we all work together, with the law on our side, to smoke out ETA and its supporters, for the good of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.

Mr President, I want to concentrate on Ms Patrão’s report on shark fishing, and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate her on her excellent work and her spirit of collaboration. Having said that, there are not many others to be congratulated, particularly the European Commission, because this proposal is a clear demonstration of what should never happen in the fisheries sector. Its partisan approach and the clear lack of consensus contradict the principles of the next reform, especially the bottom-up decision-making process involving consultation – of both the sector involved and civil society – in order to reach a compromise. Commissioner, a compromise on measures that have such a serious impact on a fleet’s future cannot just be a compromise between you and the NGOs. You have positioned yourself exclusively on their side and that means that the Commission is working in the interests of one part of civil society, yet there is no compromise with those who are affected. I, personally, have been very much involved in this matter and have worked tirelessly with the sector to convince it of the need to relax its initial positions so that no one could object to the final proposals. I have done the same with the NGOs, but it has proved impossible because they knew that the Commission was on their side. Why, therefore, would they want to seek a compromise? In relation to what you said about the international dimension, Commissioner, I have just attended a meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICAAT), at which every single resolution on sharks was rejected, including one like the text that you are proposing: the debate on it lasted not even a minute and, indeed, the European Commission did not even say anything. Therefore, Commissioner, do you believe that under these circumstances it is necessary to condemn a fleet in the face of its competitors? Would it not have been much better to wait for ICAAT to take a decision? I would like to ask you to state publicly here that no finning takes place in the European Union. This is because of the comments during the NGOs’ campaign of lies. I would ask you to state whether or not there is any finning in the European Union. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, I believe that the Commissioner is also here to answer our questions. I asked her to state publicly whether or not the removal of fins, or finning, is common practice in the EU fleet, as many Members have said. I would like her to say whether or not that is true. Carmen Fraga Estévez,

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the rapporteurs for their reports, but may I highlight the excellent collaboration with Mr Gallagher, which has led to the adoption at first reading, with the agreement of all the institutions, of measures that will enable swift action to be taken to put an end to unsustainable situations, such as we are experiencing with Iceland and the distribution of mackerel stocks. With regard to the Stevenson report on the common organisation of the market (CMO), I shall make particular reference to the chapter on consumer information, to which Commissioner Damanaki referred, in which I believe the compromises reached clarify and simplify the original proposal. Commissioner, I believe that proposal confused quantity of information with quality of information, since it would – as in the case of Article 42(2) – call for a whole series of data to be given, complicating and unnecessarily increasing the costs to the industry, without being of any relevance to consumers, who would also be incapable of assimilating so many details. We have also tried to find a balance between the interests of the various segments of the fleet and industry. For example, the obligation to show the date of catch is in the interests of the smaller-scale fishing fleets but is very detrimental for the other fleets catching fresh fish, without affecting the quality of the catch. Replacing it with the date of landing, as included in the compromise reached, gives the consumer the same guarantees while allowing the date of catch to be included as part of the voluntary information, if so wished. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I want to thank the Commissioner for attending. I hope he can hear me. I can see the Commissioner leaving, which is really depressing, as what he said and the solution he proposed in this notorious compromise he supports so much is a solution that is totally against the principles of the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU). That is why I would have liked the Commissioner to hear this debate. Moreover, the problem is that the Commission is handling all of this in a secretive, clandestine manner. It has been pure chance that some Members of Parliament, such as myself, have found out what has been going on. Neither the Commissioner for the Environment nor the Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries have ever been here to raise this issue when they know that the fight against IUU fishing is an absolute priority for us in Parliament. I would also like to know the reasons behind supporting the interests of countries involved in chartering ships, such as Brazil, New Zealand, Australia and the United States, when the price to pay will be to void Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, the objective of which is to combat illegal fishing. It will also weaken the European Union’s position in each and every international forum. That is the way it is. This issue precisely began to unravel in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). I also want to emphasise what has already been said, which is that this sets a very serious precedent, because all of this, as he said himself, will now be an issue for debate in all the international forums, especially in the regional fisheries organisations. Coincidentally, this will be discussed in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, given that it is one of the regional fisheries organisations where the most chartering occurs. It should not be forgotten that the philosophy on which the fight against IUU fishing is based is precisely the double safety net of state control over the port and flag state control over worldwide fishing catches. That is what has sown the seeds of panic in the exporting countries, which have suddenly seen the attractive EU market close. That is the root of all these problems. I hope, therefore, that this will be fully resolved by other means. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, unlike my colleagues, I believe that Parliament has managed to achieve a text for first reading that is very balanced between the measures needed for protection and recovery of the bluefin tuna agreed with the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), maintaining fleet activity and the strengthening of control measures. To do so, the Committee on Fisheries has removed some of the rapporteur’s extreme proposals, which would have led to the halting of the activity of the fleet of European vessels, and only European vessels, with the disastrous socio-economic consequences that would have been incurred. It is worth remembering that since 2006, there have been successive recovery plans for bluefin tuna, and as well as the fact that to change the game rules half way through and for only the European fleet would be unfair and discriminatory, it is doubtful the sustainability of the resource would benefit, given that the rest of the fleets could continue to operate. Lastly, I would like to insist on the need to shorten the period for the transposition of the recommendations adopted in the headquarters of the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) into EU law. In this case, the delay has been due to the incomprehensible opposition of the European Commission and some of Parliament’s groups to including provisions for implementing acts in the article of the regulation, which had reasonably been requested by the Council, with the aim of achieving legal security when it comes to the interpretation of particular technical aspects that could impede compliance with the control obligations set by ICCAT. Our political group, therefore, will oppose Parliament’s unilateral declaration proposed in Amendment 4. Carmen Fraga Estévez,

 Mr President, the fact that we are currently within the extension period of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Morocco is simply because the Commission did not fulfil its obligation at the time by requesting a negotiating mandate or reporting the agreement well in advance if it was not being fulfilled. This is nothing to do with the fishing fleet: they are neither responsible nor should they have to suffer the consequences. Therefore, I strongly advocate resolving this situation by ratifying it. I do not agree with those who oppose it, whether it is for the political issues in the Sahara, or the negative results in the fishing evaluation report. In that regard, I would like to refer back to 2006 and my report on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco when this Chamber was very firm both in terms of the benefits that the Saharan people should receive, as well as denouncing a disastrous negotiation, the loopholes in which have led to the poor results. I would stress, however, that I do not think any of these issues are going to be resolved by sending the fishing fleet home. On the contrary, I think we should look at the future of our fishing relationship with Morocco. Furthermore, Commissioner, we are again in the situation where there are less than three months of the extension period remaining and there is still no negotiating mandate. The sector is again plunged into uncertainty, but this time it has taken the initiative and acted responsibly alongside the Moroccan fishing sector and, with the agreement of their respective administrations, together they have drawn up an action plan for the future, which was delivered to you in Brussels last week. This is the reason why Mr Haglund, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and I, on behalf of my group, have tabled an oral question and a motion for a resolution which look to the future, a future based on new foundations which try to make up for the mistakes that were made and which have the approval of all interested parties. I simply request that the Commission is … (The President cut off the speaker) Carmen Fraga Estévez,

 Mr President, while we are waiting for proposed reforms of the common fisheries policy (CFP), the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wishes to express its alarm, once again, at the economic state of the fisheries sector. Until the proposal for its new common organisation of markets is tabled, the sector will continue to have almost no room for manoeuvre when setting prices. The rules on imports, many of which originate with illegal fishing, remain unfair competition for EU production: new monitoring obligations require companies to mobilise more of their resources and the general crisis does not exactly encourage increased consumption of quality products. To this must be added the upward trend in fuel prices, which is once again threatening companies that have already managed to survive the crisis of 2008. Far-reaching reforms of the CFP are envisaged and, in light of that, and in a context of ever decreasing structural aid, many companies could need liquidity to restructure or adapt themselves with a view to 2013. That is why we have tabled this oral question and this motion for a resolution before the House, given that this aid does not cost the EU budget anything and that, furthermore, the increase in aid being requested falls far short of the de minimis
 aid received by other sectors, such as transport or agriculture. We do not want to see ourselves in a situation like that in 2008, when we debated the package of measures adopted in extremis
 by Commissioner Borg. I would also like to say something to you, Commissioner: it is true that there are some Member States that will and others that will not be able to give this aid, and that, according to you, this will create disparity. However, greater disparity is created by the fact that some Member States do not cofinance the European Fisheries Fund, and that is something that is generally accepted. What needs to be proposed is aid, and any Member States wishing to defend their sectors will also be able to defend them. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I must begin by regretting once again the complications that this report has encountered because of the resistance of the Council and the Commission to accepting Parliament’s powers of co-decision. In this case, we have a proposal for Greenland, as an overseas country and territory, to be able to export under the same conditions as those applied to a European Union Member State. This situation would benefit both Greenland, which exports 87% of its fisheries products to the European Union, and the Union; Denmark in particular, which is the recipient of the majority of these exports. One of the conditions for including Greenland in the single market import arrangements is that it should accept EU health rules, and this does not pose a problem in the least. Despite the trade in fisheries products being subject to the common organisation of the market, the Commission, using the need for compliance with health rules as an excuse, tabled its proposal based on Article 203 of the Treaty, which meant a simple and straightforward consultation procedure for us. Both the Committee on Fisheries and the legal services pointed out this anomaly from the outset. However, as it presents no problems in terms of content, and given its importance to Greenland, we are allowing the report to be processed under the consultation procedure. Imagine our surprise when, just as we were about to vote on the text and without prior warning, the Council adopted a completely different proposal, with numerous changes attempting to obscure the clear link with the common organisation of the market and so avoid co-decision. Since Parliament had – as I said before – already adopted the text using the consultation procedure without any problems, such manoeuvring was uncalled-for. Nevertheless, as we were faced with a new text, and given the clear proof that the Council’s goal was to erode Parliament’s powers, we decided that, this time, we would use those powers to the full and request a formal opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs. In that opinion, the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs was – and I am quoting directly from the text – that ‘the purpose of the proposed decision is to require Greenland to transpose EU health rules as a condition for the application of the EU internal market rules as regards fisheries’, as specified in Article 3 of the proposal itself, which guarantees that the agreement’s rules will be adapted to the applicable rules established in the Union as regards animal health and food safety, as well as the common organisation of the market in fishery products. Consequently, the Committee on Legal Affairs came to the unanimous decision that Articles 204 and 43(2) of the Treaty, along with Protocol No 34, which includes specific arrangements and procedures for products subject to the common organisation of the market in fishery products in Greenland, should form the legal basis for the proposal. Therefore, as rapporteur, I drew up another draft report, modifying the legal basis. That is what we are tabling for adoption tomorrow and, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, it is our first reading. All, then, that remains is for me to tell the Commission and the Council – which I believe to be absent – that they now have an opportunity to correct and recognise the new legal basis, and, therefore, to consider this the first reading, as we will be doing tomorrow. The problem is with the legal basis and not the content. I call for this problem to be solved with a view to the future. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur. 
− (ES)
 Mr President, I should like to give special thanks to the Commissioner for the answer she gave to my question, saying that she would be ready to accept the change to the legal basis, and I hope that the Council will also follow the same line that the Commissioner has set out. In any case, I had been considering the possibility of asking for this report to be returned to committee before it reached the final vote, but I later thought better of it and realised that it could only delay even further this proposal, which I believe is positive for Greenland and for the European Union, and that it would be advisable not to delay it more. I hope, anyhow, that the Council will go along with the intentions of the Committee on Fisheries, which are entirely justified, and I hope that a solution will be reached, given that the only problem is the legal basis and not the content. In any case, I am pleased that we have achieved this result; moreover, we always have the option of going to the Court of Justice if we see that it is advisable to continue with this matter. Anyhow, we will demonstrate goodwill tomorrow, by issuing our opinion, and we hope that the Council will respond and consider this Parliament’s first reading, as I have said. Therefore, thank you to the Commissioner for being prepared to cooperate on this issue in a straightforward way, and thanks to all my colleagues who have worked on and supported this report. All that remains is to hope that the Council will go along with our intentions, which are justified, as I have said, and endorsed not only by the Committee on Legal Affairs but also by the legal services of the European Parliament.

 Mr President, the Protocol of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Mauritania is due to expire on 31 July 2012. In view of the importance of this Protocol, the Commission has already asked the Council for a mandate for its renegotiation. We have been informed that the Council is currently studying a mandate proposal and will decide shortly. On the strength of Article 218 of the Treaty, which grants Parliament special powers in the final approval of fisheries agreements, we have already voiced our intent to make full use of the possibilities granted to us by the Treaty and the interinstitutional framework agreement to participate in shaping fisheries agreements, with the right to full information on an equal footing with the Council. We believe we should be involved in the process from the moment when the negotiating mandate is approved. The Fisheries Commission has thus decided to introduce a new procedure starting with the Mauritania Protocol, whereby we will submit an oral question and receive information on the future negotiations from the onset of the process. The procedure will also allow us to produce a draft resolution setting out our concerns on the agreement in issue – in this case, Mauritania – with the request that they be taken on board by the negotiators and ultimately become part of the final Protocol. The agreement with Mauritania is crucial both for the country itself and for the European Union. For Mauritania, it represents 29% of the national budget; for the European Union, it is one of the three mixed agreements still in force, allowing the presence of several different modes of fishing in the country’s waters, all of them vital for EU fish supplies. The significance of this agreement and the experience we have built up have prompted us to put forward a number of suggestions that will be reflected in the common resolution set to be negotiated by the political groups in the coming days, and also to voice a number of concerns on the way in which the current Protocol works. These concerns include the following: Firstly, Parliament must understand the importance of securing the industry’s support for the financial contributions and their correct use, bearing in mind the needs of both the industry and the Mauritanian fishing authorities in making headway towards an advanced, sustainable fisheries policy. Secondly, the joint scientific committee has a key role to play and care must be taken that it fulfils this role properly, as it is the body responsible for assessing resources and issuing recommendations on the biological status of populations, and therefore on the fishing opportunities available to the different fleets operating in Mauritanian waters. Thirdly, more information is needed on the catches of other non-EU countries operating in the area, so that we can accurately establish the real fisheries surplus that Mauritania can offer the EU, while also ensuring that the fishing opportunities negotiated are in line with the actual needs of the fleets. This will avoid any temptations to pay for ‘paper fish’. Fourthly, it is important, as far as the fishing fleet is concerned, to ensure that the technical measures for the different fisheries are negotiated at the same time as the fishing opportunities, thus putting an end to the absurdity of paying for resources that are technically impossible to catch. Lastly, urgent clarification is needed of Mauritania’s use of the Protocol’s monitoring provisions as regards its preference for methods other than the vessel monitoring system (VMS), and also its varying standards on ship arrests. It is important that both parties respect the agreed terms for the resolution of disputes in connection with such arrests, which must be preserved in the new Protocol. Commissioner, for all these reasons, we will be asking that the Commission, as the negotiator, takes into consideration these and other concerns, which will form part of the common resolution set to be approved at the next plenary session, and which our institution will follow very closely. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.

Mr President, Commissioner, exemption from the rules of origin is based on a very serious calculation error by the Commission regarding its impact, not only on the EU tuna sector, which is very serious, but also on the Pacific region, which we are seeking to help. Meanwhile, the real beneficiaries are almost exclusively the greedy fleets from China and South-East Asia and their processing industries. The Directorate-General for Trade established this exemption based on the fact that Papua New Guinea does not have the fishing capacity to exploit its resources. However, according to the most recent data from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, there are 41 seiners under Papua New Guinea flags operating in the area, which, in 2009, had a catch total of almost 500 000 tonnes. Out of this catch, more than 75 000 tonnes ended up in the European Union (semi-processed and processed), which makes Papua New Guinea one of the six main exporters to the European Union. It is not, therefore, true, as you say, that in order to develop Papua New Guinea’s fishing sector, other fleets needed to be given free entry. Under no circumstances can the European Union shirk its commitment to sustainable development. However, we are seeing that, under the protection of this exemption, and in order to bring in Asian investors, Papua New Guinea has amended its legislation so that it is not possible to make complaints about environmental damage, and has implemented investment rules that allow local workers and cheap labour from Asia to be hired, along with the worst imaginable labour standards. If we add to this the fact that, in the regional fisheries organisation that I mentioned, Papua New Guinea is leading other countries in flatly refusing to sign up to any international rules to manage and control fisheries, the result is that, while the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries is going the whole hog to combat illegal fishing, others are opening their doors to it. Commissioner, I have just come back from the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, and I am well aware of the position that Papua New Guinea has taken. I therefore maintain the position of the Committee on Fisheries of asking for the exemption to be suspended in the review of the agreement that we are discussing. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, thank you very much to the authors of the reports for their excellent work. I would like to focus on management plans, although I will not go into any substantial aspects, as they have already been highlighted by the rapporteurs. Instead, I will refer to the significant institutional challenges they are creating, which must be resolved. After more than a year of negotiations with the Council, Parliament has quite responsibly decided to bring the reports to first reading with the aim of exerting pressure to break the current deadlock, which affects not only these two proposals but also all the others that are to be put before us in the near future. Parliament is willing to find a compromise solution with the Council and the Commission but the key requirement for that to happen is for the Council to acknowledge and accept that the basic core of long-term management plans must fall under the ordinary legislative procedure, that is, under the legal basis of Article 43(2) of the treaty. It is incomprehensible that before the Treaty of Lisbon, when the Council also had exclusive competence in matters of TAC and quotas, Parliament was asked for its consultative opinion, whereas now, the Council claims exclusivity on these same matters, even though, according to all legal advice, Article 43(3) must be interpreted restrictively. I therefore urge the Commissioner to take account of Parliament’s position, even if any proposals – and I believe Mrs Bilbao’s question on this particular point has not been answered – were to be withdrawn or replaced by new texts. Failure to do this will compel us to refer the matter to the Court of Justice and to block future long-term plans, which is to be avoided insofar as it is a basic instrument of fisheries management. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES) 
Mr President, allow me to express my gratitude to the Council and the Commission for arriving at this excellent agreement at first reading, and I would particularly like to thank the legal services of all three institutions for their cooperation and help in resolving the problems arising from the new committee procedure following the Treaty of Lisbon. I believe that we have reached a good compromise, especially as it represents significant progress compared with the current situation, although, as in any compromise, we have all had to make concessions and be flexible, in what has been an especially complex task, as the Commission proposal arrived before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This meant that at the same time, it had to be adapted to the new situation, in particular, to Articles 290 and 291 of the treaty, relating to delegated acts and implementing acts. As this is a transposition into EU legislation of recommendations issued by a regional fisheries organisation, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) in this case, but which will be followed by many others, Parliament’s objective was fundamentally to establish a mechanism which would enable the transpositions to take place as quickly as possible, preventing internal bureaucratic delays from preventing us from responding correctly to our international obligations, as has been the case so far. Therefore, the new wording of Article 48, following the compromise reached with the Council on the subsequent amendments to this regulation, will enable the Commission both to comply with the obligations imposed by the NEAFC and to adapt to new recommendations that may arise in the future, through the delegation of powers. It is true that the Commission wanted it to be possible to revise all the articles in the proposal through delegated acts, and the compromise agrees that this will be the case for the majority of the articles, except in areas such as the recording of catches, tranships, inspections or monitoring of infringements: in other words, fundamentally matters relating to control and supervision, which will remain outside the framework of the ordinary legislative procedure. In any case, Commissioner, Parliament commits to amending this procedure if it is shown that the inclusion of these aspects within the scope of the ordinary legislative procedure could endanger compliance with the European Union’s obligations and, especially, those of the Commission, as a contracting party to the regional fisheries organisation. This is why we consider that this compromise represents a significant step forward, not only in relation to this specific proposal, but in order to lay the foundations for future discussions between the Council, the Commission and Parliament on fisheries policy. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that I believe that the example set by this most recent regulation on the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), which we are going to adopt tomorrow, is not a good one, because what has happened is precisely what we want to avoid. The Commission put forward the proposal late and the procedure has changed, as we have changed from the consultation procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure, and the proposal as a whole has been changed in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. That is exactly what we are avoiding through this compromise. Through the new wording of Article 48 of the regulation, which is the article that provides for the amendment of the regulation in future in order to transpose the various NEAFC recommendations into EU law, in the majority of the articles, we have delegated powers to the European Commission. We have only maintained and preserved the ordinary legislative procedure in a few areas, which was the compromise with the Council. A significant step forward has therefore been taken to ensure that this functions in the future, but even so, Commissioner, I have made a public commitment here that if, in the future, it does not function adequately and we are prevented from fulfilling our obligations, Parliament will be prepared to revise the procedure. I believe that we have made quite a considerable effort, and I think that this is a significant step forward as a starting point. We are sure that the Commission will be capable of using the new powers that the Council and Parliament has granted to it. Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner. I am sure that this is going to work much better than what we had in the past. Of course, Commissioner, you are the one who is going to have the tools to ensure that this is the case.

Mr President, this report originated as a response to the frustration and lack of defence of the EU fishing sector. Commissioner, this sector is not asking for protectionism, what it is asking for at this stage, given the history of disregard by those in charge of the Directorate-General for Trade, is that it is not sunk even further. In this regard, we particularly support the request in the report by Mr Cadec that negotiations on the fishing chapters are transferred from the remit of the Directorate-General for Trade to that of the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, as is the case with agriculture, as we are also dealing here with products that are particularly sensitive, tuna being the classic case. On the subject of tuna, we have a scandalous example in the waiving of the rules of origin without the conditions being taken into account in the agreements with Papua New Guinea and Fiji, which only serves to favour our main competitors: Thailand and the Philippines. Commissioner, are you aware that, in addition to strangling the EU sector, thanks to your policy, Papua New Guinea is entering a phase of very low-quality job creation and zero sustainable development? Are you aware of the reports by non-governmental organisations operating in the region of child labour, insanitary conditions and lack of hygiene in factories, the disastrous environmental impact on the Madang coast and illegal fishing? Is it your responsibility to prevent this? Carmen Fraga Estévez,

Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work and on how easy he made it for all of us to work with him and produce a good report. We should be pleased because for the first time we are going to adopt a report on fisheries under the ordinary legislative procedure, at first reading and with the agreement of all three institutions. Parliament’s amendments were essentially aimed at incorporating the new recommendations that arose at the meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in 2009, as the Commission’s proposal only included the 2008 recommendations. They were also aimed at clarifying and specifying some definitions and technical specifications in order to ensure that the obligations of all operators and each of the Member States involved in bluefin tuna fishing were crystal clear. The aim is that the origin of all bluefin tuna that comes to EU markets can be identified so that if this cannot be verified its sale can be banned. As the rapporteur acknowledges in his report, we have therefore arrived at the most comprehensive documentation programme in existence for any species. This means that we can send a message of confidence, while acknowledging that the international organisation that governs the management of bluefin tuna is very capable of reacting for itself in terms of monitoring its status and responding to networks for the illegal fishing of a species whose trade has reached a level of complexity that surpasses that of any other species. Despite the criticisms, without the knowledge and experience acquired by ICCAT it is more than doubtful that any other organisation would be able to take the same type of measures as swiftly and with the same knowledge of the facts. We therefore trust that the entry into force of this regulation will not only help the recovery of the species and the fight against illegal fishing of that species, but also that it will help to reintroduce a minimum level of rationality and objectivity among the public, and especially within some non-governmental organisations. As the rapporteur said, the ball is back in ICCAT’s court, and I would like to add that it never should have left ICCAT’s court. I say this on behalf of my group. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE
).  
– (ES)
 Mr President, everything is at stake in this reform. If we are not courageous now, there will not be another opportunity to create a genuine fisheries policy and we will be partly responsible for its failure. The CFP has, for years, suffered increasingly justified criticism and it would be disheartening if, when we are being offered one last opportunity, this Parliament were to prove incapable of proposing alternatives to what we have criticised so many times, in particular, the obvious failure of the conservation and management system, as demonstrated by both the state of resources and the decline in the sector. I simply cannot understand any reluctance to clearly suggest alternatives, as discussed in this House in 1996, such as transferable quota systems or effort-based management, which have had such positive results and which could help to maintain the more industrial fleets at least. The report says that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution, but at the same time, it closes the door on the possibility that there might be other solutions. I do not understand the contradiction, nor do I understand why, if someone does not want to use an instrument, the solution must be to prohibit it for everyone. That is not protection of the weakest; it is fear on the part of some sectors that only see permanent subsidies as solutions. The CFP should also guarantee competitiveness in a globalised world of fisheries products. The market for these products will undoubtedly continue to grow but it seems that it will grow without us. The policies within the Union should be coherent and we must ensure that the trade policy and rules on origin, such as those that appeared in the new economic partnership agreements, do not destroy the competitiveness of Community fisheries without being anything other than mere gestures to third countries; otherwise, it is our fisheries sector that will suffer. Mr President, consensus is a good thing when it results in progress, but not when we remain motionless in the face of problems, and we have many problems to solve. Carmen Fraga Estévez  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I would also like to talk about commercial fishing species, and I would like to make it very clear that regional fisheries organisations are already responsible for managing and conserving these species. In fact, one only has to skim through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to realise that it is perhaps designed for elephants and polar bears, but it is not, of course, designed for commercial fishing species. I am not against protecting bluefin tuna, as that would be absurd, if only because of its importance to the fleet. I do, however, think that the measures need to be decided by bodies that have the best specialists in both managing fisheries and scientific research, because there is a reason why the CITES has to take external advice when it receives proposals on these species. I therefore think that the proposal to include bluefin tuna in Appendix 1 of CITES is unnecessary and unjustified, because it already has the measures imposed by International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). It is unfair, because it would gratuitously damage a fleet that has just embarked on a huge drive to reduce fishing, and even counterproductive, because it could give rise to an uncontrollable black market in bluefin tuna. I understand the enormous pressure that public opinion in general and this House in particular – as we are seeing – is experiencing from environmental NGOs. My political group has therefore decided to support inclusion in Appendix II as a compromise between the proposal of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and those of us who think that fisheries management cannot be snatched away from regional fisheries organisations. Our proposal is indeed based on the scientific advice to CITES. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) has recommended that bluefin tuna only be included in Appendix II of CITES, which demonstrates that many people have not even read the FAO report.

 Madam President, while illegal fishing in the Indian Ocean may be occurring, the Community fleet can certainly not be described as illegal, as has been suggested here. The Community fleet fishes within the strictest bounds of legality, with licences issued under the European Community – Seychelles Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which regulates and manages tuna fishing in the area. Secondly, all Community vessels are equipped with a satellite monitoring system, through which they can be located in real time and at all times by the fishing and military authorities. Thirdly, the Community fleet has observers on board and complies with a strict regime of providing information on fishing activity through fishing logbooks, catch samples and a ban on transferring goods at high sea, among other measures. Lastly, the entire Community fleet has been duly entered in the IOTC regional fleet register. I personally would like both the Commission and the Council to acknowledge that the European fleet fishing in that area is doing so within the strictest bounds of legality. Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries.

Madam President, thank you very much to the rapporteur and to the Committee on Budgets for accepting all of the amendments from the Committee on Fisheries. What is particularly important for us is the amendment calling for greater flexibility in the funding granted to Regional Advisory Councils on fishing. As well as being scarce, the funding is so subject to interpretations and to the discretion of the Commission that the Councils are prevented from spending even the little that they have; this request was made to us unanimously by the seven existing councils. One amendment that we consider particularly opportune calls for a comprehensive strategy to combat piracy that genuinely considers the situation of fishing boats, which are particularly vulnerable to these acts in all the world's waters. With regard to research and the Seventh Framework Programme, as in previous years, we have demonstrated prudence and asked that, now that fisheries research no longer has its own heading in the budget, at least the percentage of investment should not decrease, as all decisions on fisheries management hinge on knowledge of the environment and of marine species, especially given that one of our new objectives is to apply an ecosystem-based approach to all legislation in the Common Fisheries Policy. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Seeber. I would like to express a series of basic ideas that I believe are important. Firstly, a market in water cannot exist without greater transparency and a very clear idea of, and an obligation for countries to determine, where the water originates. Transparent management must be in place, along with knowledge of the water in the aquifers and how it is distributed. This process has not been designed; it is not yet a political tool and needs to be developed, as does aquifer control using a digital system. I also believe it is necessary to control the issue of shale gas and its impact on aquifers. I find it utterly dangerous and perhaps careless, and I am aware of the Commissioner’s interest in monitoring the specific impact of shale gas on aquifers. I also believe that, when it comes to drought, we have too many diagnoses and very few solutions. Any directive should relate to the agricultural production system and include solutions. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, there is an issue that concerns me: the fact that water is not a renewable product for many. Water is sometimes renewable, but not always. Many aquifers are not renewable, but water returns to the ground. The problem is that it does not always return to the same place it comes out; for example, the water that evaporates from the Mediterranean forms the rain that falls over Austria or Prague, and that aspect needs to be taken into account. I think transboundary water agreements are very good, and I think that the Commission should place much greater emphasis on them. As the directive lays down, a river has to be managed in a uniform and unique way, but this approach needs to be strengthened a great deal, and international relationships with respect to transboundary waters need to be promoted. That is essential in my view, and we will see it with Turkey, which will never agree, but we must insist. However, I think the monitoring of aquifers is very poor. The technology exists to monitor aquifers. Most damage is done through illegal extraction of water from aquifers. I therefore think it is vital that this aspect is taken on board, and technology exists for that. I also believe that the relationship between agriculture and water should be reviewed, because it should not be the case that crops that consume a lot of water are treated in the same way as those that do not. If we put a price on water, which I support in agriculture, and which occurs in my country and region, it should be taken into account that corn and lettuce, for example, consume much more water. We are then exporting water to all the countries to which corn or lettuce are exported. That needs to be reflected in agricultural prices. It is an issue for consideration. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Madam President, I think that Ms Gardini’s report is very good and a great effort has been made. However, I would have liked it to have looked not only at prevention, but also at what will happen next. One of the extremely serious problems in Haiti, for example, in Lorca during the recent earthquake, and in L’Aquila, is precisely that, while lives have been saved and life has returned to normal, there is a need to rebuild cities, cities that took years and thousands of years to be built. They have to be rebuilt all of a sudden. They have to be built, and there is a science and technology to help with this. It is not possible to build on just any ground after an earthquake. It is important to find out which ground is the most suitable. Where is the special European Union unit to coordinate all the knowledge within all the sections? We are told that the new cities must be energy efficient, that they have to be smart cities, but how does one make the transition from a destroyed city to a smart city? In this area, Europe has abandoned its people. It has not put in place any coordination measures, and there is a need, Commissioner, to coordinate the reconstruction work and ensure true flood prevention. There is a need to look at how to control the rivers. Other countries, such as Spain, have achieved this to a large degree. One cannot stop talking about a disaster the day after it has happened. This is why I am much more concerned about what happens next, and I believe that this is where Europe must start to act. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

(ES)
Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Matias for her report. I would especially like to say a number of things to Ms Geoghegan-Quinn: firstly, do not disregard small projects. Silicon Valley was built on small projects. Europe needs a great many of these so that small universities may be brought on board. Secondly, I believe that what Europe needs is human resources. Large projects should be tied to a scholarship programme so that more grant holders can go to large universities and institutes to receive training. I think both the Structural Funds and this system should pay less attention to buildings – Europe has a plentiful supply of buildings but is indeed lacking in human resources. I also believe, Commissioner, that you will find you have the full support of Parliament if Member States are also required, through the European Research Area (ERA), to simplify their procedures. Europe’s efforts at simplification should be met with transparent procedures on the part of the Member States, which will have to commit themselves, given that they will be receiving money. Commissioner, you will have Parliament’s full support if we aim to achieve simple, transparent Council procedures. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines,

 Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude for the work done in this report. However, I have to say that an agreement between the political groups has not been reached. This is a very significant report because it breaks the unity of environmental policy that has always existed in Europe. The break is a result of requests to which the Commission, of course, has rightfully replied. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is not totally united either. However, we have reached some basic agreements in which we understand, firstly, that the legal pillar cannot be changed as it puts the internal market in danger. The internal market is one of the most important values that we have achieved. It safeguards agriculture and our negotiations before the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Therefore, we want a report that, within the uncertainty it creates, is well-founded on an adequate legal construct. Secondly, we seek to strengthen the scientific nature of decisions. We have a large body, the European Food Safety Authority, which we cannot weaken by returning to taking decisions only from the criteria of national authorities. Therefore, we support the fact that decisions should be taken on a case by case basis, that they should not be subjective, and that we should also bear in mind we are now subject to grand populist policies and media pressure that can often make us lose sight of clear and objective scientific values. Finally, we want to say that is necessary to safeguard agriculture in Europe. It is necessary to strengthen Europe. I want to add something more: certain forms of nationalism are the greatest and most dangerous form of euroscepticism. I believe democracies based on national parliaments have been talked about here, and we must take into account that the joint European policy is also democracy and it has produced a major environmental policy. Therefore, the Group of the European People’s Party officially supports the report although there are groups, such as the Spanish delegation, that think differently. It is obviously going to support the Commission’s Dalli report but it is not going to support the Lepage report if our amendments are not adopted. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Mr President, thank you very much for your compassionate and supportive words. The Lorca tragedy is becoming clear. At the moment, we know that eight people have died, among them two pregnant women and a twelve year-old boy, more than 250 have been injured and 80% of houses are affected. That is to say, from now on and for the moment, many Lorca citizens will be homeless. A large portion of Lorca citizens have also lost their places of work and with them have gone their hopes, expectations and opportunities. Lorca is a city of 70 000 inhabitants, of whom 20% are immigrants that the city has received, taken in and been able to give a new life with new meaning. I know that together, the old and new residents of Lorca, with help from the institutions and from everybody, will be able to begin a new journey in their lives. I also have to say and call on the European Union not to leave anyone behind and to be able to help those affected, recognise their pain and stand by their side, opening their arms and offering opportunities. I would like to thank you all very much and to ask for a minute’s silence. (Applause) Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 Mr President, I must thank all my fellow Members who have understood the problem of the Mediterranean region, the Spanish delegation, and all those who understand that we in the Canary Islands, Murcia, Valencia and Almeria, in addition to being frustrated at the Commission’s failure to honour its agreements, and to having seen many companies forced out of business, remain the entry point for immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, the entry point for Moroccan immigrants, and a buffer against the crisis. This is because we are currently supporting, at a time of utter economic penury, people who come to work and are able to send money home to their families. Therefore, I believe that the Commission must also behave responsibly with regard to the competences granted to it by the Treaties. I believe the Commission has not given any thought to the need to defend the interests of the public, or to the need to prevent an indiscriminate policy which, moreover, makes us import produce grown in extremely dubious phytosanitary conditions.

Mr President, I would like to celebrate the fact that there is innovation, attention to innovation, and also partnership, but I would also like to say that we do not know what this thing is that we are talking about. We are talking about an initiative, but no one has told us about its content, its formula or its model. I would suggest that, first of all, if we want to be efficient, as some fellow Members in this House have said, we review the results of what has happened with the Institutes for European Training and Information (IETIs), the partnerships and the platforms. Now that we have had experience with the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, we need to evaluate these things objectively, with external evaluation, looking at the results. In the cases of some IETIs, for example, we have seen that they have ended up being dominated by large companies, and once again, small businesses have been left out. I would suggest that there be policies and formulas for innovation to see how we can help small businesses to get involved, perhaps sometimes through intermediary bodies that help them to pay for the projects or to carry them out. We cannot, however, carry on this way, leaving small businesses out. Secondly, we need to consider the need for innovation in administration, in other words, innovation in the management of innovation. This is because the market guides innovation, and administration is not used to following the market, which works much faster. We therefore need to do much more capacity building, innovate in capacity building and innovate in administration for research, in order to manage research and help businesses to get to work on this very difficult and complex undertaking for the future. Of course, we also need to incorporate the banking system in terms of the risks involved, which should not only be undertaken by the European people. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Mr President, I think that in the Year of Biodiversity, we have talked a great deal about the disaster that is happening, but very little about solutions. I think that society needs solutions and new ways of approaching the problem. Firstly, the division of Europe into bio-geographical areas should be translated into a specific policy because the problems in the different areas of Europe are not the same. We should therefore have a micro-policy on biodiversity, because biodiversity is a local issue. Secondly, it is terrible that we should be turning our back on all action regarding soil and the abandonment of agricultural soil when the trophic cycles of animals require a detailed study of each area. This has not been done. It is not well known that in many areas, by planting certain trees, there will be more birds and by planting certain plants, there will also be more insects. Experts acknowledge that the lack of insects is the great tragedy of the loss of biodiversity, especially with regard to birds. Nothing is being said about the problems with soil, insects and the organic richness of soil. It appears to be a crime to talk about soil in Europe. Finally, I would like to say that the landowners are essential. An amendment on stakeholders that I tabled in committee was rejected. However, if we have birds or animals, will the farmers who plant the plants that they come to eat not have something to say? Will the owner of their habitat not have something to say? Will farmers not have something to say? I think that this method of imposing ideological dictatorships needs to come to an end in Europe if we want to achieve better biodiversity.

Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the pupils of the European Schools, whose qualifications are not recognised by the Spanish Ministry for Education. They are nearly all children of Spanish officials, and are being discriminated against and treated unfairly. The equivalence table that is being used, which was recently consolidated by the Spanish Ministry, deducts half a point or one point from pupils who have studied at the European Schools. Moreover, these are boys and girls who speak languages. This means that when they try to apply for degrees that have a high cut-off mark, they remain outside the system. We believe that this is inherently unjust.
 Firstly, because Spain signed all the agreements and conventions and is not keeping to them. Secondly, because it is basic discrimination. A country cannot go on purporting to be European when really it is treating pupils from our European Schools unfairly and discriminating against them. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

 I would like to welcome Mrs Espinosa; I am very pleased that she is here. I am most concerned by the change in attitude, and the fact that our analysis of Copenhagen may well lead to a change in attitude. Firstly, I think that one of our problems is a lack of humility and realism, as my colleagues have already said. Above all, however, I am concerned that, when we have been to other countries, we have found that they do not talk about climate change but rather global change. The context in which we will be moving in Mexico, and the context in which we have been moving, is that of a growing population, a food shortage, a need for more agriculture, and limited land and water resources; therefore, any decision we take on climate change must be considered within that context. Of course, we must also remember that many countries have a right to develop. We thus need to take a systemic view, something that is lacking in our analysis of climate change. Climate change cannot be resolved on the issue of emissions alone. A sectoral, quantitative vision does not lead anywhere. What is more, we have to attach greater importance to science. In particular, I ask the Commission that those teams who tampered with data be checked and have their funding withdrawn, if the European Union is indeed supporting them, because this will discredit us forever. How are we going to coordinate on this matter? That is another very important question. How is the European Union going to organise itself in order to reach an agreement? We should have already started working on that this morning. Finally, the issue that concerns me: adaptation is carried out in the territory concerned, and we have to begin that process, once again, with a new, strategic vision of the territory; this includes productivity, strategic reforestation, regions, areas and districts devoted to agro-energy and, of course, water and biodiversity. We are lacking that vision. On this point, I think we need to think about the option of Structural Funds for new strategic plans in all regions in order to be able to carry out this adaptation; and decision makers should be invited to begin that strategic revision of the territory because we do not have responsibility for that area and it will be very difficult to work on it from Europe. Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, it concerns me that frequently a lack of coordination means that sustainability criteria are not applied to agriculture. I would like to ask two questions: firstly, at a time when we are experiencing desertification in southern Europe, which is seriously impacted by climate change, and given that land use is the most important thing, why is money being paid to pull up olive trees and vines? This means that Europe is paying to have more desert! Are you going to stop this? Secondly, the agreement with Morocco: if Europe is conducting a common foreign policy, it must defend the interests of its citizens and of European production. Europe is negotiating the agreement with Morocco on its knees, without taking into account the principle of reciprocity, without guaranteeing health and that insecticide and food quality programmes will be maintained. How is it possible that this process is not only opening the door to products on top of the quotas, but that it is also putting quality at risk? Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I am going to talk about two concepts, namely coordination and flexibility. A problem has been found with all the matters that were discussed in the Council. In recent years, there has been an extraordinary lack of coordination between the different Directorates-General in the Commission. Climate change policy has frequently been considered independently of the scientific knowledge of the Directorate-General for Research. It has also been conducted independently of land use, for example, which is linked to climate change. My first question is as follows. Are you prepared to organise and strengthen internal coordination, in such a way that, when we appoint our commissioners, we can be assured that internal coordination is guaranteed? My second question relates to the fact that we are talking about competitiveness, about an economic crisis. Is the Commission also prepared to be more flexible on some matters such as REACH and its implementation, which is going to cause extraordinary damage to our own competitiveness? Is it prepared to be more flexible? My last idea on this coherence policy is that we cannot talk about the economy and recovery without talking about opening up the energy markets. There are countries that do not have an energy market, such as Spain in the case of gas. This means that prices rise and development becomes impossible. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

Mr President, the rapporteur, Ms García Pérez, should be congratulated on her work and on the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council of Ministers. It is shame that the Council is not represented here tonight with us. The new quality system for agricultural products is a simplification of the current system and a streamlining of current authorisation procedures, and that is good news. It is also a good achievement to have included the obligation to use the Union logo for designations of origin and protected geographical indications, given that it increases the exposure of European products. I think it is also worth noting that the provisions for protecting quality designations in bilateral agreements with third countries are strengthened, and that a legal basis for defending the European Union logo in those third countries is created, as I honestly think that the protection of European products in third countries should be a fundamental objective. It is a shame that this package has been somewhat stripped back during the negotiations and, I will say it again, it is a shame that the Council is not here to hear it, because the original quality package proposed by the Commission has been rather forgotten and the marketing standards and management of supply through quality designations of origin have been cut from the agreement, leaving it, as I said, a little empty. I think the Council’s blinkered attitude on these two issues is regrettable, as they refused to listen to Parliament’s reasonable positions. Supply management by means of designations of origin should have been defended, and will of course be defended in the single common market organisation. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, through the assistance of the European Union, food banks have been carrying out notable and recognised social work, which must continue in the future with the full support of Parliament. Solidarity and social and territorial cohesion is precisely one of the fundamental ideas behind European integration. The existence of a programme such as this is therefore vital in order to help achieve this. The current economic crisis is hitting European citizens hard. Eighty million people are below the poverty line and 43 million people have to weigh up whether to include protein in their diet twice a week. We can use the European Union budget to make a cohesive effort, which includes the common agricultural policy item. Ladies and gentlemen, as Members of this Parliament, we must encourage any initiatives to continue the food aid programme in 2014, and throughout the coming financial perspective period. The European Parliament has to forge an agreement with the Council and avoid selfishness at all costs in favour of European citizens. Esther Herranz García  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, apart from the 80 million poor people we are talking about, a further 43 million people find it hard to manage to eat animal protein twice a week. This situation could become worse because these people  – the ones who have problems managing to eat animal protein twice a week – could find themselves in dire straits, as the economic crisis is becoming even more acute. This is not exactly the best time for the European Union to be cutting the food aid budget in the run-up to the next multi-annual financial framework period. The agreement, endorsed by Parliament, extends food aid under the conditions requested by this Chamber. It also represents, however, a certain level of resignation towards the block that some Member States have kept up for several months in the Council. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to urge all of you here to take whatever initiatives are necessary to keep food aid going beyond 2014. Parliament should not stand idly by in the face of such an important humanitarian issue. We should not accept the status quo, and this means we should use the negotiations for the next multi-annual financial framework period to express our opinion on this issue, and to push for an agreement between the Council of Ministers and Parliament to ensure that aid for the poorest can be maintained beyond that date. Food banks have been able to provide a noteworthy social service thanks to European aid, and this should not be paralysed through the selfishness of some governments. This service has benefited 13 million people, which has enabled us, with minimal effort, to make the common agricultural policy a bit more important. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, last year Parliament’s Committee on Petitions asked the European Commission to amend the entry price system for fruit and vegetables entering the Union. This system allows products from third countries to enter fraudulently, as the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) itself has stated. These products are primarily Moroccan tomatoes. The Governments of Spain, France and Italy issued a statement last year that made the same request. We can combat this fraud by amending the Regulation on application of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for agricultural products, because the problem will not be resolved by aligning the Customs Code, Commissioner. For several years I have been speaking up within the Spanish Partido Popular
 about the need to stop new concessions to Morocco until such time as the European Union has the necessary instruments in place to ensure compliance with the agreement currently in force. The European Commission argues that the Member States should control imports. However, what the Commission does not say is that the current entry price system prevents national customs authorities from being able to properly trace the prices declared by importers in order to check for irregularities. Amend the Regulation on the application of the CMO for agricultural products and part of the problem will be solved. If you do not, the legal loophole in European legislation will prevent national authorities from doing their jobs properly. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to thank my colleague, Ms Patrão Neves, because, during the last few months, she has defended against all opposition this resolution which we are debating today and which we will vote on later. Ms Patrão Neves, with the support of the Group of the European People’s Party, has had to face many obstacles and I should like to congratulate her on the work which has brought us to this point. Ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, farmers received 50% of the final price paid by consumers; but today, in many cases, they receive less than 10%. At the same time, in 20 years, the market share for distribution chains has risen from 21.7% to 70%. Something is going on, and it is quite obvious. Measures must be adopted to ensure that food supply chains are more equitable, more equal and fairer. Firstly, the security networks provided by the common agricultural policy to ensure fair prices must be improved. We need an EU framework to guarantee fair relationships and avoid abuse. We must define and prohibit abusive practices within these margins. We must make production more concentrated, encouraging producers’, farmers’ and livestock breeders’ organisations. We must also ensure fair competition conditions for all producers with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities. I am referring to those producers outside of the European Union who do not meet the same standards in terms of quality, food security, animal welfare and all these issues which are so essential that we require our producers to meet such standards. Where do we do all of this? Well, in the next CAP reform, of course. We must improve contractual relations in this CAP reform. The aim will be to improve the position of the primary sector within the chain, improve distribution trade policy, avoid the constant increase in food speculation, take into account and improve those margins which are causing a rise in non-agricultural costs, and, finally, assure producers that all products on the EU market meet the same quality standards.

 Mr President, Mr Cioloş, I am glad that you are here with us this morning, and I hope that today you will answer me a little more seriously and a little more clearly. In the proposed reform of the common agricultural policy that you presented to us on 12 October, you spoke of eliminating the sugar quota system, and you also spoke about ending vine-planting rights. Parliament, which has recently voted on the report by Mr Dess, is in favour of continuing planting rights beyond 2015 and not liberalising them. It also wants to maintain the sugar quota system until at least 2020. Are you going to support Parliament’s position and Parliament’s decision on these two issues? Esther Herranz García  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 If I have understood you correctly, Commissioner, given that there are now 15 Member States in the Council that think differently, as they did before, and given that Parliament is continuing its commitment to vine-planting rights, does this mean we can be relatively optimistic about the Commission’s proposal next year in the wine report? Esther Herranz García  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, this morning the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, brought this subject up in the debate on the state of the Union. That gives us an idea of the importance the Commission affords this issue. He spoke about hope, inclusion and solidarity. At a time of economic crisis such as this, when there are ever more unemployed people, and ever more people living close to the poverty line, this deadlock shown by some Member States is the most absolute example of a lack of solidarity. Those countries that are opposed, the richest of the European Union, may endanger the continuation of a programme that, with 1% of the common agricultural policy budget, helps 18 million people. The Commissioner is right to shame those Council members who are incapable of showing solidarity at this time. I urge the Polish Presidency, between now and the end of its term, to continue with its support in order to move forward with this programme. It deserves that. So do all the people who need it, and the EU also deserves that vote of confidence and, above all, that response to its citizens. The EU Council of Ministers should take into account Parliament’s view that the programme should not only be maintained but also improved, as this House called for yesterday. I would also like to remind the Heads of State or Government that we hope and trust that at the next summit they will take these matters seriously and find a political way out of this deadlock. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, though today’s debate focuses on this important report on the reform of the common agricultural policy, I should like to comment on a side issue that affects us and could affect the viability of the postulates we are defending in Parliament in connection with the reform of the future of the CAP. Next week, the European Commission will present its proposal on the financial prospects for the post-2014 period, in which, if my information proves correct, the Community executive is decidedly intent on proposing cuts to the EU agricultural budget. It must therefore be borne in mind that the European Commission will not take on board the opinion that we will adopt tomorrow, in which we specifically request the expenditure of the common agricultural policy to be maintained. I fail to see how, with a reduced budget, we will be able to rise to all the challenges described in that document; how common agricultural policy subsidies will be made greener, a process we want to ensure will not require an additional effort on the part of agricultural and livestock farmers; how we will be able to achieve this. I fail to see how, with a diminished CAP, we will be able to respond – just to give another example – to price volatility, and establish a budget line, as is our intention, that will rise to the crisis we have come to know so well. The CAP should not be measured merely in terms of expenditure because, in addition to the goods and services it provides, I believe it should be made clear – today of all days – that EUR 1 invested in agriculture generates EUR 10 of wealth in the agri-food sector. This should be very much taken into account when it comes to setting the next budgetary framework. Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that negotiations with third countries and with the World Trade Organisation pose a serious threat to the future of agricultural and livestock production in the European Union. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Mr President, one can only express a deep sense of sorrow for the 23 fatalities: 22 in Germany and one in Sweden. This crisis is clear evidence that the European Union has a long way to go in improving its food safety alert system and its internal coordination. The Member States involved have been slow, inefficient and inoperative in their reaction, and, at this point in time, with 23 people dead, we still do not know where the problem is coming from. The European Commission must think hard about the problems it causes with its irresponsible actions or its failure to act at times of crisis such as we are seeing now. These lead to cases of financial ruin, the destruction of previously stable jobs, unemployment, helplessness and, needless to say, an extremely hazardous public health crisis. While you in the Commission paid heed to irresponsible statements issued by regional authorities in Germany – statements that were totally misinformed and quite irresponsible – mentioning Spanish farms by their names and addresses, the population remained exposed, without knowing it, to the bacterium. Thus, in the belief that they were avoiding contact with it, the public were more exposed than ever to eating potentially harmful food. In the Council of Agriculture Ministers that will be held in Luxembourg at two o’clock this afternoon, the European Commission should propose that a portion of the EUR 2 500 million left over from the common agricultural policy be put to use. Those EUR 2 500 million should be used to redress, in so far as is possible, the damage that has been caused. To enable this, a suitable legal solution will need to be found, as was the case in previous instances, for example, the ‘mad cow’ and dioxin affairs. One such solution should also be found now. Commissioners, Ministers, your actions in Luxembourg today must befit the stature of your office. Furthermore, the German authorities, in view of their reckless accusations, should definitely support this financial solution from the very beginning, and use funds of their own to conduct communication campaigns aimed at restoring consumer confidence in horticultural products, which is now in shatters.

 Mr President, I would firstly like to express my gratitude to the Committee on Petitions for its hard work following the complaint brought by the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants, based on the report published by OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, in 2007. I believe this report’s conclusions are extremely clear and justify only too well action on the part of the European Commission – which should have addressed this matter a long time ago – to clarify the operation of the entry price regime, at least in relation to the tomato sector. However, not only having failed to take any action to prevent the different types of fraud made possible by the current Entry Price Regulation, the Commission has negotiated a new agriculture agreement with Morocco without having first resolved the shortcomings of the import regime currently in place. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the European Commission to take its responsibilities seriously, to start investigating where and how fraud is being committed, and, potentially, to demand payment of any unpaid customs duties. I believe that there is no way that a new agreement with Morocco should be ratified until all the details we have set out are resolved. Our aim is not to hinder new international agreements, but to ensure that such agreements will not seriously damage the interests of European producers, and that the rules laid down in those agreements will be adhered to. Where the new agreement with Morocco is concerned, all the European fruit and vegetables sector is demanding is a guarantee that the terms agreed will, in fact, be observed. This will only be made possible by reforming the entry price regime. We cannot have a new agreement with Morocco until we have a new system for entry prices. We will not be able to ratify the agreement that the Commission has already concluded. Moreover, if this supervisory role is to be played by the Member States, they should be required to make a significant financial contribution. However, it is also true that we have long been calling for a European borders and customs system similar to that of the United States, so as to ensure effective control. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

Mr President, in January 2012, 400 Spanish egg producers could disappear, which is around 30% of the total number in my country, with the loss of the production of 300 000 tonnes of eggs. The European Union could stop producing the 80 million eggs, which amount to 2 million tonnes, and if we do not act very intelligently, the only thing that we would achieve would be that they would be covered by imports from third countries, whose animal welfare standards are much lower than those in the European Union. This 1999 directive, which requires that the space in cages for laying hens be increased, demands that we act intelligently and positively, because otherwise, we will only weaken European production and give extra trade opportunities to third countries where the amount of space per bird is much smaller than what we currently have in the European Union. This directive requires a great deal of effort from European producers, as in Spain alone, it is understood that the cost is around EUR 600 million. It should also not be forgotten that it has an economic impact that extends to the egg products industry and the food industry in general. I therefore ask for your support for the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to paragraph 2, which asks for a solution to be found at least for responsible farms and responsible businesses that are in the process of transforming their farms and will have completed that transformation by January 2012. We need to support them in transforming their facilities and give them time to complete that process, thus preventing farms from suffering irreparable damage and preventing an overnight shortage in the EU market, which will consequently increase prices for consumers. We need to respect the directive, give the egg and egg products industries a chance and also respect the right to animal welfare and the right of consumers to a reasonable price.

Commissioner, thank you very much for being here and for having shown so much sensitivity regarding this very important parliamentary initiative that is so necessary for the European livestock sector. The sector is particularly vulnerable to the crises affecting EU agriculture as a whole, due to multiple factors: the high costs of inputs, the fall in market prices, imbalances of power in the food chain and the current increase in cereal prices. The European livestock industry has to deal with these problems just like other agricultural sectors, but with an aggravating factor: the large investments that are particular to this type of production. As the European Commission is on the verge of presenting its communication on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), I think this is a very good time to send a message of solidarity and concern to this group of producers. In my country, Spain, as in other EU countries, we are talking about a structural crisis, and the cereal price rises have just aggravated a situation that has been dragging on for several years now. The statistics show that a growing number of farms are being abandoned. However, this should not be the case in the context of global demand that will grow in the next few years thanks to the supposed improvement in people’s standard of living. With a view to the forthcoming CAP reform, what measures is the Commissioner, or the European Commission, planning, taking into account the specific nature of the livestock sector? I am talking about market measures, and other initiatives to prevent the models of intensive production that respect EU environmental standards being penalised by the future aid system, among other detrimental effects. Common-sense measures should be implemented that guarantee greater security of supply of livestock feed, the establishment of sufficient cereal reserves and the speeding up of the release of those reserves. Finally, to conclude, I would like to welcome the fact that this motion for a resolution makes special mention of pork and poultry, sectors that do not receive direct EU aid, but for which market and trade measures could also be established to alleviate their situation.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Cioloş that this report is essential and comes at the right time because it has demonstrated the abuses committed by mass distribution, severely disrupting the various links in the food chain. While the Bové report may go too far on some points by seeking to be too interventionist, it must be acknowledged that from the point of view of the social market economy that we advocate in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), it provides responses to the justified complaints made by European producers. It also brings transparency to the different parts of the food chain, which is always a good thing, offers the weakest sectors in the chain much more opportunities to defend themselves and, of course, supports European consumers in becoming more informed about that food chain. The European food industry could perhaps have been taken into account to a greater extent in this report, which would have been a good thing, but the report does also include measures for curbing the volatility of prices, which was very necessary. It also sets out measures for achieving equality between the links in the chain, as requested by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and it also asks for abusive and unfair practices in mass distribution to be combated. The time is now coming to establish a list of abusive practices to be strictly banned by European legislation. It is also important that measures be set out for preventing difficult practices through private labels that go against competition and intellectual property law. For all these reasons, we should support the Bové report, and all our fellow Members in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, who have worked hard to ensure that this report was finally published to help European producers move forwards.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the next few months we will be entering into a full debate on the new common agricultural policy (CAP). It is important to reach a satisfactory agreement, and so I hope that the Belgian Presidency manages to achieve what the Spanish Presidency did not. I hope that the Belgian Presidency can direct discussions in such a way that the Member States commit themselves to maintaining a truly strong CAP in the future, with a sufficient budget for meeting the needs of the 27 Member States, both new and old; I also hope that it will not be as it was in 2005, when there was a lack of money and a modulation had to be improvised. In the upcoming reform of the CAP, we are gambling with the viability of a sector that not only provides intangible goods and services, such as care for the environment, but must also guarantee the supply of food to the European public. We have witnessed distressing shortage situations in the past, which is why the European Parliament should make security of supply based on EU production the main objective of the next reform, without leaving aside other contributions, such as the fight against climate change. Esther Herranz García,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

 Madam President, to be honest, the first thing I wanted to do this evening is to thank Mr Scottà for his excellent skill in negotiating this report. It has been a real pleasure working with him and with the other spokespeople for the parliamentary groups. We are proud of the position that will be demonstrated tomorrow in the vote in Parliament and on a report such as this, which defends quality and which commits to the development and enhancement of rural areas, not only as mere evidence of a traditional European culture, but as true wealth- and job-creation agents. These are jobs that we currently need so much at this time of economic crisis and such a dramatic situation in terms of levels of employment in some Member States. In addition, we are pleased with the protection maintained by Parliament and the position already maintained by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as it has made clear, in committing to quality of the highest standard. With regard to that highest standard, moreover, we naturally commit to maintaining that differentiation between Protected Designation of Origin and Protected Geographical Indication. Of course, we reject ideas of levelling quality downwards and we want EU production to receive attention and be valued. I am delighted at what Mr Cioloş had to say. It was, of course, pleasing to hear him speak about commitment to the future of the European farming environment. We naturally hope he will listen to Parliament’s voice, which will be reflected tomorrow in the vote. Finally, I would like to say let us hope that it never happens again that the European Commission gets ahead of Parliament by prohibiting things such as, for example, marketing standards for fruit and vegetables, that have caused such damage to European free competition. We want the imbalances in the market corrected and we also want to commit to quality, variety, food safety and the right quantity of production. In addition, we want EU production and the quality of that EU agricultural and food production to be defended in the World Trade Organisation. We are, of course, also relying on the work of Mr Cioloş for that, because neither our European producers nor our European consumers can go on being defenceless. Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs McGuinness on this initiative, which demonstrates the important role that the common agricultural policy (CAP) plays in meeting food provision needs internationally. Now that the European Commission seems to want to reduce the burden of the CAP on the Community budget, it is important to stress that while the CAP may not be a priority, food sufficiency must be. In past decades, it has been clear that without the CAP, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve food sufficiency. Agriculture cannot, therefore, be compared with other sectors of the economy which are able to thrive in a free market, because the food market is not a free market. Farmers need the support of the European Union in order for their businesses to succeed, and the European Union, in turn, needs farmers in order to maintain an agricultural model that is capable of providing sufficient food of sufficient quality to its increasingly demanding citizens. I therefore believe that we must change the course of the CAP, but not abolish it. In order to do this, direct aid must be guaranteed to farmers and a policy of managing agricultural markets must be restored to bring about greater price stability, which would benefit not only farmers but also consumers and third countries. A framework of best practices should be established in order to encourage balanced relations between the different players in the food chain, avoiding abusive practices and promoting fairer distribution of commercial margins. In addition, a European consumer information policy that highlights efforts by Community producers to comply with European Union regulations in the areas of the environment, food security and animal welfare is needed, since Community producers have to compete with imports from third countries, where the standards applied are much lower. Third-country producers prefer to export to the European Union rather than supplying their own countries’ markets because such exports are more profitable under World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements. Esther Herranz García,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (ES)
 Madam President, the European Union imposes on Community producers the highest standards in the world in terms of food security, health, animal welfare and the environment. European stockbreeders are obliged to meet these standards as a prerequisite for receiving European Union support. For the vast majority, this support does not offset the increased burden, and farms are being abandoned at an alarming rate. This process will continue unless adequate measures are taken. Let us, however, examine the issue more closely. The growing deficit in European production is naturally being covered by imports from third countries, mainly from Brazil. Given the pressure on Community stockbreeders, it would be totally dishonest to allow consignments of meat to enter the Community market if they failed to meet the minimum requirements agreed by the European Union with third countries. I would also like to highlight the fact that these requirements are lower that those imposed on our own farmers, because it would seem that imposing exactly the same standards on third-country imports would go against World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Given that the WTO prevents us from imposing the same standards on imports as we do on European stockbreeders, however, the Commission must, at the very least, guarantee that all meat that crosses Community borders comes from farms that have undergone adequate inspections. It would make no sense to block imports from countries like Brazil, since there is a Community demand which must be met. Nonetheless, this does not justify closing our eyes and looking the other way in the face of any irregularities that the European Union’s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) might detect during its regular inspections. I would like to know why the Commission is so keen to downplay these irregularities given that the FVO, on its last mission to Brazil, confirmed that some certification authorities do not meet the necessary inspection standards. The FVO also found huge flaws in the traceability system used by Brazil and detected problems with many consignments in transit to the European Union that did not have the necessary certificates. In view of this information, how can it be guaranteed that the 1 500 Brazilian farms do fulfil the agreed requirements? Esther Herranz García  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, you ended your speech by saying that there is a crisis in the milk sector, and yet you started by saying that all possible measures have already been taken and that the situation is being sorted out. You should know that it takes a wise woman to recognise that she was wrong. That is a saying in Spain, which could very well be applied to this situation. For months the milk sector has been suffering one of the worst crises in its history. Despite that, because the European Commission and certain governments – seemingly including my own, the Spanish Government – do not want to allow their arms to be twisted, they are refusing to go back on the decisions relating to the health check of the common agricultural policy. Those decisions were taken without any thought for the fragility of this sector, and in a market context very different from the one that has developed since that compromise was agreed. It makes you think that the Member States did not want to see, or could not see, at that time, the storm that was approaching. The reform has very quickly become irrelevant, due to the major turnaround in the market, which demonstrates that the sector is totally at the mercy of price volatility. The fact that major producers such as France and Germany – countries which, in absolute terms, obtained the biggest increase in their national production quotas in this agreement – are now the ones asking for a review of the health check decisions raises a lot of issues. As I see it, the Member States were wrong and should have listened more carefully to the voices, including mine, which were calling for any final decision on the future of the sector to be postponed until 2011. It is a shame that no one listened to us. Perhaps you should do so now. Eva Ortiz Vilella  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the President of the Court of Auditors for his presentation and the Commissioner for his statement.  The figures show that a number of issues need to be examined and we all – Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control, the President of the Court of Auditors and the Commission – need to attend very carefully to our own areas of responsibility, to ensure that we always achieve the best possible results.  Furthermore, the Member States have a very important role to play and must take on a task that, in my opinion, is vital if we are to succeed in ensuring that the results achieved and the image we convey when allocating funds are as good as they can possibly be. It is all the more important that money is spent soundly since that is why we are all here. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, in the last decade, one of the Union’s greatest successes has undoubtedly been the enlargement process. There is a series of principles that must govern, or must continue to govern, that process. I am referring to consolidation, conditionality and communication with the citizens. Another important prerequisite is the EU’s integration capacity. Does this principle still apply, as Ms Koppa’s report rightly suggests? Will we have resources in the future to finance the common policies or cohesion? I ask this because far-reaching cuts are being proposed for the new financial perspective, precisely in the funds for those policies, and others, too. Is that the European Union that we want in the future? Is that the way to prepare for future enlargements? Paradoxically, sometimes the greatest defenders of enlargement are those who most want to reduce the EU budget. We are also seeing the difficulty of having 27 Member States when taking decisions to tackle the serious crisis and strengthen the economic and monetary union. Sometimes, it takes a great deal of time to apply political decisions and that does not set a good example for future enlargements. It is possible that some of our own citizens cannot understand either how the European Union, with so many difficulties, will be able to cope with new enlargement challenges. I would add a small point: I am very pleased that the Koppa report incorporates the idea of creating a specific curricular element on the Union in secondary schools. It is the best way for young generations to find out about the Union and learn more about the enlargement process. My last point is that I cannot support the removal of the footnote from paragraph 28; it is the same formulation as that used by the Council and the Commission. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, given that foreign and security policy is such a broad subject, I shall focus on three basic ideas. Firstly, the EU’s external action should be ambitious. I want the European Union to be a major player in a global, complex, increasingly multipolar world, and it is also possible that we shall soon see something of a withdrawal in the external action of the United States. Secondly, size counts in foreign policy; as Europeans, we are stronger together than apart, and this ambitious perspective for Europe is reflected in Mr Brok’s solid report, which we shall adopt tomorrow. Thirdly, the Treaty of Lisbon provided new tools for this policy. I am referring to the position you hold, Baroness Ashton, as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and Vice-President of the Commission. As you also chair the Foreign Affairs Council, it will now be easier to achieve unity, continuity and consistency in the Union’s foreign policy. In addition, you have a new instrument, the European External Action Service, into which diplomats from Member States have been incorporated, who will use their experience in foreign policy to enrich a vision that is more focused on issues related to economics, trade and cooperation by officials from the Commission. Finally, a true EU foreign policy not only takes time but also needs two basic conditions to be met: the new bodies of the Treaty of Lisbon should be ambitious, working with the purpose of leading the 27 Member States, not just accompanying them or finding lowest common denominators; secondly, the Member States should be aware of the need to work together on foreign policy, acting in a spirit of compromise and taking a constructive approach. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, I welcome the fact that the recent presidential elections in Egypt took place without any major problems and that the results have been accepted, but I think it is clear that those elections and the unexpected decisions taken by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces a few days before demonstrate that, in reality, there is a dual power structure in Egypt. These are delicate times. I believe it is essential that these two centres of power have dialogue and cooperate during this phase and launch an ordered transition towards normal democracy. I welcome the fact that it appears that the government soon to be elected by President Morsi will be a broad government representing broad sectors of the plural society that Egypt has. It will also be important to draw up a new constitution. I trust that it will establish a multi-party democratic system that respects human rights, including the rights of minorities. We cannot forget, as other speakers have said, the importance of the Christian minority, whose rights must be fully respected without discrimination. Egypt, ladies and gentlemen, is a key country in the Arab world and the whole region. What happens there will have repercussions on the rest of the Muslim world. Egypt can set an example, as Mr Pöttering said. It is also very important for the Egyptian political leaders to be aware of the need for their decisions not to destabilise the region, which has suffered numerous conflicts. I welcome the fact that the current international commitments are going to be honoured. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union cannot be removed from what is happening in Egypt. I repeat, it is a very important country, in our Mediterranean neighbourhood. We must support this transition and try to help where we can, without, of course, failing to defend our values and interests. Finally, I would like to express my support for the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which has been suffering a difficult situation in Egypt for months. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).

 Mr President, this is a time of significant change in the Middle East. I will briefly discuss three points: Changes are afoot in Egypt with the forthcoming presidential elections. I would like them to be clean, to take place without incident, and for the parties and society to accept the results. I would certainly have liked the Egyptian authorities to have invited European observers. Egypt is a key country in the Arab world. It is important for a multi-party system to be consolidated there in which the prosperity and freedoms of the Egyptian people are the main objective. Living together in tolerance, rather than radicalism or polarisation, will allow all Egyptians to exercise freedoms, including religious freedom. What are your hopes, Baroness Ashton, for these elections? In Israel, I would like the broader base of the new government to favour the opening of negotiations with the Palestinians, but I am sceptical about the launching of negotiations this year due to the continuing problem of the settlements, which you referred to along with the regional and international context, including the electoral outlook in the United States. Another reason I am sceptical is the way that Israel is focusing on the Iranian nuclear programme. However, I do not think that the deadlock is helping anyone. I do not think that the changes that have taken place in the region are going to provide Israel with a more favourable context in future for resuming the negotiations. I will end by discussing Syria. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, things are not improving there, as has already been stated. Kofi Annan’s plan is not succeeding. The violence is only increasing, and is even seriously affecting children, and Kofi Annan’s plan is not supporting the opposition. I am afraid that President al-Assad’s government thinks that it can crush the revolution by force, and that in the end, the international community will accept it. It is essential that Russia and China place more pressure on the Syrian authorities to change their attitude. I would like you to tell us, Baroness Ashton, whether, at the recent summit with Russia at the weekend, you were able to glean whether there is any desire in Moscow to adjust its position. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).

 Mr President, the consolidation of democracy, human rights and the rule of law is particularly important in our neighbourhood – taken from Article 8 of the Treaty on European Union – and Ukraine is a neighbouring country to Europe, with which we have concluded negotiations on an association agreement, and one which has what we call ‘European prospects’. For that reason, therefore, there needs to be a strong demand for human rights. I am worried about the lack of political will from the Ukrainian authorities on this matter. This is emphasised with the case of Ms Yulia Tymoshenko and also other opposition leaders, victims of selective justice and a penal code from the Soviet era, as previously mentioned. It appears that their ambiguity means that there is almost no difference between political and penal responsibility. A democratic system cannot function in this manner. Fundamental rights need to be protected, and opposition politics logically have to be respected. In addition, I think it would be very convenient if the European Union could reach a unanimous view on the level and manner in which high-ranking politicians are going to attend the European Football Championships that are to be played in Ukraine next month. And, lastly, ladies and gentlemen, I was somewhat surprised to read that the President of this House entertained the Prime Minister of Ukraine last week. Given that neither the Council nor the Commission went to such lengths, I wonder whether our coordination within the institutions of the Union is appropriate, and I would like Mr Füle, the Commissioner, to tell me if this coordination exists. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, first of all, Baroness Ashton, I would like to thank you for what you said about the arbitrary and unlawful expropriation that the Repsol company in Argentina is undergoing. This measure goes against international law and the principle of legal certainty that affects all Europeans. I welcome your response and, once again, I thank you for your words, Baroness Ashton. I would now like to talk about the Howitt report. Articles 3 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union show very clearly that human rights are an extremely important part of the EU’s external relations. That is because the rule of law and human rights are a constituent part, so to speak, of this Union and its Member States, but also because in today’s world, the international community as a whole considers that human rights are universal and indivisible, and that defending them can no longer be hindered by the old principle of non-interference in Member States’ internal affairs. The report we shall vote on tomorrow shows how important human rights are for Parliament; this can be clearly seen, I believe, from the Sakharov Prize that we created in this House many years ago, and also from the support we are giving to the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. Ladies and gentlemen, respect for human rights is a highly topical issue. This can be seen from the brand new role being created, which will be responsible for protecting human rights, and from the changes and revolutions that broke out last year in the Arab world – one of the main goals of which was to recover human dignity and respect for human rights. Baroness Ashton, we must all do our utmost – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – so that those political processes can consolidate the noble aspirations for which they were initiated, and so that the expectation of freedom, pluralism, tolerance and respect for minorities is not jeopardised.

 On behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we want to declare that our vote on the resolution on the European integration process of Kosovo is based on the fact that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it was a normal independent state, recognised by the international community, and does not take into account that the status of this territory continues to be controversial. It has yet to be recognised by a majority of countries, five of which are Member States of the European Union, including Spain. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Madam President, I would like to focus on three points regarding Turkey’s accession to the European Union. The first of these is its visa policy for third country nationals. Speaking two years ago in Parliament, I expressed my surprise that Turkey did not bring this policy into line with that of the European Union. According to the European Commission’s 2011 Progress Report, Turkey has recently signed visa waiver agreements with Sudan and Yemen. I have also been informed that Iranian, Libyan, Lebanese and Syrian nationals do not require visas either. Last week, a very widely read Spanish newspaper claimed that Turkey’s visa exemption for some countries, together with its land border, which runs for thousands of kilometres, make the country a corridor of choice for organised crime. In my opinion, Turkey should make a serious effort and progressively bring itself into line with the Union’s visa policy. It is part of the acquis. It should align itself with Europe rather than continuing on its current line, which takes it in the opposite direction, distancing it from European Union policy. It should progressively align itself, and I believe that the Commission should carefully monitor this matter. Secondly, I think political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey should be closer. Turkey has recently become close to the Arab world. It occupies a very significant position in a region that is very close and very important to Europe, and which is undergoing major changes. Dialogue and cooperation between Brussels and Ankara would be very positive. Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the range of reforms that Turkey has introduced, and I hope it pursues them with determination and strength, as the report that we will approve tomorrow calls on it to do. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, talking of enlargement encourages optimism. No Member State wishes to leave the Union; on the contrary, there are a number of states who wish to join, Iceland among them. I welcome its desire for integration and the rapid pace of adhesion negotiations. I say adhesion because that is what it is, adhering to and accepting the European Union acquis
. In the negotiations, efforts are continuing to define the adaptations that the candidate country needs to make to adopt the acquis
 and the timescale for this. In the Commission’s report of October 2011, we were told that as yet, there had been no changes to Icelandic legislation on fisheries, and that it is not in line with the EU acquis
, nor are the current restrictions on foreign investment in fisheries consistent with the acquis
: they infringe fundamental principles, like the right of establishment and the free movement of capital and services. Iceland is a major fishing nation, like my own country, Spain and my region, the Autonomous Community of Galicia. Iceland’s accession will strengthen the fisheries sector within the Union, but, Mr President, it cannot remain outside EU law in this sector. I am asking the Commission to pay the closest attention to this issue. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). -  
(ES)
 Mr President, Russia is very important to the European Union both as a neighbouring European country and as a global actor and permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. This is why we would like to have a closer relationship with Russia so that we can address issues of mutual interest and for reasons of global governance. However, there are obstacles to such a close relationship. We regret Russia’s behaviour during the Syrian crisis, and certain recent events, like December’s elections to the Duma, and the presidential elections on 4 March, have left us feeling disappointed and concerned. The elections did not conform to the democratic standards of a European country which is a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE. As I have said, it is in our interests to have a relationship of mutual trust with Russia, but the fundamental basis of this relationship should be shared democratic values, joint respect for human rights, the multi-party system and respect for the democratic opposition. The modern Russia we want to see is a Russia which shares European values. We can build the close relationship we want on the basis of these values. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Russia is an important neighbour for the EU, for both geographical and historical reasons, and it is also a very significant economic and energy partner. Furthermore, it is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Russia is one of the actors needed for efficient global governance capable of dealing with global problems, and we also need increased cooperation from Russia on issues such as the situation in Syria, which is on the brink of civil war, or the nuclear threat from Iran. I believe, however, that the EU wants a relationship with Russia that goes beyond those global or regional interests. Russia is a European neighbour, and a member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. I believe that we would like a relationship of real trust and friendship with Russia, based on shared values and principles. That is why we want a new association agreement and why we want for Russia what we also demand of ourselves: a pluralistic democratic regime that respects civil and political freedoms, and a rule of law in which corruption and arbitrariness are the exception. However, the organisation of the legislative elections in December did nothing to strengthen that trust. The irregularities of the election process are well known, as are the serious accusations made. I hope that the next presidential elections will not show the same shortcomings, and that Russia can finally start to move towards clear democratic progress and modernity, which is what its European partners wish for.

 Madam President, our ‘southern’ neighbourhood is going through a new phase in its history, from which there is no way back. The European Union must support these processes of democratic change, drastically altering its former complacency, which gave the impression of aiming for stability but was nothing more than inertia. As Article 8 of the Treaty of Lisbon states, our neighbourhood policy should be based on universal values such as human dignity, human rights, democracy and the rule of law, as well as having conditions and specific requirements, since not all processes are the same. There should be country-specific procedures in each case. In any event, we must embark upon dialogue with new political groups, including moderate Islamist forces, based on the values mentioned previously. We should strengthen our relations with these countries, their political and social forces and their civil societies. This is a job for the EU institutions and also for European political and social groups. Aside from the political support, we must provide economic and financial aid to these countries. Commercial opening should be gradual. It should be mutually beneficial and include the services sector, as called for by the report. We should also prioritise the administrative and institutional development of several of our neighbours to the south and help them in the fight against corruption and organised crime. I would also like to see the Union for the Mediterranean find sufficient resources to put some of the identified projects into action. These issues and many more, Madam President – and I am finishing now – are covered in the extensive report written by my brilliant colleague, Mário David, which we will be voting on tomorrow. I am sure, Mr Füle, that you and the Commission services will find it a very useful read. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, Europe and the United States are going through a severe economic crisis. Both our economies are very interconnected and during the next summit, we have to commit to act in a more coordinated manner and to implement the commitments that were made at the G20. In a globalised economy, the solutions should be global, but it is also necessary for everyone to fulfil their responsibilities in their own area. The United States should reduce its trade and fiscal deficits and China should revaluate its currency. We Europeans should finally solve the Greek crisis and the sovereign debt issues in several of our countries. Otherwise, we would not have any credibility as effective partners. The fleeting presence of President Obama in Europe to attend the G20 meeting in Cannes contrasts with the time he is dedicating to the Asia-Pacific region this week. It appears to symbolise the rise of Asia and the decline of Europe. It is not only economic challenges that we Europeans and Americans have to tackle, however, but also many others: climate change, nuclear proliferation, energy, terrorism, poverty; and regional issues such as the Arab Spring and the conflict in the Middle East. We should consult and coordinate and stop the concept of the ‘West’ or the ‘transatlantic community’ increasingly losing value to Asia’s benefit. Asia should also take part in global governance, but not by taking the role of Europe. For that we need a true Europe, a solid European Union, an efficient global player, and not a fragile set of countries that do not know how to resolve the sovereign debt crisis. This is what the United States expects and is also what our citizens want. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, religious freedom is recognised in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and also in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Egypt has been a State Party since 1982. Moreover, we know how important freedom of demonstration and expression is. The seriousness of what happened on 9 October 2011 in Cairo lies in the fact that disproportionate force was used against demonstrators who were part of a minority demanding protection for their religious freedom. There needs to be a rigorous investigation into what took place, and the guilty parties should be punished, as Mr Pöttering quite rightly said. Ms Ashton, religious freedom must be protected, and all countries must respect it, as this Parliament called for in its resolution of 20 January 2011. We want an Egypt of freedom, justice and peace; an Egypt that keeps its distance from events such as these. What is more, Egypt is a great country and a leader in the Arab world: what goes on there has major repercussions. Recent events cannot happen again. Egypt should be an example of tolerance and harmony, not one of violence and violated freedoms. The EU should do its utmost to see that freedoms are respected during the transitions taking place in the Arab world, which we wish to promote and accompany. In recent months, Christian leaders and representatives of civil society expressed their concern to me over the situation regarding religious freedom in their particular countries. Baroness Ashton, I would like you to keep us informed of the measures you intend to propose in order to strengthen the action taken by the EU in this area, as the Foreign Affairs Council asked you to do in February.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we debated the peace process here over six months ago. I stressed at that time that there was an urgent need to re-start talks because time was not in favour of either of the two parties. I can understand how the stalling of the process has prompted the Palestinians to take the initiative and to raise the issue of their admission to the United Nations. We are now in a very complex situation. I suppose that this matter will eventually be passed from the Security Council to the General Assembly. I would like the European Union and its Member States to play an active role and for the Twenty-Seven to be united in stating an opinion on the resolution that will eventually be put to the vote. There are no simple solutions: no simple yes and no simple no. The General Assembly’s resolution must be careful. It must not imperil the peace process or put either of the two sides, or the other players who are the main promoters of the process, into impossible situations. However, a failure to act must not be an option. Ladies and gentlemen, today, unfortunately, just like six months ago, I cannot be optimistic about the progress of the talks. The news we have received today about new settlements in Jerusalem is, frankly, very bad. In addition, I fear that some of the 2012 elections will not help lead to a solution. The situation could be better in 2013, but I would be sorry to have lost a year, particularly given the current dynamics of change in the Arab world. These are times of historic responsibility for the two sides, and also for the international community. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, Lady Ashton, I share your view that the EU must give its attention as a matter of priority to the southern Mediterranean, which is going through a period of extraordinary changes. I am delighted that the recent referendum in Morocco has adopted the reform promoted by King Mohammed VI. It would be good if changes at a constitutional level were accompanied by reforms in economic and social matters in order to reduce inequalities. Contrary to what is happening in Morocco, we are receiving bad news from Syria and, unfortunately, the end of the Gaddafi regime has not yet been brought about in Libya. We must remain involved in these processes, and also in Egypt and Tunisia. It is very important that we go along with the changes that are taking place in the region and we must ensure that the values of liberty, justice, democracy and respect for human rights, including freedom of conscience and religion and also gender equality, prevail. Positive conditionality or, what amounts to the same thing, the more for more strategy, should assist this as well as strengthen relations with civil society. Ladies and gentlemen, I am concluding. I hope, moreover, that the Union for the Mediterranean is finally able to act after a period of paralysis. Furthermore, as of yesterday, it has a new Secretary General, whom I wish success in the complex management of the Union. Let us hope that projects identified some three years ago can be set in motion and so contribute to improving the economy in the Mediterranean countries. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, I, too, of course, would like to add my support for the residents of Lorca. In this debate about education, I want to reiterate an important point: the need to include in secondary school studies a specific subject covering the history, aims and workings of the European Union. I have already talked about this issue in the last term, in plenary, after the failure of Constitutional Treaty referenda. Fortunately, last year in this House, the Løkkegaard report on journalism and new media, approved in September, supported the introduction of this subject in paragraph 13. I myself submitted an amendment in this regard. Recently in Spain, the Valencia regional government decided to include a subject for the next academic year. It is an initiative that other regions and countries should follow. I understand that the Commission, of course, supports and welcomes initiatives of this type.

Mr President, I would like to start with two initial observations. I prefer individual debates to a joint debate. We are dealing with separate issues, which deserve independent and in-depth discussion. Meanwhile, I would like to echo the words of Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra about the death of the Cuban dissident, Mr Soto. Please allow me to make three additional comments. Unfortunately, when all of us were hoping we could focus on the European Union’s external role these years, the serious economic and financial crisis has been taking up all our efforts. However, a great number of external challenges, particularly in our Mediterranean neighbourhood, mean we cannot afford to wait. The European Union must have a political and economic presence in the processes of change taking place in the Arab world. I am also celebrating, Baroness Ashton, the fact that the European Union’s voice in the United Nations General Assembly was finally strengthened in New York last week as the result of a vote that received widespread support. I congratulate you on that, given that last year’s disaster raised worrying questions about the future role of the Union in the world and in international organisations. However, the divergent European votes on Resolution 1973 of the United Nations Security Council highlight the enormous difficulties – I stress, enormous difficulties – involved in achieving an effective common security and defence policy. To summarise, Baroness Ashton, you and Mr Van Rompuy, who also has many responsibilities in foreign matters, have the huge task of convincing the Member States of the need for unified and coherent external action. The two of you will have to work hard to push, drag and lead, at a moment in history that we had intended to tackle with the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I regret the Council’s absence in today’s debate. With regard to the Southern Neighbourhood, I shall make three points. Firstly, the European Union must support and facilitate the processes of democratic change. In the past, neighbouring authorities used their concerns over stability as a way of justifying their inaction. Secondly, I wish for economic prosperity for our southern neighbours; this requires a great deal of reforms, investments, and financial and economic aid, as well as trade, not just with the North, but also South-South trade, which is currently non-existent. I am concerned about the line being taken by the Commission and the High Representative, Mrs Ashton: in an article published in The New York Times on 18 March 2011, she appears to be advising those countries to specialise in agricultural exports to European markets. I disagree. Commissioner Füle is well aware of this, although he seems to be shaking his head. These countries need diversified economies and agriculture. I repeat: diversified. They also need to attend to their domestic food needs and not restrict themselves to a few export products which, in addition, cause concern for European farmers. We therefore need common sense and prudence on this issue. Thirdly, we need to revitalise the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and its projects, which can help in the economic modernisation of the Mediterranean countries. Unfortunately, the UfM is still in deadlock, there is no General Secretary, and it cannot continue to be hijacked by the lack of progress between Israel and Palestine. Ladies and gentlemen, we are facing a major challenge. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).

 Mr President, as indicated in the Middle East Quartet Statement made in Munich, we would all like to see the end of negotiations between Israel and Palestine in September 2011 in the form of an agreed solution for the two states that will bring peace and security. Unfortunately, the prospects are not rosy. With only six months left, negotiations have come to a standstill, stalled over the question of the settlements. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that the loss of valuable time will benefit Israel, nor will it contribute to finding a successful solution. On the one hand, I am concerned that it will become ever harder to find moderate leaders in Palestine with enough political support to be able to conclude agreements with Israel, which is no easy task. On the other hand, if the settlements remain, it will become ever harder to create a truly viable Palestine state. Lady Ashton, I agree that the peace process should not be put on hold because of political upheaval in the region. If the current events result in democratic regimes, as we all hope, regimes that will listen to the wishes of the people, the climate in the region will become even less propitious for Israel. It may be that Israel will become even more isolated and come under greater pressure from some of its Arab neighbours. In conclusion, everyone, including Israel, would benefit from reaching a solution as soon as possible. I would therefore urge the European Union to contribute actively to restarting the peace process in close cooperation with the United States and the other Quartet members. Lady Ashton, I hope that there will be a high-level Quartet meeting this month, as set out in the Munich Statement. Can you confirm whether that will be the case? Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, I am very pleased that the Commission is preparing a communication on the European strategy for the Atlantic region. This is a region that has two major, related characteristics: its oceanic-maritime nature and its peripheral character. I will make four points. Firstly, I would stress the importance of its maritime aspect, because of which, the strategy must attach importance to the preservation of the marine environment, fishing, the environment, energies related to this marine environment, and tourism. Secondly, given the peripheral nature of the region, transport – so-called ‘connectivity’ – is very important, both between the areas that make up the Atlantic region and, above all, with the rest of the European Union. The trans-European transport networks, the highways of the sea and energy connections must be given priority. With regard to Galicia, my constituency, I also have in mind the high-speed connection with the north of Portugal and the Transcantábrico train. Thirdly, Commissioner, I believe that the strategy must not focus solely on maritime issues. It must, as Mr Cadec has said, have a significant land-based dimension which includes the objectives of social, economic and territorial cohesion. As the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow indicates, the strategy for the Atlantic region must be closely connected with the Europe 2020 strategy, and with regional development policy and future economic prospects. Finally, the various administrations and organisations that exist in the Atlantic region must be taken closely into account, including the regional government of Galicia and the Euroregion created with the neighbouring community of North Portugal, which were amongst the first in the European Union to create a European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation. All of this means that there is a need for the Commission to maintain a permanent dialogue with these regions and entities, during both the development of the strategy and its subsequent implementation.

Mr President, we need further clarification on the Supreme Military Council’s plans in Egypt. One specific undertaking is the holding of democratic elections within six months, following a constitutional reform led by experts. However, I have also read that next week we will see a new government supposedly including opposition representatives, according to the British Foreign Secretary. I think we all agree, in any case, that the best way forward is to have a transitional process, supported by the widest possible political consensus, until the elections are held. It would also be desirable for the social forces to work together to ensure that this transition is unburdened by major tensions. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union must support the democratic process and contribute to its success. Egypt is a key country, and developments there will be felt throughout the Mediterranean and the Arab world. I therefore welcome Baroness Ashton’s visit to Cairo next week. One further point: The Tunisians and the Egyptians have given us a lesson in the people’s desire for freedom. I hope the foreign ministers will not overlook this lesson when they come to assess the common position on Cuba, which is precisely aimed at attaining a democratic transition in that country, and which defends those who defend freedom. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).

 Madam President, the events taking place in Tunisia and Egypt are very significant and it is possible that these processes of change will spread to other countries in the Mediterranean region, which is a region of the highest importance to the European Union. These countries are right on our doorstep and we have numerous strong ties of friendship with them. In the last decade, the European Union has been unable to persuade their authorities to undertake the necessary reforms. In the last parliamentary term I myself stressed that stability could not continue to be used to justify a lack of change, but rather that these countries needed profound political, economic and social reforms. Now change and reform are being demanded by the people on the streets. Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that the Council finally paid attention to these events on Monday and has taken a position. I too have the impression that the transition process in Tunisia is headed in the right direction. However, the wider perception is, unfortunately, that the European Union has been almost absent from these processes in recent weeks. We have heard several speeches by President Obama, we have heard statements from Secretary of State Clinton, and we have even heard about contact between the Tunisian Army and representatives of the US Army… The Union’s visibility has been in no way comparable. The Treaty of Lisbon’s new mechanisms should have been more active and visible, including the President of the European Council. Baroness Ashton, I welcome your trip to Tunisia in two weeks’ time, but I also believe that we must improve our capacities for prediction and reaction. Do we want to be a major global player? We need to start with being relevant at regional level, as a minimum. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
).

Mr President, this debate is very necessary given the recent serious events that are affecting the religious freedom and even the lives of Christians. I am particularly referring to what has happened mainly in Pakistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Egypt. Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights sets out in great detail what it calls freedom of religion or religious freedom. Despite this, it is, unfortunately, a right that is little respected in some countries. We are now even seeing that those who profess the Christian faith can pay for it with their lives. Baroness Ashton, the European Union must robustly defend the right to religious freedom in general, clearly incorporating it into its external action and demanding respect, freedom and security for what is now the most persecuted religious group in the world, the Christian community. We must demand that all the governments concerned do what is necessary to prevent these attacks, and when that is not possible, to arrest and punish those responsible. Ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, freedom is a symbol of European identity, and that includes religious freedom, which is part of the basic core of human rights. That freedom is also a path to peace, as Pope Benedict XVI said in his message on 1 January. I would also like to highlight the essential role of Christianity in shaping the European identity. It would therefore be a sad paradox if the European Union did not demand as firmly as possible that the world protect the most basic rights of Christians and did not help them where it could. The European Parliament resolution sets out methods for better defending religious freedom in general and the freedom of Christians in particular. I welcome the fact that the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council is to give them close consideration, and – I am finishing now, Mr President – that the forthcoming European Council on 14 February is to give its opinion on these serious events, just as, for example, President Sarkozy very courageously did. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, this debate on Libya is taking place at a time when very significant changes are happening in another neighbouring Mediterranean country: Tunisia. I have always believed that the European Union must help to promote serious reforms in the Mediterranean region, with the aim of making it an area of freedom and prosperity. I refer to my speeches in this House in recent years, in which I have repeatedly said that the Union’s policy cannot be focused on simply maintaining the status quo
. This is not, however, the specific issue being debated today, which is the Framework Agreement with Libya. I would like to stress the need to cooperate with Libya in managing migratory flows, including an agreement to readmit illegal immigrants including third-country nationals, as is the case in all readmission agreements concluded by the Union. Giving in to Libyan positions that are contrary to this agreement would be detrimental given Libya’s important position as a transit country, and it would also send a very negative message for the negotiations with Morocco and Algeria on readmission agreements, which have been in deadlock for many years. However, we do also have to insist that the Libyan authorities respect the rights of refugees, including – as has already been said – the principle of non-refoulement. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would also like to express my concern regarding the impact of this agreement on the canned tuna fishing sector, which is very important in Spain and particularly in Galicia, my constituency. This negative impact is, as has been said, due to an unprecedented and ill-founded concession: the exemption from the rules of origin for processed fish products, when requested, due to not having sufficient indigenous raw materials. That was the first thing that Papua New Guinea did, and the exemption is being applied. Papua New Guinea is thus becoming a major platform for the processing and export of tuna from the European industry’s major competitors: the Philippines, Thailand, China and the United States. It is really they who are the major beneficiaries of the agreement. It is estimated that this tuna production will ultimately amount to 400 000 tonnes per year, destined for the European market, which currently consumes a total of around 710 000 tonnes. The impact will be very serious, as the prices of the tuna from Papua New Guinea are one third lower than the price of European tuna, due to the country’s low wages and non-existent environmental standards. In my region, Galicia, this is considered to be unbeatable competition, which will have serious consequences for employment. I want the impact assessment announced by the European Commission to be as rigorous as possible and to take into account the short and medium-term consequences of this exemption from the rules of origin. I hope that it will put an end to the application of this exemption as soon as possible. It is an exceptional and temporary measure, but it appears that in Papua New Guinea, they consider it to be a permanent one: otherwise, the investments would not be made. I also hope that this exemption is not included in other agreements or in the final agreement. Currently, however, there is a problem with the provisional agreement, and it must be rectified. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, the Union’s most important strategic relationship is the one it has with the United States. We must maintain a continuous dialogue on bilateral issues and also on global issues, and try to ensure the most coordinated action possible. In my view, this is the main message of tomorrow’s resolution. I therefore regretted the fact that the planned summit in May was not held. Moreover, I found the argument given at the time that there was no agenda to be absurd. There is always an agenda between two partners that are so important and which are immersed in a global economic crisis, and when there are challenges such as terrorism, climate change, energy security or nuclear proliferation. Moreover, there are major regional conflicts, for example, the Middle East peace process, the Iranian nuclear challenge or the issue of Afghanistan, which, in my view, are worthy of coordinated action by the United States and the European Union. I hope that the forthcoming Lisbon summit will be a success. There are many issues to tackle, some of which I have already mentioned. Moreover, the world is changing. Asia is in the ascendancy; let us think about the importance of China or India, which President Obama has just visited. There is even talk of a post-Western world. In this context of a changing world order, we need close coordination between Europe and the United States. We have many interests, ideals and values in common. We will be stronger if we act in a coordinated way. Ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has also created new bodies to strengthen the Union’s role in the world. We should therefore also improve our mechanisms for dialogue and coordination with the United States. The resolution adopted by Parliament in March last year contains many ideas as to how to strengthen those institutional mechanisms for dialogue between Brussels and Washington. My final comment is that I regret the fact that the representative of the Council only referred to an exchange of data; he did not come here to talk about the summit, about which we heard nothing. Unfortunately, the Commission did so only very briefly. Who really came here to talk about the summit? Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I am really delighted that the European Council has discussed the Union’s external action. We are in a new world, which is multipolar from an economic point of view and increasingly from a political point of view, with a smaller number of significant players. Moreover, the challenges that we face are global ones. No country can face them alone, including the countries of the EU. As the President of the Commission said a few days ago, in a global world, size does matter. The European Union must be one of those players. I therefore regret the result of the vote in New York last week on strengthening the EU’s position in the United Nations. What happened is very concerning. I think it would be very good for careful preparations to be made in future for summits with the other major players. As well as tackling the way that the other players voted on 14 September in New York, they are also needed to tackle important bilateral and multilateral issues. Among other things, we need to govern globalisation, adapting the institutions that were established after the Second World War and strengthening more recent forums such as the G20. In doing all these things, I also think that we need to be working in harmony with the United States. We share many values and interests with them, and I trust that sound preparations are being made for the summit on 20 November. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union’s external action will have more continuity and consistency. However, along with the internal strength of the Union, the political will for joint action by the 27 is also essential, particularly among the most significant Member States. This process of uniting will inevitably be a long and difficult one. It is necessary, however, if we want to prevent Europe from being irrelevant and prevent what is beginning to be described as the advent of a post-Western era.

On behalf of the Spanish delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we would like to state that the reasoning behind our vote on the resolution on the process relating to the European integration of Kosovo is that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it were an independent state in an entirely normal situation, without taking into account the fact that the status of this territory continues to be very controversial within the international community – an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice is also pending – and Kosovo has not been recognised by five Member States of the European Union, including Spain. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Madam President, the importance of relations with Russia for the European Union is obvious: it is a powerful neighbour, a strategic economic and energy partner, and a permanent member of the Security Council. Russia now seems to be more peaceful and settled, thanks to the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the United States, overcoming its disagreement with the anti-missile shield and the agreements that it has reached with the new Ukrainian Government. Furthermore, the tension caused two years ago by its intervention in Georgia has decreased. In this new context, we all welcome Russia’s support of the recent Security Council Resolution 1929 on Iran. This is therefore a good time to improve relations with Russia. Consequently, Baroness Ashton, I regret the fact that there has not been any progress in the negotiation of the new partnership agreement with Russia that first requires Russia to join the World Trade Organisation, something that has also still not been clarified. Ladies and gentlemen, there needs to be an ambitious agreement that includes and regulates energy, investment and trade issues. Clear, legally binding rules are what is needed. Also, I do, of course, agree with the European Union supporting and helping Russia in its desire to modernise, but the Partnership for Modernisation, which was the framework for the relationship established at the recent summit, should not be an alternative to the aforementioned agreement. I certainly welcome the fact that the Presidency is including the effective functioning of the judicial system and stepping up the fight against corruption in that partnership. I will conclude now: what I also want is a single, efficient and coherent EU policy, and I hope that the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon – you yourself, High Representative, and the permanent President of the European Council – will help us to achieve this aim of a single, coherent policy. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, a preliminary clarification: in my view, either a representative of the Presidency of the Council, or, perhaps, of the current French co-presidency of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), should have spoken in this debate today; their absence is deeply regrettable. Ladies and gentlemen, it is a priority for the European Union to ensure that its closest neighbours form an area of peace, prosperity, freedom and security. This should be the primary objective of the UfM, which I hope is due to hold its second summit next month. I would like to congratulate Mr Peillon and to express my thanks, most especially, for his open-minded and extremely constructive approach. In spite of the proximity of the European Union to the southern shores of the Mediterranean, there are considerable differences separating us in economic, political, social, demographic and cultural terms, and so on. Some of these disparities are due to serious deficiencies in our neighbouring states. It is crucial to promote close dialogue and cooperation within the framework of the UfM, and to bring forward those major joint projects which it has identified, as well as the bilateral dimension of the association agreements, in order to strengthen the relationship between both shores and to be able to reduce these disparities. In order to achieve this, our neighbours, too, must implement reforms. Standing still cannot be an option. I would like briefly to raise three further points. Firstly, it is very important for the secretariat of the UfM in Barcelona to be fully operational as soon as possible. Secondly, and closely linked to the previous point, the UfM must not fall hostage to conflicts, such as that in the Middle East. The UfM can facilitate a solution but it does not claim to be the means to the solution nor should it be blocked by these confrontations. Thirdly and lastly, the UfM must also pay particular attention to what is known as Chapter Four of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation: migration, security, social integration and justice.

 Mr President, we are all concerned by the increase in violence in Ciudad Juarez, but I trust in the broad measures that the Mexican authorities have put in place in order to effectively tackle this complex situation. I also support the vigorous battle President Calderón is currently waging against drugs trafficking, which is a very serious global threat that concerns us all. That is why we should help the Mexican authorities in this difficult struggle. Ladies and gentlemen, over the past 10 years, Mexico has gone through a very positive process of political and governmental modernisation. President Calderón is steadily promoting reforms. Mexico has also taken on greater international responsibilities and is playing an active role within, for example, the United Nations and the G-20. In this Parliament, within my modest capabilities, I have always supported the establishment of a strategic partnership between the European Union and Mexico, which we finally achieved in 2008. I hope we can adopt an ambitious joint action plan or programme at the May Summit in Madrid, because the European Union and Mexico need to work together in many areas, both on a bilateral level and in multilateral forums, in order to confront challenges and threats together, including drugs trafficking and other forms of organised crime Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, the Union’s foreign policy is entering a new phase, as Baroness Ashton and Mr Albertini have said this morning. Article 21 of the treaty establishes objective principles. New positions are also created by the treaty, with a High Representative, a Vice-President of the Commission, a permanent President of the European Council, a European External Action Service, and a new Security and Defence Policy, which is the subject of the report by my colleague Mr Danjean, etc. These innovations aim to ensure that the European Union has a much more effective influence in the world, and I think that summits with third countries continue to be an ideal instrument for achieving this. The European Union does not hold many summits with individual countries, so we should take care with them. The summit held last week with Morocco was the first summit with an Arab country, and also symbolised advanced status being granted to Morocco. I would have liked you to have attended, Baroness Ashton. I also regret that the King of Morocco was not present. His absence meant that a summit that should have been historic lost political influence, significance and effectiveness. I hope that the Union for the Mediterranean Summit in Barcelona will also be successful in terms of the level of the delegations. I also regret the fact that the summit with President Obama planned for the spring is not going to take place. As the Albertini report states, the Treaty of Lisbon sets the stage for strengthening our mechanisms for dialogue with the United States. This and other subjects could have been dealt with at the summit. The European Union and the United States should not miss the opportunity to deal at a high level with the bilateral matters, conflicts and global challenges that are now mounting up on the world’s agenda. It would be paradoxical – and I will finish now – if now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, we ran the risk of becoming irrelevant in this world that some are now calling ‘post-Western’ or ‘post-American’. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Madam President, democracy and defending human rights have an important place among the Union’s principles and objectives for external action – I refer to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union. This Article also applies to relations with Cuba and with the Cuban people, who are very dear to us. Unfortunately, in the last five years, the Council’s actions appear to have been essentially governed by a desire to correct the line adopted in previous years, especially in 2003 when there was an extremely harsh wave of oppression in Cuba. In 2005, the Council suspended the 2003 measures. Subsequently, there were trips to the island by foreign ministers and commissioners. In June 2008, the 2003 measures were lifted and a global political dialogue was established – as Mr López Garrido reminded us – along with regular high-level meetings. A Head of State of a Member State even recently visited Havana. Unfortunately, the European political leaders who went to the island did not have any time to meet with the representatives of the dissidents, who therefore felt marginalised. Over all this time, repression in Cuba has continued. There have been no changes or reforms. Nevertheless, political dialogue has been maintained. Now we are all shaken up by the cruel death of the political prisoner, Orlando Zapata. As is well known, ladies and gentlemen, some governments, such as the Spanish Government, have repeatedly said that they want to cancel the common position. It says something very logical: support for democratic transition, essentially the same thing that is required by the principles and objectives of Article 21 of the treaty. I will conclude with two points. The common position has not hindered dialogue. This is obvious. What is more, it was reconfirmed recently by the 27 ministers, in June 2009. Secondly, the priority cannot be to change the common position – that would be the last straw! The priority now is to ask for the immediate, complete and unconditional release of all political prisoners. I see Cuba and Latin America as Western, and the symbols that identify the West are the dignity of human beings and respect for their fundamental rights. I have a final thought: I would like to remind the Council that, in its own conclusions in June 2009, it said that the future of political dialogue with the Cuban authorities was dependent on progress being made, in particular, on human rights. Can anyone say that this progress is taking place today? Can anyone really say that? Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, may I welcome the Commissioner. In this decade, enlargement policy has been the European Union’s greatest success, along with the euro. That policy should not be held back. Furthermore, we cannot break the commitments we have made with candidate countries, although we should also respect the well-known principles of consolidation and conditionality. We also should not forget the European Union's integration capacity or the need to communicate with citizens on the subject of enlargement and its advantages and consequences. Given the time restrictions, I shall just make a few brief comments. In principle, candidate countries should resolve beforehand any territorial disputes and similar issues they might have with each other and with Member States, so as not to later slow down the operation of the Union. In the case of Turkey, I would particularly like to highlight how important it is for the rate of reforms – which are also necessary for Turkey itself – to be maintained and even increased. I also welcome the recent commitment Turkey has shown with regard to Nabucco, which is very important for energy diversification in Europe. However, I must admit that I was somewhat surprised by the gesture that the Turkish Government made last autumn in support of the Iranian authorities. Indeed, I believe that a candidate country’s foreign policy should be in line with that of the Union. Finally, last week, I read an interview with the Turkish Minister for European Affairs which seemed to suggest that Turkey had abolished visas for countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Libya. I was somewhat surprised by this because a candidate country should also be bringing its visa policy closer to that of the European Union, not moving in the opposite direction. I would like confirmation of that information. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, I am delighted that the Swedish Presidency has strengthened the European Union’s commitment to stability and development in Afghanistan through the action plan. I would, of course, like to know more about funding for this plan as far as Afghanistan is concerned. Another very important moment for Afghanistan will be the London Conference in January. At that conference, we will hear about the specific pledges made by the European Union and its Member States. We should also hear from the new Afghan Government about the many commitments it must make in areas such as combating corruption and drug trafficking. I am rather alarmed at reports in today’s press of the speech given yesterday by President Karzai on the corruption issue. Ladies and gentlemen, President Obama’s decision to increase his military contingent by 30 000 troops is very recent. In short, Afghanistan is at a crucial stage and the United States and Europe must work in a very coordinated manner. What is at stake in Afghanistan is not only the prosperity and freedom of Afghans, but also the stability of the region, including such an important country as Pakistan. Our own security is also at stake, given the continuing threat posed by al-Qaeda, as has already been said. The credibility of NATO and of what we call the West also depends to a large extent on the results in Afghanistan. We cannot fail. In order to succeed, though, as has also been said, we need the support of our own citizens. This support is conditional on transparency and clarity. We must explain that our compatriots in Afghanistan are in serious danger, but we must also stress the importance of the mission there and that failure cannot be an option. As I have said, many important factors are at stake. Francisco José Millán Mon and José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 With regard to the resolution on the Commission’s enlargement strategy paper for 2009, we would like to make it clear, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), that the fact that we supported it overall does not in any way mean that we agree with the recognition of Kosovo as an independent State. We feel that Kosovo is an exceptional case, and we would like to point out that it has not been recognised by Spain or by four other Member States. Consequently, both in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and today in plenary, we have supported the amendments that were in line with our viewpoint. Our vote in favour of the resolution is due to the fact that we do not want our position on Kosovo to be understood as a negative attitude to the enlargement process that the countries of the Western Balkans, Turkey and Iceland are now involved in. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Madam President, the enlargement process has been a resounding success. The latest enlargement has allowed us to come together with those countries of Central and Eastern Europe that were unfairly denied freedom and prosperity after the Second World War. At present, enlargement is focusing on the western Balkans, Turkey and Iceland. I endorse the ideas that we have identified as the guiding principles of the enlargement process in recent years. I mean consolidation, conditionality and communication. That is to say, that we should fulfil our obligations, but not make rash promises on future enlargements. Secondly, progress in the various accession processes is subject to strict compliance with the conditions. The candidate countries must make a determined effort to carry out the necessary reforms. Thirdly, we must all make an effort to communicate with the citizens. The resolution we are to vote on tomorrow highlights the very important issue of communication. In this connection, I should like to reiterate the broader proposal I made on previous occasions, namely that it would be appropriate also to enhance young Europeans’ knowledge of the Union by making this a compulsory subject in the upper secondary school curriculum. Another relevant idea contained in the resolution is the capacity for integration. Enlargement requires existing Members of the Union to take certain measures. Regarding finance, for instance, enlargement calls for sufficient financial resources to ensure that essential community policies such as the common agricultural policy or cohesion policy are not put at risk. I am about to conclude. I should like to point out that as we are all aware, Kosovo is a special case. Unfortunately, however, there are sections of the resolution where this particularity is not made clear. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, with regard to the Fajon report, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to point out that, although we voted for the report, we do not agree with recital 2a, added by Amendment 4, which states that the Commission ‘should start a visa dialogue with Kosovo with a view to establishing a roadmap for visa facilitation and liberalisation similar to those established with Western Balkan countries’. In my delegation’s view, Kosovo cannot be put on the same footing as the Western Balkan countries. I would point out that Kosovo has not been recognised by the Spanish authorities or by any other Member States. Since the amendment I have mentioned was voted on in block voting with many other amendments, we were not able to vote against it, but we would like it placed on the record that we are not in agreement with its content.

Madam President, relations with Russia are very important: it is a permanent member of the Security Council and a military power; its cooperation is necessary in order to tackle the nuclear challenge of Iran, the issue of the Middle East, disarmament, climate change, etc. Moreover, Russia is a neighbouring country of Europe with which many EU Member States have significant economic relationships and high levels of energy dependence. It is a country with which we have two regular annual summits (which certainly provide a good opportunity at which to evaluate the state of the relationship). Now we are negotiating a new partnership agreement, which would increase cooperation in the so-called four ‘common spaces’. In my view, the most important of these spaces is the economic and energy space: we need openness, clear rules, guarantees for investments, and Russia first of all needs to join the WTO. Next week’s summit should therefore be an opportunity to clarify Russia’s intentions with regard to the WTO and to ensure it does not take initiatives that are incompatible with it. In addition, the gas supply crisis of recent years should not be allowed to recur and the new agreement must include the principles of the European Energy Charter which, as has already been said, is the treaty from which Moscow has unfortunately withdrawn. We must continue to work on the other three spaces as well. I have already mentioned the importance of Russia as a global player. Ladies and gentlemen, we can do many things together with Russia, but, as has also been said, there is one aspect of the relationship that we should not forget, since Russia is a European country and a neighbour. That is the need for it to respect human rights and the obligations that its membership of the Council of Europe imposes upon it in that regard. One of the most obvious failures of the EU’s external affairs policy is the lack of a common policy with regard to Russia. With the instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon, it will be simpler to create this common policy, but it is also necessary for us, as Member States, to have a genuine will to create such a united policy and not to continue prioritising bilateral channels with Moscow, which are, at times, openly divergent from each other.

 Madam President, the relationship with the United States is, strategically speaking, the European Union’s most important relationship. The United States holds a key position in the world and the European Union is increasingly becoming a global actor. We can, and should, undertake many things together. First of all, we should take a leading role in creating a new, global world, featuring new challenges and the emergence of new actors. We need to further strengthen our relationship and create new institutional mechanisms. This is the right time to undertake such action. We have a government in Washington which favours multilateralism, a European Union strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon and we are witnessing the emergence of a new world which we want to shape together. The resolution we will adopt tomorrow specifically supports the strengthening of the institutional mechanisms, something which Parliament called for in its resolution of 26 March. The decision to create the Transatlantic Economic Council two years ago was the right one. However, in today’s world, we also need to develop excellent coordination in terms of policies and security. We need regular meetings between officials responsible for external affairs and security. That is why this House, this Parliament, supported the creation of a Transatlantic Political Council which, in the future, must include the energy council that you wish to establish at the next summit. The Parliament also wants two summits to take place every year. If we have two summits with Russia, why not with the United States? Ladies and gentlemen, there is increasing talk of a G2 being set up by the United States and China, that is to say, a privileged relationship between the top global players. It worries me that we Europeans may weaken our role as partners and undermine our privileged relationship with the United States. We must explain to the United States that, in the field of foreign policy, the Union will be strengthened by the Treaty. The European Union, or the Europe of today, is no longer the problem it had been for decades. Today, in this complex world, Europe should be part of the solution, and I hope that is the way the United States sees the situation. In order for this to occur, as the Commissioner pointed out, Europeans also need to act in line with the global role we want to have, and to be up to the mark, with respect to the privileged relationship to which we aspire with the United States. To summarise, a key issue for the upcoming summit, in my opinion, should be the strengthening of transatlantic relations, including at institutional level. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

 Mr President, given the EU’s dependence on external energy supplies, securing its supply is an issue which must always form part of the EU’s external policy. In addition, all predictions agree that energy demand in the world will increase significantly over the next 25 years. Here in Europe, we have to reduce our high dependence on Russian gas, particularly following the crises in recent years. There is also a clear strategy in Russia to secure its dominance in Europe over the gas sector. That is why we have projects such as Nord Stream, Blue Stream II and also South Stream. We therefore need to diversify in terms of suppliers and routes. That is the reason for the interest in Nabucco, which will give access to Azerbaijani and Iraqi gas, and also to gas from Turkmenistan, thus reinforcing our energy relations with Central Asia, which is an increasingly important region. I am therefore delighted about the agreement reached last July, as reported by the Commissioner, and also the explicit support given to Nabucco by President Barroso in the political guidelines that he recently presented. I know that there are doubts about the viability of Nabucco, but I also had doubts about the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, which is now a reality. I must stress that the countries around the southern rim of the Mediterranean also have an important role to play in the supply of gas to Europe. The main country in this respect is Algeria, which is an important supplier of gas to my country and to Italy. We must ensure that the work on the Medgaz pipeline is quickly completed. I also want to highlight countries such as Egypt and Libya in terms of gas supplies. To sum up, energy issues must be a priority in the Euro-Mediterranean relationship, to the benefit of both sides. Ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon includes energy as a shared responsibility and lays down that one of the EU’s energy policy objectives will be to guarantee the security of energy supplies. This really encourages us to move forward with developing an increasingly essential common foreign policy on energy, as stressed by the motion for a resolution to be adopted today. I will end by saying that this is a difficult objective, as proven by our failure in Europe, in the European Union, to achieve a true internal market in energy, because we do not even have the necessary interconnections. That is why I am delighted about the commitments made in this respect in the document mentioned by President Barroso. Francisco José Millán Mon  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I am here to talk about Iran, and I would first like to join in expressing my condolences for the victims of this morning’s plane crash. Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with many of the ideas that have already been expressed regarding the situation in Iran following the electoral process. This process was neither free nor fair, and has allowed President Ahmadinejad and the most radical sectors of the regime to remain in power, violently repressing demonstrators, preventing journalists from doing their job and seeking to hold a supposed external conspiracy responsible for internal disorder, while using misinformation to conceal the truth. What is certain is that the Iranian regime has been seriously damaged, both internally and in terms of its external image. Moreover, the oligarchy that has enjoyed power in recent decades is now divided, which will affect the stability of the regime. At the same time, discontent among the people will continue to grow, especially if oil prices do not rise again and consequently the economic situation does not improve. The European Union needs to maintain a united front and continue to condemn the abuses committed in Iran. It should demand greater respect for human rights, and we also need to look at how we can help civil society, in particular those sectors that want democratic pluralism and respect for human rights for their country. We should not disappoint those sectors that are looking to the West, including the European Union. However, with regard to Iran we must also not forget the threat that its nuclear programme represents, as it is having a destabilising effect on the region and on non-proliferation in general. It is essential that the European Union and the United States continue to cooperate on this matter, and I am sure that this will be a priority for the Swedish Presidency. We need to fully involve Russia and China, which are permanent members of the Security Council. Their support is essential in order for a negotiated solution to be found to this grave threat, which requires unity and firmness from the international community. I therefore welcome the resolution adopted in this respect last week at the G8. Ladies and gentlemen, the events of the last few weeks have openly demonstrated the extremism and radical nature of the current Iranian leaders; it is clear that the international community cannot afford for them to obtain nuclear weapons.

Mr President, Commissioner, these are tough times for the European fisheries sector. The serious economic crisis that is devastating Europe, the scarcity of marine resources needed to allow the fleets to be economically viable and the negotiations on agreements that are often unacceptable because of their detrimental interests, mean that the sector is looking towards the future with some concern. If we add to that the shameful obstruction of the multiannual plans by the Council, which is also seeking pretexts for reneging on the Treaty itself – something that we absolutely will not stand for – we end up with a panorama that is pretty bleak. We are discussing different aspects of great importance, including the external dimension of the common fisheries policy, which enables the EU fleet to fish in the high seas and in third-country waters, and through which the European Union also exports principles of good governance, leading the fight for sustainability, ensuring food security in the least-developed countries and eradicating illegal fishing. In all, 60 % of the fish consumed in the European Union comes from third-country imports and, as a consequence, one of the objectives of the external dimension of this policy must be to ensure the continuity of the economically viable high-sea fishing. We do not agree that the fisheries agreements should entail an exclusivity clause that prevents the European fleet from fishing in third-country waters when the European Union has failed to conclude a new protocol and we have several examples of that. Nor do we agree that there should be penalties for the temporary reflagging of EU vessels when they change their flag so that they can access third-country waters – even if those countries comply with all of the international regulations – where no agreement on access to resources has been reached. Similarly, we do not agree with the fact that the fishing authorisation fees that shipowners have to pay to access the fishery resources of a third country can triple on occasion without a cost-benefit analysis having been carried out. In my opinion, it is pointless to propose keeping fish stocks above, rather than at, maximum sustainable yield, as this would reduce fishing opportunities by more than is necessary. For these and other reasons, our group has tabled an alternative motion for a resolution, which, in our opinion, improves the rapporteur’s proposal. In conclusion, Commissioner – and I see that the Council is absent once again – fisheries is such an important sector that it is crucial for the three institutions to be able to reach agreement and work towards the same goal. Parliament certainly will. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

I am a firm advocate of programmes aimed at education and young people and specifically of the Erasmus programme, and I am concerned by the news regarding its immediate future. However, as a Member from an outermost region such as the Canary Islands, I am also concerned that our young people do not enjoy equal opportunities in the mobility measures financed by the EU. Young people from the Canary Islands cannot and should not be in a worse situation than other young people in the EU due to living in an outermost region. Youth unemployment figures in the outermost regions are really worrying and it is our duty to ensure that the additional cost of students travelling from their outermost region of origin is borne by the programme itself and not by the students, who often see this additional cost as an insurmountable obstacle that prevents them from accessing Erasmus grants. Yes there should be Erasmus for all, but that should include young people from the outermost regions. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, I am not going to talk about independence for Catalonia, I am going to talk about La Gomera, a small island which is part of the Canary Islands and which has experienced an appalling fire, a fire which began on 4 August and was not extinguished officially until last month, in September. Not only has the fire affected the Garajonay National Park, which has been a World Heritage site since 1986, it has also scorched around 11 % of the surface area of the island, and more than 4 000 people have had to be evacuated. The damage caused to the environment, to the economy and to the living conditions of the islanders has been estimated at around EUR 60 million and is very difficult to rectify. So, what I would like to talk about today is solidarity, the solidarity of Europe with a very small but very important part of the Europe which unites us, about Europe’s solidarity with La Gomera and its inhabitants. The Spanish Government has already requested the intervention of the Solidarity Fund. All that remains now is for it to become effective and for us to help La Gomera to move forward. We are talking about the future of the island and that future is something for which we are all responsible. Gabriel Mato Adrover,

Mr President, Commissioner, based on the fact that in my view the agreements with Peru, Colombia and Central America are tremendously damaging for European banana producers, and the Canary Islands in particular, and that the only safety margin we have left is economic compensation via the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), which I hope is obtained, I have to express my satisfaction, given that these reports have included many of our proposals, which I am grateful for. The negotiated safeguard clauses have been improved and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas has been strengthened. There will be greater transparency and exhaustive monitoring of banana imports into the European Union with prior surveillance measures. Moreover, and what I believe is an essential point, the Commission shall present an annual report on how the clause is functioning, which should include an examination of the development of banana imports and their impact on European production. These are all very positive elements. European banana producers, all of which also come from the outermost regions, need help during these difficult times. There still some way to go, but this is a very significant step. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, if I may, I shall use my speech in this joint debate on fisheries policy in order to make some demands. Today, we are debating good reports that properly define Parliament’s efforts to achieve sustainable fishing by preserving fish stocks, and which try to establish a common organisation of the markets in which consumers are not only protected but also well informed. In addition, we are stressing the need to take action against those who authorise unsustainable fishing, and we are doing so by discussing, debating and reaching agreements. Unfortunately, however, those efforts clash with the actions of those who sometimes confuse confidentiality with a lack of transparency, with protocol negotiations carried out behind Parliament’s back and, what is worse, behind the backs of those who should be benefiting from the very same agreement. Commissioner Damanaki, there is still time to rectify this situation. Please do so. Our efforts also clash with those who are less concerned about blocking instruments that are fundamental to developing the sector as they are about not losing powers which even the Treaty does not bestow on them. Mr Mavroyiannis, we still have time. Stop blocking the management plans. It is important for the fishing industry and therefore for the citizens of Europe and for us. Therefore, at a time of uncertainty with so many boats and so few fishing opportunities, with fierce competition from imported products and a considerable reduction in subsidies, we have an obligation to support this reform. We should do so bearing in mind the fishermen in Galicia, Andalusia, the Canary Islands and all the other regions of Europe. They expect something very simple from us: that we do not let them down. Gabriel Mato Adrover,

Mr President, Commissioner, I want to clearly express, with the resolution and conviction given to us by the force of reason, the Committee on Fisheries’ unanimous concern when it comes to possible agreements under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) on state responsibility for vessels’ activities. Ladies and gentlemen, in the fishing regulations of both the European Union and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), there is an overall principle that is paradigm in the regulation to control fishing activities and the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing: it establishes that the flag state is primarily responsible for controlling its vessels’ activities, wherever they work. Based on this principle, the flag state must, for example, certify that their vessels’ catches conform to legislation. This catch certification is essential to these catches being unloaded in EU ports and being sent to market. However, it is also essential to respect the adopted conservation and fishing management measures, the objective of which is to ultimately bring fish stocks up to sustainable levels for fishing. Many states without their own fleet must charter ships from other countries to fish, which is natural, as long as they comply with the legal requirements. That said, Commissioner, you are aware, as we all are, that many of these chartering states have neither the resources, the capacity, nor often the will to control the fishing activities of these vessels. You will agree that, if there is no guarantee of an effective control of fishing activities, it is absolutely impossible to fight against illegal fishing and it is very difficult to aid sustainability, which is the cornerstone of our common fisheries policy (CFP) and the focus of its reform, which we are currently debating in Parliament. In the latest CITES meeting, the Working Group on Introduction from the Sea discussed the flag state’s responsibility over the species covered by CITES, and proposed to transfer this responsibility to the chartering state for CITES species caught on the high seas. This working group will report to the Standing Committee of the Convention in July 2012 and this committee, in turn, will report to the Conference of the Parties (COP) at the March 2013 meeting, when a definitive decision will be taken. According to my information on the European Union, the Commission held a meeting with the Member States last Monday. During this meeting, the Commission appears to have inexplicably announced that there is no official position, that is, that the Member States are free to adopt whichever position they consider to be most convenient for their interests in the upcoming COP. If this is the case, Commissioner, you can understand that it is both disappointing and discouraging that the Commission has not taken a stand on such a vital issue, particularly during a period when we are reforming the CFP. I have been informed that in the coming days, there will be a meeting between Member States and the Commission itself to adopt a common position. I think that there is still time to rectify the situation and for the Commission to send out a clear and resounding message, preventing the derogation of what has been the basic principle up until now: the flag state’s responsibility. This issue is a lot more important than some irresponsibly believe. If the proposal goes ahead, it will set a precedent that will undoubtedly cause great harm to our fisheries management and to the fight against illegal fishing. The Commission cannot allow all the work undertaken hitherto to be thrown away. It has been a joint effort on two aspects in which Parliament is completely involved and which also involves regional organisations such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) or the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) itself. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will finish. Under no circumstances, in my opinion, should the charter state be granted responsibility for controlling their vessels’ activity; this must remain the flag state’s responsibility. This is the unequivocal position of the Committee on Fisheries of this Parliament, and I hope it is also that of the Commission itself. For that reason, I ask if the Commission could explain its position on the issue and how it will ensure that the primary responsibility of the flag state is maintained. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, we are debating herring, we are debating multiannual plans, but essentially, we are debating jurisdiction, the competencies of Parliament and the need for the Council to accept and most importantly respect what was established in the Treaty of Lisbon, and furthermore, to respect the decision of the legal services themselves. This is codecision and in this context, a political decision by the Council that not only calls into question the competencies of Parliament, something which we cannot or should not allow of course, but most importantly, puts the future of such essential issues as the reform of the common fisheries policy at risk. I am addressing the absent Council members and also the Commissioner today; I think the issue is much more important than some believe. Give some thought to the matter. Gabriel Mato Adrover,

Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, please believe me when I say that, with this being my first speech before this House as chair of the Committee on Fisheries, I would rather not have had to make it, because we are not only going to talk about fishing, total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas – although these are very important – but also issues of jurisdiction. The question I asked on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries relates to the Treaty of Lisbon and how it should be applied in the area of fisheries policies, and, as I said previously, this goes much further than an isolated discrepancy. It concerns the undertaking by the three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – to accept the rules of the game that we agreed upon, based on the premise which underlies the Treaty: to take appropriate decisions, each according to its responsibilities, in the interests of the citizens of Europe. There is no doubt that the new Treaty has made major changes to the decision-making process for fisheries policy, and understandably it is going to take time to make the necessary adjustments to ensure that the new procedures operate correctly and in full. However, unfortunately we have learned from experience in the two years since the Treaty came into force that the Council and, in some cases, the Commission continue to deliberately – or so I believe – put up obstacles in an attempt to prevent Parliament from exercising its new prerogatives. This is unacceptable. Parliament cannot accept under any circumstances that the Council should continue to operate as if nothing had changed, as if Parliament were a mere bystander and the Treaty of Lisbon and the new division of competences had never existed. Minister, Commissioner, whether you like it or not, Parliament cannot be excluded from making decisions on fisheries policy, whether internal or external. These are not my words, they are the Treaty’s. Now, once again, following the Commission’s proposal, the Council has sought to exceed the scope of Article 43(3) of the Treaty, quite unacceptably in our view, in an attempt to exclude Parliament’s voice from the decision-making process. The procedure laid down in this article clearly refers to the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, that is, decisions on TACs and quotas, and to these two aspects alone – not to a whole series of other measures for achieving the objectives of the common fisheries policy, which would be covered by Article 43(2). As is stated in the preamble to the question, technical measures, such as prohibition or restricted zones and periods, restricted fishing depths and specific requirements related to fishing gear can in no way be interpreted as falling under the remit of Article 43(3). Parliament’s position is quite clear. We have been stating it for some time now: you cannot take a broad interpretation which is in clear contradiction with any exceptional status. Our reaction, in various dossiers, has always been to seek proportionate measures. We clashed over the Venezuela–French Guiana dossier, when the Council decided to forge ahead without Parliament’s consent. We had no alternative than to go to the European Court of Justice. Also when we opposed the Council’s blocking of long-term plans for hake and anchovy; we disagreed and we chose the first reading to try to negotiate seriously with the Council for a second reading. In terms of TAC and quota regulations we have been even more tolerant, if that is possible. It has not escaped our attention that what was adopted in 2010 and 2011 – in both cases on the basis of Article 43(3) – was done incorrectly. We continued to insist that sufficient time should elapse before the Council and the Commission could take joint decisions and were operating correctly. However, now of course we realise that in this case they are introducing a recital on certain conditions, functionally linked to the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, when clearly the concept of associated conditions, formerly covered in Article 20 of the Regulation, has been explicitly omitted from the new Treaty. The Members of the European Parliament thought that we should allow some time to elapse. However, we are – and I say this clearly – most disappointed because in 2012, three years after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, there are still major discrepancies between what the Commission proposes and what the Council approve, on the one hand, and what the Regulation states on the other. In my view, neither institution has given any indication that it is willing to abandon this broad interpretation of Article 43(3) for once and for all, and adopt another procedure that is more respectful of Parliament’s prerogatives. To conclude, there is unanimity among groups, coordinators and all the Members. We have made our approach very clear in our oral questions and I would like the Commission and the Council to answer the questions we have put to them today just as clearly. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, the feelings of hundreds of thousands of farmers in many regions in Spain can be summed up in a simple but resounding word: ‘no’. We say ‘no’ to an unbalanced agreement; ‘no’ to an agreement without even a single guarantee that customs duties will be paid or fraud prevented; ‘no’ to an agreement that allows unfair competition against our farmers, inducing them to abandon their crops. In short, we say ‘no’ to the disappearance of fruit and vegetable farmers in regions such as Andalusia, Murcia and the Canary Islands. Our ‘no’ should not come as any surprise. It is a consistent ‘no’, just like our consistent ‘yes’ to the fishing agreement. We have not changed tack. We are defending today what we defended last July in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. We voted against then, and we will vote against once more on Thursday, because nothing has changed. However, we do not want anyone to see this as a ‘no’ against the Kingdom of Morocco, which is a preferential partner, and should continue to be one in the future. While Morocco may benefit from the European Commission’s inability to amend the regulation on entry prices, it is not responsible for it. I will finish by saying that our ‘no’ today is also a ‘yes’. It is a clear ‘yes’ to our farmers; a ‘yes’ to reciprocity and strict respect for agreements; a ‘yes’ to good relations between the European Union and third countries; a ‘yes’ to being able to continue farming; and lastly a ‘yes’ to differences being defined by quality, not by fraud. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is clear that something is wrong when we are debating an extension today, in the month of December, which ends in scarcely two months. Nonetheless, we are discussing an agreement that is important to the European Union and to Spain in particular, an agreement that cannot be used as an excuse for diverse claims that are not strictly fishing based, and one which I agree should be extended despite the fact that many aspects of the agreement are unsatisfactory. I have always defended agreements with third countries, and even more so with neighbouring countries and those of such importance as the Kingdom of Morocco. It is precisely for that reason that I hope that the extension will be ratified and that a new agreement is negotiated, which is balanced, fair and beneficial for all signatories and allows our fleet to continue working. I am confident that this agreement will be reached, and that, as well as being economically viable and guaranteeing the sustainability and conservation of resources, it will also have positive consequences for the signatories from a social and working perspective. However, I also robustly defend that the agreements must be respected and comprehensively fulfilled, and for that reason and to be consistent, I questioned the agreement with Morocco for the agricultural sector and I emphatically support the agreement for the fishing sector. We do not have anything against Morocco, quite the opposite, but this does not detract from the fact that we demand that the agreements are respected as is deserved by the citizens we represent. This Parliament should send a clear and open message to the Commission that they should negotiate and negotiate well, without delay and with transparency. Remember that poor negotiations always bring poor consequences. There are many examples. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, much has been said over recent days about the volcano on the island of El Hierro, in the Canary Islands. I was there last Friday and experienced for myself, along with the people of El Hierro, an earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale. I can assure you that it was not a pleasant situation to be in. However, it was even more unpleasant to see the situation in which the thousands of inhabitants of this small and very European island find themselves, with their lives determined by the volcano and continuous seismic activity. The tunnel linking the two main cities on the island is closed, people cannot go out to fish, and businesses are being closed down. People are seeing a major crisis grow to terrible proportions, and they can do nothing but wait. This wait is unsustainable from an economic perspective. Fishermen, farmers, small business owners, hoteliers and society as a whole all urgently need Europe’s assistance and economic support in order to tackle not only the present situation, but also an uncertain future. The European Union must be where it is needed. That place today, more than ever, is the island of El Hierro. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, it is precisely in situations of crisis that the efficiency of and confidence in institutions is seen. In this case, they have left much to be desired. The Commission has said precisely that suspicions about Spanish cucumbers have not been confirmed. No, Commissioner: what has been confirmed is that the suspicions were unfounded, irresponsible and without objective data; what has been confirmed is that there are 23 dead and that the Spanish horticultural sector has suffered enormous damage. What has also been confirmed is that the Commission must do what it has not done up to now, which is to act with conviction on various fronts: stop the outbreak; prevent unfounded suspicions from being given a glimmer of credibility, seriously affecting a Member State – in this case, Spain – by taking the necessary measures to achieve this; compensate the damage suffered without delay and restore to the Spanish brand its image of safe, very high quality agricultural products. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, the best thing about asking a question is that you get an answer, even if, in this case, it could be considered disappointing in some ways. The fisheries sector is clearly in crisis: fishers’ incomes are lower every day, making it difficult to continue working in this field in many cases. We are not talking about stealth subsidies or unsustainable practices: we are talking about problems that require our full support. We suggest it time and again, and reiterating a fair demand, as Mr Cadec has done, cannot be reproached: he is being consistent. Nobody has suggested increasing fishing efforts. We do not understand why measures that are immediately relevant to exceptional situations have to be rejected. We are just suggesting that the Commission not turn its back on a sector that urgently needs aid, and this aid can, today, be an increase in de minimis
 aid. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, the tomato growers of the Canary Islands, Murcia, Andalusia and the Community of Valencia, all of them European Union producers, need the Commission to take robust action with regard to an unfair situation which is causing them serious damage. Fraud is being committed, and you know it. Thanks to its agreement with the EU, Morocco benefits from an entry price to which it does not adhere. In addition, we should not only look at 2007, but also at 2010. The Commission is well aware that Spanish tomato growers have to compete with Moroccan growers under unfair conditions, as they must bear much higher production costs stemming from the strict European standards on quality, food safety and workplace safety, as well as restrictions on pesticides which are not required of third countries. Even so, our growers, with great effort and commitment to quality, continue to work hard to save their crops. Thus, it is unacceptable for the Commission to ignore the malfunctioning of the entry price regime, whose complexity encourages fraud, as the European Anti-Fraud Office itself does, and for the Commission to look the other way when the tomato quotas agreed with Morocco are being contravened. It is not enough for the Commission to tell us that surveillance is the responsibility of the Member States. If they fail in their duties, the Commission must act. It is intolerable for regulations on Moroccan import quotas to be breached, and for the applicable customs duties to go unpaid, without the Commission taking any action. The Commission would have us approve a new agreement with Morocco. Unless we are given assurances that the price system will be modified to prevent unfair competition between Moroccan and Spanish produce, we will certainly not be supporting that initiative. It is your obligation to ensure adherence to agreements, but it is also your obligation to defend the interests of growers in the Canary Islands, Murcia, Valencia, and Andalusia. Do it before it is too late. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Madam President, I would respectfully inform Mr Campbell Bannerman that his banana is not from the Canary Islands. Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to talk about bananas in this plenary sitting and I think that it is positive that bananas are being talked about here. It is positive because it is important to reiterate the need for EU banana producers to be protected, including those in the Canaries. I think this because I believe that the conclusion of the Geneva Agreement on Trade in Bananas is not good news for EU producers. Moreover, there are aspects of the resolution that we are debating today that are not completely satisfactory from the point of view of agriculture and of protecting EU banana producers. However, I am aware that this proposal originates with the Committee on International Trade, whose criteria relating to several issues are very different from those that I am able to have. I will therefore assess the positive aspects of the proposal and not the negative ones. It is positive that it brings to a close so many years of disputes in the World Trade Organisation, thus restoring tranquillity to a sector that needs certainty and stability for the future above all else. EU producers belong to the outermost regions, which have enormous problems producing bananas – or excellent-quality ones, anyway – and whose banana production is nothing like that in third countries in any respect, including in terms of cost, workforce, the environment or of plant protection safeguards. From an agricultural point of view, it is important to stress that the agreement is damaging to EU producers. We are facing drastic cuts in tariffs, from EUR 176 to EUR 114 per tonne and EUR 75 per tonne in the case of the agreements with Colombia and Peru. Therefore, Commissioner, with all due respect, I can tell you that it is not credible that there were provisions for this drop in tariffs in the financial detail of the 2006 Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), because it is not true. The Commissioner said that it was provided for in relation to the Geneva Agreement; let us bear in mind that this tariff is EUR 114. There could never have been provision in 2006 for the tariff to decrease to EUR 75 as there is following these agreements. I therefore believe that the necessary evaluations should be carried out and it will be confirmed that it is absolutely necessary for the financial details of the agreement to be updated because, inter alia
, the Commission already saw the tariff of EUR 176 per tonne itself as low when it was implemented. EU producers are not, therefore, asking for anything that is not wholly justified, and we in Parliament have an obligation to protect them, as does the Commission. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, in my speech, I am going to focus on two reports whose procedure and final results are an example of what to do and what not to do. I am referring to the plan for anchovy stocks and the use of exotic species in aquaculture. Regarding anchovies, an example of how not to do things, the subject has been under discussion for more than one year and, unfortunately, it has become a debate on the powers that the Treaty of Lisbon grants to Parliament and on the legal basis for the Commission proposal, rather than a debate on what is better for fishermen, industries and fisheries. It has been a long and futile debate, the victim of which has been the sector, which has looked on in astonishment as we have become lost in discussions while the long-awaited management plan has yet to move forward and is in danger of never seeing the light of day. People who work in the anchovy sector are rightly complaining about the administrative hindrances that this plan is facing, when it is so essential for avoiding further interruptions to the activities of this fishery. I sincerely believe that, given this background of uncertainty, the Commission should seek to send a positive signal to the sector today in Parliament. On the contrary, with regard to the use of exotic species, the agreement reached by Parliament at first reading is a good compromise. The Commission, the Council and Parliament have succeeded in reaching an agreement quickly and without major disagreements over law or fact. The agreement not only establishes a strict definition of closed aquaculture facilities, but also achieves greater legal clarity for the businesses in the sector and, more importantly, removes a piece of the bureaucracy that Europeans have had enough of. I am convinced that the administrative processes need to be reduced to an essential minimum. Europeans have to deal with excessive bureaucracy, which makes it extremely difficult to start up or operate any activity. Therefore, reports such as today’s that remove administrative procedures are not only good news for the aquaculture sector but should also be a constant feature of the way in which we work.

Madam President, I am also going to talk about Venezuela, because there are some people who do not understand that democracy is not just about casting votes. Democracy is being able to do so with security, freedom and equality, and in a democracy and under a system of freedoms, private property must also be respected. Unfortunately, at present in Venezuela, the public and their businesses are under threat. In this respect, I would like to mention one business, Agroisleña, which was founded by people from the Canary Islands and on which more than 1 000 families depend. It has been unfairly expropriated, and like so many other businesses, after many years of hard work, it is failing, following capricious decisions by those who think that anything goes. First, land was confiscated, now businesses are being confiscated, so who knows what will be next? It is time for the people of Venezuela to feel free and for businesspeople to no longer feel defenceless and permanently under threat. As has already been said, it is time for Venezuela to be a genuine democracy where there is no doubt that terrorists will not find refuge. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, if we are talking about territorial cohesion, we have to talk about islands, mountain regions and also the outermost regions. It means talking about their problems and difficulties, their natural disadvantages and their structural handicaps. However, it also fundamentally means talking about how we can remove the obstacles that prevent their development. It means talking about strategies for converting those disadvantages into opportunities. Improving connectivity, an adequate neighbourhood policy and stability in policies and in the Structural Funds are issues that we need to tackle without hesitation, on the basis of two major premises: territorial cohesion and the principle of solidarity. There are people who do not believe in strategies. I do believe in them, and this resolution should be proof of Parliament’s commitment to these regions and of its demand for the Commission to make political decisions that take into account the needs of these vulnerable areas, whose problems become even more harshly evident in times of economic crisis such as we are experiencing at the moment.

Madam President, it is two years and one month today since the air accident that claimed 154 victims at Barajas Airport, Madrid, and tore apart many families, most of which were in the Canary Islands. All Members share their pain. Unfortunately, today, two years later, the technical investigation has not been concluded. The victims’ families are still wondering what happened and they have no answers. I find this state of affairs regrettable for two fundamental reasons: firstly, because the victims’ families do not deserve it, and secondly, because important information that would be fundamental for air safety and could be essential to preventing further incidents is not coming to light. I trust that this regulation that we will adopt tomorrow will at least, among other things, help to speed up the technical investigation processes and to ensure that these situations are not repeated. I share the concerns expressed by my colleague, Mr de Grandes, and I congratulate the rapporteur on achieving an agreement at first reading, but I hope that we have not given in on too many things in order to satisfy certain interests: it is the victims that are important here and they come first. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, once again, we are going to talk about free trade agreements between the European Union and third countries. I have already spoken about the agreements with Colombia and Peru, which are extremely damaging to the banana industry in the Canary Islands, and today, I wish to talk about Morocco. On 16 September, the Commission adopted its proposal on a new agricultural chapter of the association agreement with Morocco: a proposal that increases the tomato quotas, maintains the October to May period instead of extending it to the whole year, and does not revise the entry price system which has been proven to be fraudulent, as recognised by The European Anti-Fraud Office itself. This agreement is lethal for EU producers, essentially in Andalusia, Murcia, Valencia and the Canary Islands, and the Commission is perfectly aware of that. The Commission cannot look the other way and propose a fresh agreement with no guarantees when the current agreement is being violated without any measures being taken. There needs to be an urgent review of the entry price system and I ask the Commission to undertake one without further delay. The Commission has an obligation to defend farmers, so defend them! Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Madam President, this is not the first time that I have spoken about Venezuela and the breaches of human rights that are occurring in that beautiful country and I fear it will not be the last. During my previous speech I referred to journalists. Today I am referring to judges such as Judge Afiuni, and as always to ordinary Venezuelans, who, like the thousands of canaries that live there, only want to live in peace and freedom. These people aspire to safeguard their land and their affairs without the permanent uncertainty of ‘what will happen tomorrow’. Venezuela has been a land of refuge for many. Today, unfortunately, it is a country where freedom of expression and other freedoms and rights are mere memories. We are talking here today about human rights and who is breaching them. May our support go out from here to Judge Afiuni, and to everyone living in Venezuela, together with our hope that political freedoms will once more be a reality. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with a reform that is simple but extremely important for the outermost regions. This is especially the case at a time when the crisis is affecting everyone, but is affecting these regions in a fundamental way, as they have permanent structural handicaps that mean that they need these changes. I am going to talk about the Canary Islands. In the case of the Canary Islands, the most important change is regarding supplies of milk-based preparations intended for industrial processing. We are talking about skimmed milk powder with vegetable fat, which is a traditional product for local consumers that has been sold in the Canary Islands for more than 40 years. After a great deal of effort and despite many difficulties, a local industry was established that generates employment and obvious added value. I would like to highlight this because, in the current times, particularly on our islands, which have extremely high unemployment, supporting a small industry that creates jobs is not only a necessity but an obligation. The proposal is to maintain the supply of this product, which is used for local consumption in small quantities of 800 tonnes per year. This would eliminate the transitional nature of the measure, which is of little importance in the global context, and therefore give stability to this industry. As I said before, the outermost regions have significant handicaps, but they must be considered an opportunity for Europe. The different association agreements that are being worked on and debated at the moment, such as the free trade agreements with Colombia and Peru and others on which negotiations are beginning, such as with Mercosur, are a clear threat to our agricultural sector. I am thinking about numerous products: tomatoes, bananas, and the livestock sector. I have said this many times: these agreements must achieve a balance, whereby everyone surrenders a little ground, so we all win. However, in no way must one product or one specific sector be forced to bear the cost of the agreements. Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Alves, and thank the Commission and the Council who, along with Parliament, have succeeded in reaching an agreement in this first trialogue on agriculture. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
).

 Madam President, I am going to talk about tourism, a fundamental sector for the Canary Islands, which receive around 12 million tourists per year. If there is one thing that tourism needs, it is certainty. Situations like the one that we have experienced – and which may be repeated – have dramatic consequences for this strategic sector for the Canary Islands. The losses have not only been suffered by the airlines, the airports and the tour operators: hotels, car hire companies, restaurants and services in general have suffered huge damage. Between 15 and 23 April alone, 313 818 aeroplane seats were cancelled in the Canary Islands, with losses of around EUR 57.3 million as a result of the tourists not coming. This is, of course, a significant loss. We need immediate measures when the event occurs, such as opening airports at night without additional costs and looking after the public, the passengers, properly; but we also need compensation. I am not going to criticise what was done or what was not done or say whether the crisis was managed well or not. It is only worth being aware that it could happen again and that we need to be prepared for it. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
).

Mr President, last week Europe missed a great opportunity: the opportunity to be the world leader in astrophysical research for the next twenty years. The European Southern Observatory decided, on the basis of reports which were far from transparent, that the European Very Large Telescope would be located in Chile and not in the Canaries. This is a time to congratulate Chile, but also to reflect on whether in Europe everything possible was done to have a European installation, decided on by a European institution, with European funding involving an investment of more than EUR 1 billion, located in Europe rather than in the Americas. The European Parliament was unanimous in its support for locating it in La Palma and I am grateful for that, but what did the Council do? What did the Spanish Presidency do? Did it hold any meetings with the Observatory? Did it hold any meetings with any of those Member States responsible for deciding on the location of the telescope? Did it really support the European bid? Europeans from La Palma, the Canaries and the rest of Europe are waiting for answers on this. At the moment they are left with the conviction that not everything was done that could have been done. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
).

 Mr President, although it is merely an administrative issue for certain people, for others it is much more. We are talking about freedom. I know that for some people freedom must be defended in certain ways and in certain places. However, I also know that for some people, true freedom, their own freedom, is one that is imposed by certain dictators whom they defend and in some cases they even encourage and not the freedom of people like us who defend this word to its fullest extent, who believe in free media and who believe that land cannot be taken by decree. You should ask the thousands of people from the Canary Islands who have been subjected to this situation in Venezuela. We are talking about rights, plurality and freedom. Unfortunately, certain people do not believe in this yet. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, last December, the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco entered into an agreement to liberalise trade in agricultural products. Unfortunately, the only information we have on the content of this agreement has been gleaned from the media. This information indicates an increase in the quota for tomatoes imported into the European Union, something we categorically reject, as the Kingdom of Morocco has repeatedly failed to honour its obligations to the European Union. The European Commission refuses to admit to the existence of this situation, even though OLAF itself has done so. We cannot allow the Commission to continue turning a blind eye, disregarding the needs of producers in the Canary Islands, Andalusia, Murcia and Alicante. We therefore appeal strongly for agreements to be honoured and for more attention to be paid to plant health controls. In addition, the timetable for Moroccan exports should be made more flexible, allowing exports to be spread across the entire year. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, the situation in the agricultural sector is not only of concern. I would call it unsustainable: farmers’ incomes are declining and every day there is a greater difference between what farmers receive and the market price for consumers. Succession is already a Utopia, and association agreements are repeatedly infringed, as in the shameful case of tomatoes from Morocco, a situation that has been recognised by the European Anti-Fraud Office with no decisive action by the Commission. Plant health rules and controls are applied to varying degrees, creating entirely unfair situations. If we add to this isolated cases, such as the decrease in duty for the banana sector, which is going to have entirely negative consequences, or the fact that it is impossible for livestock farmers to afford input costs, you will agree with me that the future of the sector is, at the very least, uncertain. Moreover, for agriculture in the most remote regions, the future is not only uncertain but extremely worrying. Farmers want to continue farming, but it is becoming more difficult for them every day. The Commission must accept the importance of agriculture. Face up to it boldly! Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, agreements should be honoured and rules should bind everyone equally. This statement, which may seem obvious, is not so obvious in reality when we are talking about the Association Agreement between the European Union and Morocco, which contains consistent irregularities, as recognised by the European Anti-Fraud Office. Spanish tomato producers, particularly in the Canary Islands, are going through a difficult time, and need the agreement to be honoured, but also want to know what the Commission plans to do about the new agreement that is still being negotiated: whether an increase has been offered in the preferential tomato quota and under what terms, whether the entry price system is going to be changed to prevent further breaches in the future, and whether the plant health requirements demanded of European producers are going to be enforced. Also, while we are talking about agreements, banana producers are also following negotiations, in some cases bilateral negotiations with third countries, with a great deal of concern, because such dealings could have irreparable consequences if they do not go hand in hand with compensatory measures. In both cases, the Commission cannot abandon its producers and we cannot allow that to happen. Gabriel Mato Adrover  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, a fire is always a tragedy, a tragedy for people, a tragedy for the environment, an economic and social tragedy. I had the misfortune to live very close to this tragedy, to the fire that took place this summer on the island of La Palma in the Canaries. I therefore welcome this resolution and I am convinced that we are going to be able to adopt it unanimously. It is a complete resolution, which has received many contributions and which, above all, does something important. First of all, it remembers the victims, all the victims, and pays tribute to all those who work voluntarily to put the fires out. However, it also includes some significant reflections on the importance of drought and desertification in the spread of the fires, and the resulting disappearance of hundreds of thousands of hectares per year. There are also important reflections on the causes that aggravate the fires, such as the gradual abandonment of the countryside, deficient maintenance of the forests and inadequate punishment for arsonists. In this respect, we need to act and we need to act firmly. The Commission needs to draw up a risk prevention strategy and an effective strategy for combating natural disasters, and a protocol for uniform action. However, aid is also important, for restoration, for re-establishing production potential and for compensating for the social costs and job losses. As the Commissioner said, coordination is vital. However, there needs to be coordination between the different Community instruments: the Structural Funds, the Solidarity Fund – which clearly needs to be reformed – and their flexibility, and also instruments such as Aid Plus and, of course, the rapid response mechanism that we have already discussed. We need to go further in solving these problems, and I sincerely believe that this resolution is the right way to do so. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I believe that the thing we politicians must be able to tackle is unforeseen circumstances. I believe the European Council tackled the unforeseen, and I think it did well – and I say this standing alongside my friend Mr Atkins – in not giving in to Mr Cameron’s blackmail. I also believe it did well in seeking an alternative solution, the intergovernmental treaty. Sometimes, God moves in mysterious ways. We have an intergovernmental treaty that will be easier to approve than the reform of Article 48, and which will come into force sooner. The crux of the matter – and I am addressing the President of the European Council, my friend Herman Van Rompuy – is to do it quickly and for Parliament to be involved in the exercise. This seems fundamental because, returning to the metaphor of the lunch used previously by Mr Verhofstadt, I believe that if the European Council makes this lunch without Parliament, there will be no dessert.

 Mr President, President of the Commission, today was an important day, and Mr Barroso’s speech was an important one. I think you have achieved a good result, because you have established the three Cs: courage, credibility and confidence. It has been said here that the Community method is antiquated. However, the Community method has brought us many years of peace and prosperity. The Commission plays a vital role in that method; indeed, it lies at the very heart of it. It is therefore very significant that today, at this time of crisis and confusion when our people are asking for guidance, the President of the European Commission has made such a committed speech. Mr Barroso, you can count on Parliament’s political support when those commitments are turned into initiatives. I offer you my congratulations. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Madam President, I do not think this is the first debate we have held on this topic in Parliament. We had it in 2008, 2010 was the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion when we put forward a written declaration, and we are now putting an oral question to the Commission. What I mean is that, firstly, Parliament has always been concerned about this problem, which is a real one, because one often hears it said that we are preoccupied with institutional issues in which people are not interested. Institutional issues are important, but the issue of poverty is a genuine one and those of us who are present here tonight are demonstrating our concern. Secondly, it is true that – as the Commissioner has said – the action plans are essentially national plans. This is so. However, it is true that we can also do things at a European level. We did this – as Ms Berès will recall – when, at the insistence of this Parliament, we included the reference to social exclusion in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the struggle against poverty among the EU’s goals. I believe that very soon, we shall have the opportunity to take concrete action. I am referring to the debate and vote on the European Union budgets. These will take place very shortly and I think this will be an opportunity for demonstrating our commitment. The third point I should like to make, Madam President, is that it is very important to combat social exclusion and to combat poverty, but it is even more important to respect human dignity. A person suffering from poverty is one who possesses all the fundamental human rights, and we need to recognise this. Recently, I watched a film on Father Brezinski which I would recommend that my colleagues see, because this film demonstrates that the fight against inequalities is closely linked to the fight for dignity. Finally, Madam President, I would not wish to overlook one fact. From certain speeches, it would seem as if the defence of the European social model were the exclusive heritage of one particular political group in this Chamber. This is not the case. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and in all groups place great importance on the European social model, because this defines us, and because this is part of our identity. Therefore, I think that together – and both this question and the resolution show this – we will continue to fight for it to remain so. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).

 Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon grants Parliament the power to initiate a reform of the Electoral Act, and therefore we have to do so. We also have to do so because, soon, the MEP seats in Parliament will be redistributed with the entry of Croatia. Therefore, the report by Mr Duff, whom I want to congratulate for the work he has done, is included in this field. The Electoral Act, as you know, dates back to 1976. A great deal of time has elapsed since then, and we therefore need to improve it. The debate taking place today is likely to focus on the pan-European list, and I say pan-European because my group has tabled an amendment along these lines that we will uphold, with all the more reason today, in honour of the recently deceased Archduke Otto von Habsburg, who used the term ‘Pan-Europe’. The pan-European list appears to raise serious doubts. Some people are telling us, ‘It is too soon.’ However, I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, that on 8 May 1950, an advisor told Chancellor Adenauer or Mr Schuman, ‘Minister, Chancellor, it is too early to make a Franco-German agreement to pool coal and steel.’ For conservatives, everything is always too soon. For those who want nothing to change, it is always too soon. For those of us in favour of progress, those who want Europe to move forward, we want to have high hopes, Madam President. One of William Faulkner’s characters said, in a very glorious way, ‘Our dreams must be like mountains so that, wherever we are, we can see them and pursue them.’ The transnational, pan-European list fits into this idea of dreams, ideals, poetry and struggle. Madam President, the style of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is to have the greatest possible consensus. We will seek the consensus needed to introduce it here. Nevertheless, as Paul Valéry said about every poem, ‘It is never finished; only abandoned.’ Today we are abandoning it, but we will come back to it, Madam President. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 – Madam President, Mr Kožušník, who is no longer here, said of my speech that I was in the mountains. Maybe, but I prefer to be in the mountains than to be in the past.  (FR)
 My colleague, Mrs Auconie, and Mr Kožušník, expressed how hard it is to explain to their constituents why we are dealing with institutional matters rather than real-life issues. It was a Frenchman, Jean Monnet, who explained that politics needs institutions. Commissioner, before this debate, we held another debate today on the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union. Let me tell you that with a little intelligence and ingenuity, anything is possible. At the end of the day, in response to the argument that the transnational European list would disadvantage the smaller States, we need to remember that the Presidents of the Commission have included Gaston Thorn and Jacques Santer. Mr Juncker is the President of the Euro Group. Are they from large countries? Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Mr President, when I first entered this House 20 years ago, this debate would not have taken place, because this House was a consultative parliament at the time, and many of us have battled over the last 20 years to make it what it is today, a co-legislator parliament. However, when one co-legislates, one must be responsible. It is an exercise in responsibility that is now in need. A part of this House has adopted the old May 1968 slogan, according to which it is realistic to demand the impossible. Obviously, if one demands the impossible, it ultimately becomes impossible to agree on anything. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has not negotiated with any individual groups. We have negotiated with all the groups. However, we have only reached agreements with those that were ready to do so. Mr President, it is my belief that much progress has undeniably been made with the Commission’s proposal, the Council’s position and what is now on the table – which will be put to the vote tomorrow – if they are examined objectively. This is the real controversy or dilemma that we will have to resolve tomorrow. At the end of his fruitful existence, Miguel de Cervantes said that there were moments in life when one must choose whether to be a road or an inn. By being an inn, Cervantes meant lying still, complaining that one is ignored and remaining static. Being a road means moving forward, overcoming obstacles, knowing that not all has been achieved, that the road is probably not the one we would like to be walking on, but going on walking all the same. This is what I believe this House should do tomorrow: walk on, resolve the differences we still have with the Council, but look towards a time when the crisis is hitting all Europeans. It is not responsible at this juncture to say ‘I am not happy with this, goodbye, have a nice day’. Responsibility means walking. Therefore, Mr President, I think that in tomorrow’s vote we will convene another meeting with the Council to be held in July. As another poet used to say – Mr Sosa Wagner has quoted a German poet, I will quote a French one, Paul Valéry – poems are never finished, they are simply abandoned. We will abandon the end result until July, and I hope that the Hungarian Presidency, which has proved so successful, will also be able to reach an agreement that satisfies everyone. Thank you, Mr President, and may I point out that this is the first time in 20 years that the clock has erred in my favour, giving me more time. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Mr President, we will not be going ahead with the vote on the Brok-Gualtieri report this morning: we will do it during the Brussels sitting. We will do it then in order to give Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri time to negotiate the conditions for applying Article 136 with the European Council. We are doing so because, as Mr Leinen said, the European Parliament is also der Hüter der Verträge
 – the guardian of the Treaties – and because we want the euro to function with everyone involved and with everyone committed; in the end, Mr President, we want it to be effective. That is what we asked for. It is not about any dispute between the institutions. It is not about gaining power for Parliament. It is about the result – the mechanism resulting from this – being effective for the European public. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,

Madam President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is going to vote enthusiastically in favour of this report, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council on this agreement. Ladies and gentlemen, in the 1980s we coined the phrase ‘democratic deficit’. By this we meant that in the European Union decisions were taken only by the Council of Ministers, based on Commission proposals, and that Parliament was only consulted. Parliament has been battling since the 1980s, through the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, the Constitutional Treaty and the Treaty of Lisbon, to close that democratic deficit, and I believe that through the Treaty of Lisbon, with Parliament’s new powers and the participation of national parliaments, we have achieved that objective. We are adding to that achievement today through this citizens’ initiative, which in the work of the Convention was due to the sound cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament. I would like to recall the following names here today: Jürgen Meyer, our German Social Democrat colleague, and Alain Lamassoure, who were responsible for bringing this initiative to the plenary of the Convention and getting it approved. I therefore believe that we have completed the circle, Madam President. I believe that today, when we adopt this initiative, we will have signed the death warrant of the idea of a ‘democratic deficit’. Now it is up to us to act responsibly, ladies and gentlemen, and today we also have the opportunity to do so. By adopting the Union budget we will be fulfilling the role that is expected of us: as a responsible Parliament with codecision powers. Ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is a good day for Europe. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,

Madam President, I joined Parliament 18 years ago now. Then, the European Parliament was a consultative parliament. It was a parliament that did not have any powers. In this process over the past 18 years, we have seen Parliament change from a consultative parliament to a fully colegislative one. Our good friend, Francisco Lucas Pires, who witnessed this process, said that it changed from a deliberative parliament to a legislative parliament. Therefore, the text that we are going to adopt on Wednesday is the culmination of negotiations between the Commission and Parliament on the framework agreement. I confess that when I tell my family that I am going to Strasbourg to take part in the debate on the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission, I have to give them quite a lengthy explanation. This is because, obviously, these things do not exist in national parliaments or at national level, so people do not understand why an agreement has to be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to implement what the treaties say. However, it does have to be done. It has to be done for a very basic reason, which Mr Rangel and Mr Šefčovič have already stated: because we want to be efficient. What the framework agreement is essentially seeking to do is to resolve all the practical obstacles that could arise in terms of legislation, parliamentary control and codes of conduct. I therefore believe that it is a good blend of European democracy. It is ‘consensual’ democracy rather than the ‘conflictive’ democracy that we have in our countries. In consensual democracy, the intelligent thing to do is to find solutions to any problems that could arise. Therefore, the framework agreement is an instrument for preventing future problems and making what the treaties say a reality. As we have a new treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, it makes sense to implement it. I would like to congratulate Mr Rangel and the team that he led, and the European Commission, because I believe that they have reached a very reasonable agreement. When reading the content of the agreement, one cannot fail to be surprised at the voices being heard in some national parliaments questioning whether it poses a threat to the Council’s powers. For goodness’ sake! The Council is indeed the other colegislator. We do want to legislate, and we are legislating a great deal and successfully with the Council of Ministers. We are colegislators on an equal footing. We do not need to gain any sort of small advantage. What we want is for this to be effective, and I believe that the agreement is going to help to achieve this. Allow me to say, Mr Šefčovič, that you took the bull by the horns – a very bullfighting-related expression in my country – when you said that the interpretation of Articles 6 and 7 of the resolution is Parliament’s interpretation in relation to international agreements and international conferences. I do not believe there is anything strange here. What we are talking about here is Parliament being informed and participating through the Commission and through negotiation, nothing more. What is the purpose? The purpose is for us to know what the Commission has done when we have to adopt it here. Therefore – and I will finish here Madam President – congratulations to both of you. I believe that this is a good omen: as they would say in Casablanca, 
‘the beginning of a beautiful friendship’. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, on 14 February 2008, as a Valentine’s gift, the Conference of Presidents decided that the intergroups would only meet on Thursdays. Since then, we have been trying to resolve this issue. We have not managed to do so. Now the intergroups have to meet on an unsuitable date. They almost never have rooms and they never have interpretation. I am speaking today not only as the Chair of the Intergroup on Poverty and Human Rights, but with a mandate from the majority of the intergroups in this House, and therefore from the Members of this House who are part of those intergroups. I formally ask the Conference of Presidents to reconsider and to revoke the decision of 14 February 2008, going back to the previous situation of giving freedom to the intergroups. If it does not do so, I would like to say respectfully that we will bring the matter to Parliament’s plenary session, which will decide who is sovereign in this House, which is Parliament. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, Mr Leterme, I would congratulate you on your speech: it was an excellent presentation of this Presidency. I believe that we can already draw one, or even more than one, conclusion from this morning’s debate: firstly, that this House – those of us who want to build Europe, those of us who want to think positively about Europe – supports your Presidency and supports the efforts that you will be making. Furthermore, being aware of the difficulties within your government, I would like to thank you doubly, as it is all the more difficult for you to have come here today with this ambitious programme. We offer you our heartfelt thanks. Secondly, concentrate on resolving the economic issues. I believe that we have a great opportunity at the moment. I believe that we are on the point of reaching agreement on the issues relating to financial supervision. Concentrate on that. Thirdly, make the Trio work. I believe that the Trio of Presidencies is the great innovation of the Treaty of Lisbon. Let it not be a gimmick, let it be a reality, and let us do what the founding fathers said: think and act – in this case, Spaniards, Belgians and Hungarians – as Europeans. Thank you very much, Mr Leterme, and good luck! Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.

 Madam President, I believe that there can only be two solutions for resolving the financial crisis that we have experienced: either we give more powers to national supervisors, or we create a European supervisor and give powers to it. I am glad, Madam President, that at this moment, Parliament is firmly committed, politically committed, to European supervision, and I believe that there is great consensus on this among all political groupings. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs will support, and has supported, all institutional measures that move in this direction. It seems to me at the moment, Madam President, that once this commitment becomes manifest tomorrow, the Commission has a first order function in negotiations with the Council. During these negotiations, it seems to me that the key point will be whether these European authorities will be able to deal with companies affected directly at national level if the national supervisor is not involved. Therefore, Commissioner, the best of luck with this task, which I believe to be a determining factor for the future of supervision and capital, at this time, for those of us who would like more Europe. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, when you attended a meeting of the European Economic and Social Committee, Mr Van Rompuy, you used a beautiful image. You said that in the economic and financial crisis, we had wanted to build life rafts during the voyage. This was indeed the case, as the Economic and Financial Affairs Council that preceded the last European Council meeting took certain measures that were unthinkable in some countries, one of which I know very well. What we therefore need to do is ensure that this does not happen again in the future and therefore, that we build the life rafts in advance. I listened very carefully to what you said. You mentioned ‘a strict supervision of the national budgets’. I agree. Then, however, you added that there was no question whatsoever of the Commission supervising the national budgets before they were approved by the national parliaments. Well, I heard you say this to Commissioner Rehn. Moreover, I think it is a good idea and one that we should explore. ‘De l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace
’, as a French revolutionary would say. I have no problem at all, President Van Rompuy, with being under the protection of the European Union. I prefer to be under the protection of the European Union than under the protection of rulers whose method of government involves constantly changing course and improvising. We are therefore going to pursue any possibilities that we have. Secondly, it has been said here by some Members that as they are not in the euro, they do not care what happens to the euro. Well, I am concerned about what happens to the national currencies that are not in the euro, because that is being European. If, at any point, those currencies are in difficulties, it will concern me, because they will affect the economy that belongs to all of us. Mr President, one last aside. I know that, in times of crisis, it is more difficult to talk about fighting poverty, because there are fewer resources. I believe, however, that what has made us greater as Europeans is fighting against social exclusion and poverty. I ask that 2010, which is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, should not be simply one more conclusion of the European Council. President of the Commission, let us make active policies in this area. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

 Madam President, more than 20 years ago – in fact 23 years ago – I was fortunate enough to witness the signing of an agreement in the other parliament building between the then President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, and the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Marcelino Oreja, for what were then the European Communities to sign up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. That was 23 years ago. This reminds me of the answer that the poet Heinrich Heine gave when he was asked, ‘Where would you like to die?’ He replied, ‘In England, because there everything happens 100 years later’. Based on some speeches that we have heard, it seems that everything happens 200 years later, Madam President. I trust, however, that Mr Duff’s influence in the new Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition government will improve this situation. Therefore, Madam President, my Group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), has been in favour of this accession for a long time now, and we warmly welcome the excellent report by Mr Jáuregui. It is his first report and I am sure that it will not be his last. We are doing so because we feel that it will increase guarantees for the public, because what we are doing is giving more guarantees to people that the European Union legislation applied by the Member States and European Union laws is in line with the set of rights recognised in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights. This report opens the way for resolving many of the technical legal problems that are going to arise, because we must not forget that the convention was designed to be ratified and applied by Member States. Whatever the propaganda from some sides of this House, the European Union is not a state or a super-state. It is an international organisation, and therefore, there are difficulties in adjusting an international organisation to something that was made for states. Mrs Giannakou, who was our shadow rapporteur and did an excellent job for which I sincerely thank her, will talk about the specific issues. All I want to do now is join Vice-President Reding in calling for the Council to give the Commission a mandate to negotiate swiftly, and I am sure that my friend, Mr López Garrido, will ensure that this is the case. This will mean, Madam President, that soon we will be able to celebrate the European Union signing up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Madam President, I would like to clarify two things. Firstly, the articles that are in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that are also in the European Convention on Human Rights are the same and mean the same thing: Articles 52 and 53 of the Charter; there is therefore no contradiction. Secondly, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights is supranational. Therefore, if someone wants to apply to it due to a European Union decision or the application of Union law, they will first have to apply to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling. I understand that Europhobes always want to vote against Europe, but at least out of parliamentary courtesy, they should read Mr Jáuregui’s report, which sets everything out clearly. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, please allow me to begin my speech with a line from Rilke: ‘Herr, es ist Zeit. Der Sommer war sehr groß...
’.
 Rilke was the favourite poet of our recently deceased fellow Member, Dimitris Tsatsos. Some time ago now, on 19 November 1997, Dimitris Tsatsos and I had the honour of submitting the report on the Treaty of Amsterdam to this House. It was in that very report on the Treaty of Amsterdam that we proposed that any amendment to Treaties be prepared beforehand by a Convention. We called that the Community method. Indeed, it is that Convention method that was used in preparing the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, above all, the Constitutional Treaty. I wish to remember Dimitris Tsatsos today in particular, as we are on the threshold of carrying out the first reform of the Treaty of Lisbon, which, in the last analysis, Mr President, is the Constitutional Treaty for which we fought so hard. That first reform, which is going to consist of the amendment of Protocol (No 36) of the Treaty of Lisbon, is caused by an anomaly because, at the time the elections to this Parliament were held in June last year, the Treaty of Lisbon had not come into force owing to the vicissitudes with which we are all familiar. Consequently, the last parliamentary elections were held under the Treaty of Nice, which was in force at that time, and said Treaty of Nice provides for the existence of 736 MEPs, as opposed to the 751 provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. To complicate matters even further, Mr President, the 1976 Act lays down that an MEP’s mandate lasts for five years. This means that we cannot now simply apply the number laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely the 751 MEPs, given that under Lisbon a certain country loses three Members who have been elected and, therefore, cannot leave Parliament during this parliamentary term. That, Mr President, is why Protocol (No 36) has to be amended in order to enable the Lisbon agreements to come into force, and why during this parliamentary term, 2009-2014, when the amendment of Protocol (No 36) comes into force, this Parliament will, exceptionally, have 754 Members. That is why, Mr President, the European Council addressed a letter to you asking that, in accordance with Article 48(2) of the Treaty, this Parliament give its opinion on two questions. The first question is whether or not a Convention is necessary in order to prepare the amendment to Protocol (No 36). The second is whether or not the Heads of State or Government can call an Intergovernmental Conference to amend Protocol (No 36). Both questions are linked, although they are dealt with in two different reports. I will begin with the calling of an Intergovernmental Conference. As I have said, we are dealing with the political result of applying the Treaty of Lisbon and we are also dealing with a transitional and exceptional solution that will only last for the duration of this parliamentary term. Therefore, that Intergovernmental Conference will confine itself to something that has already been agreed: how to distribute those 18 MEPs among 12 countries. Consequently, Mr President, there is no debate. I believe that the Intergovernmental Conference can be very quickly called and can even resolve the issue in a single morning, given that the political decision has already been taken. For that reason, I am going to ask for a ‘yes’ vote for an Intergovernmental Conference and say that I do not believe that a Convention is required for an issue that has already been resolved. We are in favour of holding the Intergovernmental Conference; we are against calling a Convention. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, when people coming from positions as different and far-removed as those of Mr Mauro, Mr Gollnisch and Mr Colman come to the conclusion that there are problems with the electoral procedure and systems for the election of MEPs to the European Parliament, it means that we need a uniform electoral procedure. That was a mandate that already existed in the Treaties of Rome. Therefore, we coordinators – and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them, most especially Mr Jáuregui and Mr Duff – have agreed on Amendment 2, which will be voted on tomorrow. I hope that this amendment will be supported by this House, particularly so that we can soon resolve this issue of a uniform electoral procedure for elections to the European Parliament. By means of this, we would, it seems to me, remove this type of question mark. In his speech, Mr Trzaskowski spoke about the necessary representativeness of this Parliament, something that the majority of the speakers and Vice-President Šefčovič, among others, have also highlighted. I agree. Indeed, we say as much in paragraph 1 of the report, to the extent that the 18 MEPs should enter en bloc
, otherwise we would lose representativeness. In order for them to enter en bloc
, in order to comply with this act of political justice that is the Treaty of Lisbon, we have to be practical, because a transitional and exceptional situation, ladies and gentlemen, also requires transitional and exceptional situations and solutions. This is why, and I am quite open about it, I do not like the possibility of MEPs joining this Parliament who were not elected in 2009, something which, by the way, I clearly state in paragraph 2 of the report. Nevertheless, if I have to choose between that and the 18 Members not taking their seats, or coming up with a practical solution and the 18 joining, meaning therefore that we comply with the Treaty of Lisbon, I ask this House, as I have already done in the report, to choose that solution; a transitional and pragmatic one but, above all, Madam President, a just one. I would like to thank everyone for their collaboration and for the interesting contributions that were made to this report. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, it was in this very House, almost seven years ago, at the end of the constitutional convention, when we Members of the European Parliament and members of the national parliaments succeeded in putting forward a proposal that was accepted by the Presidium. I had the honour of taking it to the Presidium and we approved it. Furthermore, I wish to recall here the names of Mr Lamassoure and Mr Mayer, because it was they who drew up the Citizens’ Initiative proposal, a popular initiative that is today incorporated into the treaties. A popular initiative that is an example of participatory democracy – Mr Šefčovič has explained this very well – and of European democracy, because the issues that need to be covered by this initiative must be European issues, not local issues. Participation by citizens, therefore, and issues dealt with at European level. Mr Šefčovič, who is preparing this proposal, has not told us what it involves. He has left us with our mouths watering. On behalf of my group, Mr Šefčovič, I would ask that it contain at least three ideas. Firstly, that it should be clear and simple. In other words, do not let us make things complicated. It must be something accessible to the people, so that they can participate without having had to have gone to university. Secondly, that it should provide for cooperation between the European authorities and the national authorities, because, in my opinion, the national authorities must play an important role in the way signatures are organised. Thirdly, that we should educate, through the European Commission and through Parliament, by explaining how this legislative initiative may be used to avoid disappointments. I will give you an example of this that I saw on the Internet. An online petition has already been launched to use the popular initiative to make it possible to change the seat of Parliament so that there is only one. Well, this is impossible and we must say so from the start; it calls for reform in the treaties and cannot be dealt with by the popular initiative. There is, therefore, a lot of educating to be done, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, and of Parliament, in an initiative that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) endorses and hopes may serve to promote the sense of belonging to the Union and public participation in the Union’s business. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, I had the same concern as that expressed by the rapporteur. I think that in order for the vote to proceed properly on Wednesday, in the case of such an important report, we need to know in advance which amendments you consider to be inadmissible. I therefore accept what you said, and we would like to have them tomorrow. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would like to return to the subject of the admissibility of amendments, which you referred to before. Pursuant to Rule 157(3), it is up to you, but I would ask you, Mr President, to take into account the wise words of the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Casini. I do not think it can be left in the hands of the Parliament’s services to determine which amendments relate to the Treaty of Lisbon and which do not. Moreover, this House has the sovereign right to decide whether or not an amendment is necessary, at this time when, as everyone has said, a new phase is beginning. Mr President, I would ask you, therefore, to use the considerable power granted to you under the Rules of Procedure in moderation, and with your usual prudence. May you make the right decision, and may we all see it. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, the President of the European Commission was saying that he congratulated Mr Reinfeldt on having brought the ship safely to harbour, the ship in question being the Treaty of Lisbon. Two years ago, in this House, I was saying that I was afraid that the Treaty of Lisbon might end up like the fish in The Old Man and the Sea,
 Hemingway’s novella, which, after a long battle, arrived at the harbour almost as a pile of bones. Well, I can see that the Treaty of Lisbon has not arrived at harbour as a pile of bones, but that its essence is still there. Thank you, Mr Reinfeldt; thank you, Cecilia. I must say, however, that I believe that what you have done, in seeking the agreement with the President of the Czech Republic, is right. Many of us in this House were troubled by the behaviour of the President of the Czech Republic, but there is a Spanish poet who says: ‘after everything, everything has been nothing’; in the end, the important thing is that the treaty is in force and that now we are thinking about the implementation of the treaty. Mr Barroso, it is not my intention either to give you any advice on how you ought to form your Commission, partly because I respect the autonomy and independence of the President of the Commission, who has received a substantial vote asking him to do this. When you present your college of Commissioners and the division of responsibilities, we will tell you whether we are for or against, but today, you have our full support. Neither do I intend to give any advice, clearly, to the President-in-Office of the Council, but, if you will permit me, I would like to point out to you something that happened during the work done on the constitutional treaty. In the first draft, which created the post of the President of the Council, there was a proposal that this Council President should be a prime minister who had been in office for at least two and a half years (as a joke, Mr Reinfeldt, we called it the ‘Bruton clause’, after John Bruton, because John told us that he had been prime minister for two years and seven months, and therefore would be eligible for the post). However, we later removed this condition – Mr Duff remembers – and we removed it because in this Parliament, we were asked what there was in the DNA of a prime minister that was not possessed by other mortals’ DNA. Why must the President of the Council be a prime minister? Mr Reinfeldt, you should rather seek out the person who can best represent moral authority, who can be the broker of agreements in Europe. In order to do this, we have given you a tool, Mr Reinfeldt: it is the fact that the election of this President of the Council does not have to be unanimous, but may be by qualified majority. Therefore, consensus is desirable, if it is possible; if not, use the qualified majority to seek out the best President of the Council. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE
).  
– Mr President, because the speaker was so kind as to agree to answer a question, I am going to ask one. Real Madrid, which is a Spanish football club, has got a flag and an anthem. Do you believe it is a state? (Laughter and applause) Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us imagine that tonight, when this interminable debate finishes, we go out and we meet 27 fellow Members downstairs and we have to decide unanimously which restaurant we are going to. If we negotiate this obstacle, then imagine that the 27 of us have to choose the same thing to eat, and that the 27 of us also have to decide whether or not to have wine. Mr President, this metaphor, which comes from someone who is on a diet, provides a good illustration of the current situation of the European Union and what the Treaty of Lisbon brings in: in my view, it is the most important thing, namely eliminating the requirement for unanimity. If those of us who have spoken here all want the European Union to function properly, to be effective, to produce added value for the people, then the first thing that needs to be done is to replace the requirement for unanimity with a requirement for super-qualified majorities. That is the most significant achievement of the Treaty of Lisbon. Opposing the Treaty of Lisbon means not wanting Europe to function properly or to have an important role in the world. Mr President, I do not understand, and it is a source of regret for me, how some fellow Members who have freely entered this Parliament can have more confidence in the Council of Ministers than in the European Parliament. In addition, these are people who will never be in the Council of Ministers. Why do they believe that their interests are better defended by the Council of Ministers than by this Parliament, where they are present and where they can vote? Mr President, another thing I do not understand is why a certain fellow Member said that what they want is to take their country – and this is a legitimate view – out of the European Union. In that case, ladies and gentlemen, it is necessary to be in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon, because the Treaty of Lisbon establishes, for the first time, an exit clause. Now, in truth, it is necessary to have the courage and the ambition to say to their people that it is necessary to leave the European Union. That is also something that I would like to see. Mr President, to sum up, I believe that through the result of the Irish referendum we are completing the process. Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Rouček and Mr Brok – who are concerned by the attitude of the President of the Czech Republic – that I have no doubts. I have no doubts because a person who refused to sign what had been adopted by the Chambers that elected him, a person who refused to sign the Treaty, would be like the Queen of England refusing to sign a law from Westminster. That is not possible. I am also certain that someone as patriotic as Mr Klaus would not want to see his country engulfed in an internal constitutional crisis. Mr President, I therefore believe that the time has come to join forces, for us to realise that the world is not waiting for us, the Europeans, and that either we Europeans must unite and maintain constructive positions regarding the problems that our citizens are experiencing at the moment, or else Europe, as a power, will disappear from the map. Mr President, that is what I believe that we must now do, in unity, as Europeans and as Parliament. Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE

Mr President, I believe that one of the conclusions of this debate is that when things are explained, when there is discussion with people, when there is communication, when lies are denied, then greater participation and greater backing for the European project are achieved. Therefore, I venture, along the lines of what many speakers have said, to make a positive, constructive contribution, and to ask the European Commission to consider whether, in the make-up of the new Commission, the duties of the Commissioner for Human Rights should not be included within a wider portfolio such as the Commissioner for Citizenship, to include communication, which is vitally necessary in order to be able to communicate well, to explain well, and to be able to begin a genuine dialogue on our European project.

 Mr President, the seriousness of the situation undoubtedly means that the forthcoming European Council to be held on 28 and 29 June will be perceived differently by Europeans, as a starting point in the efforts to build a new structure for the European Union. It cannot therefore simply involve the proposed freezing of a series of measures and initiatives that people do not understand. Instead, we need to be able to find sufficient symbols and unequivocal signs in this Council that a new era is dawning in the European Union. A plan needs to be decided upon, with a timetable and priorities, and, above all, short-term measures need to be as important as medium and long-term measures. We are all aware of the areas where action needs to be taken. The Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, has recently sent the President of the Council and the President of the Commission an action plan with five measures. What we wish to highlight, however, is the need for a new European structure that can bring an end to the instability and turbulence that we are currently experiencing. Jaime Mayor Oreja,

 Mr President, I shall not waste too much time describing the decision and procedures undertaken by the Argentine Government in its expropriation of YPF-Repsol. As I said yesterday, however, arbitrariness, legal uncertainty and illegitimacy are some of the terms that this decision merits. We are therefore facing a violation of rights and principles, appalling political and economic practice, and a worrying precedent, which means that this incident affects all Europeans. This is not, therefore, a dispute merely between Spain and Argentina. That is why today, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to stress what Europeans – the European institutions – can do, as well as why, what for and how, when this kind of decision is taken, which weakens the principles and, undoubtedly, the freedoms I have just mentioned, with the aim being that this type of action is never repeated. Allow me to express two ideas. The first is that in times and situations of crisis such as we are currently experiencing, the weaknesses of everyone, national governments and national institutions of the different countries, both inside and outside the EU, tend to increase; this is a reminder that the EU’s strength is its reason for being, and that the best instrument with which to alleviate the difficulties and weaknesses of the Member States should be the Union’s strength. That is the EU’s main purpose. My second idea is this: the crisis involves us all and is present in every European country; although it might appear momentarily that it is settling in one country or another, it is, in fact, our very model that is in crisis and, if it is not resolved, that crisis spreads slowly, gradually and systematically throughout all the countries. That is why one of the deep-rooted causes of this crisis is the EU’s lack of political ambition, and therefore the different manifestations of the crisis at hand should serve as opportunities so that the European voice can be clearly heard when this kind of injustice endangers the investments and future of the European institutions. I therefore welcome the determination shown by Mr Wammen, Mr Tajani, Baroness Ashton and Mr Barroso, who have proven that they are examining measures with which to tackle this situation. The more planned, strategic and organised measures we adopt, the greater and better our response will be to this crisis.

 Mr President, the climate crisis cannot be used as an argument to cover up an injustice of this kind. The fact that we are experiencing harmful climate change should in no way allow us to hide the injustices, arbitrariness and legal uncertainties that are taking place in a country such as Argentina. One day, we shall have the debate you want on climate change and – you are not really listening to me – on the crisis of values and principles that we are having in the EU and European countries. We can talk about climate change and the crisis of values whenever you like, but today we must address an injustice that is being carried out in Argentina, which is damaging European prospects and investments in the countries of that region. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, there is one principle that we should defend both inside and outside the European Union, and that is the principle of legal certainty. Arbitrariness is an aspect of this that we should be able to face up to and fight against, both inside and outside the European Union. When a decision is dominated by legal uncertainty and arbitrariness, that constitutes an unlawful action which affects thousands of small shareholders and which, most of all, sets a bad precedent for many European investments around the world. We therefore maintain that this debate is necessary and essential, not only for Spain and for a Spanish company, but also as a future reference for the many European investments made outside our borders. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE

 Madam President, the European Council has adopted a series of measures covering governance, budgetary rationalisation, competitiveness and so on and I must say that they are all along the right lines. The European Council’s 16 points are largely due to the work of President Van Rompuy and President Barroso, to whom I first of all offer my congratulations, because I do value – some of us do value – what you have done as leaders of the institutions. However, the problem is that not only are we going through a financial crisis, we are also experiencing a crisis of confidence and a political crisis in Europe and in the European nations. The problem is not simply one of assessing the actual economic and technical contents of the European Council. At the same time as there are meetings of the European Council, European, national and regional elections are being held and all of these confirm our apprehensions. Extreme positions are being adopted. Some of these positions are currently taking refuge in forms of nationalism. Therefore, you must be very well aware that our problem is not simply to face up to the crisis, but to face up to the political and social consequences of that crisis. It is not simply a time when there is, as a fellow Member quite rightly said, a north-south crisis in the European Union. These are new times and a particular feature of new times is that crises mount up and proliferate and are not resolved. They turn up unexpectedly, both inside and outside the EU. Moreover, these new times basically demand new ways of thinking at both individual and institutional levels, and that is the major political challenge that faces us. Any change in one’s personal way of thinking starts with that person him or herself. First of all, if that person is a Member of this House, he or she must say in what ways Parliament must change if it is to deal with new times. The same goes for members of the Commission and the Council; each and every one of us must be able to face up to this issue. However, in any case, the main thing is not to go off course, because you are heading in the right direction. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE

Mr President, the attacks that have recently taken place in Iraq and Egypt are evidence of two tragedies for Europe, albeit of a different nature. Firstly, it is a tragedy that the events themselves have taken place, due to their cruelty and the loss of human life. Secondly, however, it is also a tragedy to see how too often they go unnoticed in our society. In many cases, the way in which we act means that these events are confined to the accident and crime reports in the media, as if they were something external rather than an attack against us. It is as if they were happening somewhere else when, in fact, these attacks are taking place at the heart of and against the core of our civilisation, our Europe. The role of the European institutions is, fundamentally, to raise awareness regarding the seriousness, the significance and the scope of the attacks against Christians in these places. The European institutions should not only issue generic statements condemning these attacks, but should also promote action along two lines: firstly, ensuring that this tragedy is more present in our societies and our media, and secondly, ensuring that the European institutions are more present where the tragedy is taking place. With this objective and with these two lines of action, allow me to say, Baroness Ashton, that the European institutions and you yourself must promote the important role of the victims of these events. The victims need to be given faces. The victims need to be present in our European institutions. We need to prepare a programme of visits, meetings and even material support for the victims, but it is the victims of this terrible persecution themselves who will do much better than we can to defend their cause.

Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, these first six months following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon required and merited a change in political attitude. If the economic and financial crisis has been a consequence of the move away from the ‘real’ economy and the disordered development of the ‘unreal’ economy, the same can be said in a political context. On 20 January, in this Parliament, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero announced the four – not two – priorities of his Presidency: first, the common market for energy; second, investment in the information society; third, a sustainable economy or industry, with a plan for developing an electric vehicle; fourth, the completion of the Bologna higher education area. I ask myself, to what extent does this statement of objectives approach the reality that we have lived through? During his first speech, when he put forward his objectives, he did not mention the words ‘deficit’ or ‘debt’ once. The entire Presidency changed radically at the Ecofin meeting on 9 and 10 May of this year, and the euro crisis came to light. He continued to be late and unsuccessful. Necessary measures had to be improvised in the European Union due to the lack of foresight and depth in the diagnosis of the crisis. There was an additional difficulty: because of the results of his economic policy, the person holding the rotating Presidency was not in a position to participate in the leadership required for a solution, as he had become part of the problem. While rotating presidencies are, without a doubt, different following the treaty, in such an acute situation of economic crisis, either they assert themselves, or else they are even more limited and weighed down by the lack of confidence in, and the lack of credibility of, their economic policies within their respective countries, as in this case. Mr President, the greatest crisis that we politicians are living through is that of confidence. A crisis of confidence of such magnitude can only be resolved if we dare to tell the truth. We can find a description of the third fiction of this Presidency within this morning’s speech, in which it seemed that the President was only interested in extolling this Presidency. The question that we must ask ourselves is whether we will be capable of not going back to improvising or, instead, whether we will be able to diagnose and foresee the specific crisis scenario that will have a social dimension. (Applause) Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

Mr President, I believe that the worst crisis that we could suffer is not only the one that we are currently suffering, but the one that we will suffer if we are not capable of learning the right political lessons regarding what is happening. We have been living beyond our means, especially in some countries. We have moved away from the real economy and embraced the fictional economy, in our public accounts and, at the same time, in our family and private lives. We have not been capable of understanding that, as is the case for any living organism, growing is not the same thing as getting fat. Growth requires effort and proportion, while the process of getting fat involves a lack of proportion and balance in comparison with the work that we do and the welfare that we enjoy. This crisis does not remain static. The picture of the crisis a few months ago was a different one, a completely different one, to the picture that we have today. The picture of the crisis in a few months is going to be a different one to the picture that we have today. This crisis was economic and financial, and will have a growing social dimension involving social conflict. This means that while we are in this phase, before the conflict becomes a social one, those of us involved in politics need to be aware that our main crisis is a crisis of confidence. It is not only a crisis of the euro. Let us analyse all the political and electoral processes in recent months. There is a crisis of confidence, and that means that what we need to ask ourselves is how we need to change, how our attitude needs to change: our political, institutional and personal attitude. In this respect, instead of thinking about other institutions, the question that Parliament needs to ask itself is what contribution it can make to a change of institutional and political attitude in this House. I dare say that today, having heard many reasons for the crisis – bureaucracy, agencies, governments – there are two issues on which we need to change. Firstly, Europe requires a minimum level of cohesion from Parliament: it cannot bleed itself dry in such a profound debate on two concepts of European society. Secondly, we need to dare to tell the truth about what is happening to us. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to express my wholehearted, firm and unreserved support to Mr Barroso. This is based not only on what he has said today, but also on speeches he has made in Parliament that have encouraged us to support him more strongly and significantly than ever. I would like to say that the main reason for that support is not the number of Commissioners that our Group, or our political family, has in the Commission, but rather it is fundamentally the belief that this is a unique and distinct time for the European Union. This Commission is not just any Commission and this Parliament is not just any Parliament, not only because of the Treaty of Lisbon, but also because we are experiencing a crisis that is unprecedented in the European Union: an economic and social crisis. We do not think that the Treaty of Lisbon is the most important thing. The most important thing is for there to be a change of attitude in terms of steering all the European institutions towards greater political ambition. We therefore unreservedly support the Commission led by Mr Barroso. We also support the Commission because, whilst we are currently experiencing an economic and financial crisis, we are going to move onto another phase: the social crisis. The differences between some countries and others are going to increase, and there is going to be increased social unrest. The economic and social crisis is undoubtedly going to cause increased social unrest. Another reason is that we are experiencing a crisis of values, making it essential that all of us, not just the Commission, change our personal attitudes. We all need to change our attitude. Our Group therefore believes that the best way to change, to transform and to improve is to support the European Commission led by Mr Barroso. I therefore think that in the context of this task, and of the work that we have to do, the PPE Group is the group that wants us all to change the most. The European Parliament also needs to change. The Commission alone cannot be held responsible for the frequent lack of unity in this House, which is largely the reason why there is no European voice in the world. Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

Mr President of the Spanish Government, I would like to say to you that we are not living in just another period, we are not living in just any moment in and for the European Union. What you and Chair Daul said is true: the European Union and the European people know that their main concern is the crisis. It also needs to be pointed out here today, however, that before the economic crisis, in various elections in which there was a low turnout, Europeans were also showing signs of a growing disinterest and distance from the European institutions. Therefore, the crisis of values has manifested itself before and also during the European integration project. I want to say this to you because, in view of the obvious impetus which will be provided by the Treaty of Lisbon, we have our first opportunity to reduce this rift between the European people and the European institutions. We are therefore living – or at least we should be living – in a period of transition and of change, which you referred to. I would like to say, however, that the first challenge that we have ahead of us is to be able to find the turning point in the process of Europeans becoming distanced from European policy. Transitions are always an opportunity. They are also a risk, but I obviously encourage you to have a small number of clear ideas that can always be communicated to all Europeans. I would therefore like to say that a change in attitude in all the European institutions, in all of us and in the national governments and parliaments, in politicians, is undoubtedly much more important than the Treaty of Lisbon itself. It is not enough for the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force in order for us to be able to talk about transition and change in the European Union and ambition in the European project. I therefore want to say to you that the prime ambition is for Europeans to understand us better, as they do not understand us. Our language is unintelligible and, at times, incomprehensible, and we therefore have to know how to say that this is a problem in itself and a challenge in itself, so that we can move closer to the European people. We need to devote much more time, much more political energy and much more political impetus to ensuring that Europeans can understand us. Ladies and gentlemen, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, all the presidencies are going to be distinct, different and more demanding, and they are going to demand more sacrifice and more generosity from us than ever. I therefore would like to say that I am very pleased to say here today that the Spanish Partido Popular
 has supported the objectives of the Spanish Government in the European Presidency at such an important time for the European Union. What we need to do now is to apply them in the right way. I am going to tell you how the Spanish Presidency should not be measured. It is not going to be measured by the number of meetings that we hold. The measure of a good Presidency is not conventional speeches or great words, or common places. It will be measured by the results, the realities, our capacity to change our attitude – in all the European institutions – and our capacity to prioritise the real problems that Europeans have. This will be the only way that we will truly move closer to all Europeans. (Applause) Jaime Mayor Oreja  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commission President, I want to make a preliminary comment. We cannot have the same debate after elections as before elections, out of respect for the elections and for the European people. We should not do things any differently from what happens in the national parliaments in this respect. If the European Commissioners are the result of a majority in each country, our main concern should be that the Commission President is faithful to what the European people have voted for in the European elections, hence the importance and correctness of Mr Barroso becoming Commission President. This is a strictly democratic principle. There are two points which Mr Barroso made and which I do not have any doubts in clearly and definitively supporting. The first is the extent of the diagnosis of the current situation, which he gave in his speech and comments. We are not only experiencing an economic and financial crisis, but also a crisis of values. This is the first time that I have heard in this House any confirmation of these characteristics. We are not only experiencing a crisis, but also a changing world. That is why, more than ever before, the emphasis must be placed on positive action by individuals and on a change of attitude towards the State and the markets, because we have probably lived beyond our means in many EU countries. The second point, which I also support, is Mr Barroso’s European ambition. Europe needs to elect, prioritise and organise, and the crisis and the Treaty of Lisbon are the two main issues on which the Commission President must particularly concentrate. Tackling the crisis requires a determined Commission and also a Parliament which is capable of tackling the serious circumstances that we are experiencing. The crisis is not yet over and its landscape is still unrecognisable. It is also forcing us to deal with social inequalities in the European Union. We therefore need the political ambition that you have shown this afternoon, Mr Barroso. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again the horrific images from the Middle East have shaken us all. More than 35 children were among the 140 victims in the Gaza Strip; six people have been executed as alleged Israeli collaborators; a number of Israeli citizens have also killed by hundreds of rockets made in Iran; there has been an attack against civilians today in Tel Aviv; 45 000 reserve troops have been mobilised; and a ceasefire seems to have been confirmed, or so Mr Cohn-Bendit has just told me, after frantic diplomatic activity: mediation by the President of Egypt; phone calls by the President of the United States; visit to the region by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and US Secretary of State; involvement of the Arab League ministers; French-Qatari plan; and threat of a resolution on Syria in the United Nations Security Council. Of course, Mr President, in this case words are not enough as the situation is so serious. There is a great deal of impotence and frustration after the trite condemnation of the Council of Ministers the day before yesterday, and I believe that the most important thing is to achieve, and consolidate, a ceasefire that is guaranteed by the United Nations, and that protects the civilian population and supports the moderates. We saw the alternative, Mr President, in 2008: 1 400 victims. We are only too aware that the circumstances are not the best: fragmentation and division within the Palestinian cause, elections in Israel in January and, of course, a nuclear escalation in Iran. Therefore, President-in-Office of the Council, what Europe must do is support unreservedly this ceasefire to prevent the worst from happening. However, we must not fool ourselves, Mr President, into thinking that there can be stability in the area, stability in the region, unless we tackle the deep-seated causes and injustices that are fuelling the hatred and violence in that troubled part of the Middle East. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, when the negotiating guidelines were adopted, the European Union – its 27 Member States, the Commission and this Parliament – had a commitment from Israel dating back to 2005.  Israel is a partner of the European Union and an essential participant in the peace process, even if we dislike the decisions that have been taken with regard to settlements and in spite of the fact that some of the decisions taken by the Israeli Government undeniably violate the rights of the Palestinian people.  After the elections in the United States, the peace process negotiations will be revived, and it is clear that the European Union cannot be excluded from this process. The European Union and this Parliament therefore need to honour their commitments and adopt this agreement.  Mr President, the interpretative amendment that has been tabled to the draft legislative resolution is clearly in violation of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, as Rule 83 states quite clearly that no amendments may be tabled to a draft legislative resolution.  Parliament is entitled to express its opinion through non-legislative resolutions and, in any case, the acceptance of this amendment sets a worrying precedent, which, if this decision is not reversed, is likely to be the subject of an appeal before the Court of Justice, leaving those who tabled and accepted the amendment in a sticky situation. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
).  
– (ES)
 Mr President, I would like to make a clarification concerning the oral amendment presented by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Normally, my group strictly fulfils the commitments that it signs at the negotiating table, and the terms of negotiation, Mr President, state that the European Union will take appropriate and responsible measures. Clearly, included in those measures are humanitarian measures, as was reflected in the debate that we had with Baroness Ashton the other day, concerning the situation in Syria. Therefore, the addition of this word is superfluous because it is already included in the terms. Mr President, my group is opposed to the inclusion of this word. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Brok, on this report on the state of the common foreign and security policy, which cannot be separated from the times that the EU is living in with regard to the debt crisis, the euro crisis and the crisis in European integration. Baroness Ashton, as a bloc we may be the leading global importer of goods and services, we may be the leading global exporter of goods and services, and we may be the leading donor of humanitarian aid, tripling the aid donated by the United States, but what credibility do we have on the international stage, despite your efforts and our own, if we are not capable of solving internal problems with due care and in an effective manner? The new European External Action Service and the new common foreign and security policy have come into being at the most complex time and in the deepest crisis the EU has experienced since it was founded. It is clear that if we want to have a coherent, visible and effective common foreign and security policy, we need to try to answer the questions raised by Mr Brok in his introduction. How do we defend human rights in an international community that considers our Charter of Fundamental Rights to be a westernised view of the world? How do we reconcile the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, laid down in the United Nations Charter, with the principle of the responsibility to protect in order to prevent crises such as that in Syria, which you, Baroness Ashton, said appalled you? How do we identify new partners in line with our world view and how do we work with them, and how do we meet the challenges raised by the Northern and Southern Neighbourhood Policy? It is a difficult task, Baroness Ashton, to solve our external problems, and that is not your responsibility alone, as we will see tomorrow in the debate on the state of the Union. We must start by doing our work internally. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (ES)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, in the previous debate, Baroness Ashton said that you were appalled by the situation in Syria, and I think we have run out of words to describe it, as has been said in other debates. Indignation, frustration, impotence, and meanwhile, the bloodbath continues in Syria. We should look at events, too: Kofi Annan’s resignation in a plan that was doomed to failure from the very beginning. And statements, so many statements: a statement by the new Special Envoy, saying that this is an almost impossible mission, which makes me wonder why he accepted it; a statement by the minister of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, saying that new sanctions are to be imposed on Syria; statements by the Swedish minister, saying that he does not believe sanctions are going to have any impact; statements by the French minister, saying that we need to put more pressure on Syria. In short, a lot of words and not much action. As you rightly said, Baroness Ashton, the situation is continuing as it has done for months, but with even more deaths. The regime is sheltering behind the complicity of Russia and China in the United Nations Security Council, and the opposition is winning support across the regional sphere, hoping that sooner or later, there will be international intervention. In the meantime, Baroness Ashton, I believe the time has come for the EU and regional actors to make a decision. I would like to ask you to answer some specific questions. Do you agree with the statement made by the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, who said the time has come to do something if the Security Council does not make any progress? Do you believe it is viable to establish humanitarian corridors? Do you think it is possible to establish a no-fly zone? Do you believe it is desirable and advisable to arm, support and help the opposition? Baroness Ashton, more than 20 000 dead people are looking to us, and we have to turn our words into actions. You have done a very good job of providing humanitarian aid, and continue to do so, but our purpose is not to be an International Red Cross. We want to have political leverage, with other actors, in order to stop this carnage. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, despite the financial crisis, I do not think we should forget that the European integration project is based on values: peace, understanding, harmony, reconciliation and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are part of the genetic code of the European Union. Not only are they part of the genetic code of the European Union, but they are also laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Among the institutions, surely Parliament is the one that is most committed to defending rights and fundamental freedoms and has a total and permanent commitment to the cause of human rights, which must not just apply to one region, country or continent, but which must be of a global or universal nature. Parliament has therefore given a Vice-President the responsibility for monitoring human rights; it has a body, which is the Subcommittee on Human Rights, as part of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET); it has created a new working group on democracy and electoral observation and there is always a section in its order of business dedicated to resolutions to defend human rights. Obviously, Parliament has distinguished itself by awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, which, as you know, was founded by a person who left a legacy promoting peace, respect, tolerance and peoples living together peacefully. Madam President, in this context, I am delighted to present this report which, in the form of recommendations, discusses the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights, and I would like to thank members of my political group for the prior work they have done and also thank the other political groups for their work and support. An important aspect, Baroness Ashton, is the mandate of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights. The representative must work to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, international justice and humanitarian law; to promote the abolition of the death penalty; and in all areas aimed at defending the causes of human rights’ defenders, fighting torture and impunity, defending women’s rights, child protection and the rights of minors, peace and security and, of course, the rejection of all forms of discrimination. The EU Special Representative must work very directly with Parliament and other international bodies, and must work in a context of visibility, flexibility and coherence with the historical aspects that I mentioned at the start of my speech, Madam President. The representative must be a person of broad experience, proven ability, international prestige and, of course, sufficient professional experience in the field of human rights. Obviously, Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Parliament does not seek to hijack the decision-making process for appointing this person, as it is up to the High Representative to make the proposal to the Council. However, in this context, I would like to highlight the particular importance of this appointment and the desire that, based on the trust and the mandate represented by the resolution that Parliament is going to adopt, you make the right appointment. This person is going to have a huge profile in defending this cause which, as I said, Parliament sees as a total and permanent commitment to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank some of my fellow Members for the work they did in advance to prepare this report and, of course, all those who have spoken in this debate. I note with satisfaction, Baroness Ashton, your firm commitment to ensuring that the EU Special Representative has a link with and works permanently and continuously with Parliament. Beyond the terms of the mandate, on which we have spoken extensively during this debate, and which, in my opinion, should also be applied to the interpretation of the democratic clause that we have with some third countries, there remains the question of the personal profile of the candidate. I was personally very pleased by the speech made by Mr Mitchell regarding the profile that this person should have, which brings to mind the anecdote sometimes told about when, in fourth century Athens, after the age of Pericles, Aristotle was walking with his pupils of the Peripatetic School and one of them made an observation that displeased his teacher. When Aristotle answered, the pupil said to him, ‘that is not my observation, but that of your teacher Plato’. Aristotle’s response has been repeated numerous times on the European stage from the fourth century BC to the present day and our technological and Internet era: ‘Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is the truth’. I believe that the Special Representative must be an integral part of the institutional structure of the European Union, report to the High Representative, have a link to Parliament and the Member States, but that what must be more dear to him or her must be the cause of defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, so that human rights and fundamental freedoms, as Parliament wishes, can take hold in the 21st century across the world. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus on the case of Syria. We have run out of adjectives to describe the deterioration of the situation there and the growing number of victims, including executed women and children. The words that best describe the way the international community feels are indignation and, of course, a feeling of frustration and powerlessness. It is clear that Kofi Annan’s plan has failed spectacularly and that we will need to think about other options. Keeping a minute’s silence – as occurred recently at the United Nations – and applying economic sanctions are hardly ways to overcome this situation. The Secretary General of the United Nations has said quite clearly that the President of Syria has entirely lost his legitimacy and that we cannot become accustomed to massacres being a daily occurrence. This situation and this conflict are dragging on too long, in my view, with the complicity, in particular, of a permanent member of the Security Council and of the Iranian regime. Baroness Ashton, a moment ago in this House, we had an extensive debate on the European Union’s role in defending rights and fundamental freedoms in the EU. Above and beyond our presence in the various contact groups, which is entirely justified, the EU has an obligation to put forward initiatives to bring an end to this situation and prevent the President of Syria from continuing to buy more time and massacring the opposition. It is also clear that the Syrian National Council must cooperate, and we hope that its new president, elected in Istanbul the other day, can unite the internal and external opposition. However, given the failure of diplomatic measures, there are not many options left open: humanitarian intervention, which is currently not possible due to the vetoes by Russia and China in the Security Council; political agreements with President al-Assad, which are continuing to result in him buying more time and cruelly repressing the opposition; or other mechanisms that would ultimately result in a civil war being sparked, which is already practically the case. Experience in neighbouring countries has shown us that, in order to try to bring an end to this situation in the short term, we need to seek political solutions to transfer power in the medium term. In this context, this solution is very difficult without a military presence and international troops. These are my questions, Baroness Ashton: do you ultimately think it will be possible to provide a military presence in order to try to respond and stop the dreadful conflict currently taking place in Syria? Who would be responsible for supplying those troops? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s debate in the House and the resolution that will be adopted afterwards, we wanted to highlight the importance of this association agreement between the European Union and Ukraine for the country’s European prospects, and as we have been reminded in this debate, a key element of the agreement is the democracy clause on respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, and respect for the rules of the democratic game. It is clear that the trial, conviction and humanitarian situation of Yulia Tymoshenko and of others blatantly violate the spirit and letter of this democratic clause. Parliament therefore must show its solidarity with these people, request that their rights be fully respected, strongly condemn the use of force, as has been observed, and, of course, ensure that opposition leaders can stand in the next elections, many of whom are currently in jail, like Yulia Tymoshenko. For that reason, I agree with what the Commissioner, Mr Füle said, in the sense that the signing of the association agreement cannot occur under these circumstances, and therefore, Parliament should not go ahead and ratify it. Secondly, without questioning the hosting of the European Football Championships, which is being organised jointly with Poland, I believe, and I am addressing you, Commissioner, that the European Union should try to give a joint response, given that we are supposed to be trying to establish a common foreign and security policy, as such that the representatives of the European Union and the Member States can act in a homogenous, joint manner from a shared standpoint. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we are debating an agreement between the European Union and Peru and Colombia, and speaking of human rights, Mr President, I would like Parliament to condemn the assassination of 12 members of the Colombian armed forces yesterday at the hands of the FARC terrorist organisation, 150 metres from the Venezuelan border. And I think, Mr President, that Parliament should convey its condemnation, warmth and solidarity to Colombian society as a whole and the victims’ families during these difficult times. The Commission has made it abundantly clear, Mr President, that we should not emphasise an ongoing dynamic of demands that has not been imposed on other countries that have signed up to agreements of this type. I think we should place emphasis on the fact that this agreement is a clear and predictable framework to try to overcome a regime of unilateral concessions, which I want to remind my colleagues already exists, is in force, and is going to affect trade, investments and services. And in this context, I am greatly surprised that many Members in this House state that they have doubts about this agreement, but that they do not have doubts about the human rights situation in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras or Nicaragua, with which the European Union has reached the same type of agreement, or in Mexico, where we all know about the rates of violence. What is true, Mr President, is that this agreement is going to put Peru and Colombia on an equal footing with other countries that benefit from the same facilities, as is clearly the case with Chile, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, Israel and the CARICOM nations. I believe, Mr President, that the European Union, its 27 Member States, the Commission, Peru and Colombia have signed this agreement, and I believe that we are falling into the trap of a paternalism exercise if we tell our partner countries what is good for them or what is no longer good for them. I think they are mature enough to know that they want this agreement because the European Union is a useful partner. And I believe, Mr President, that instead of considering introducing discriminatory and additional measures, what we have to do is to find out why, after almost two and a half years, Commissioner, this agreement has not yet been ratified. I do not think this situation paints the European Union in a good light and that, on the contrary, we should swiftly ratify it. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Mr President, I think we should congratulate ourselves on having made the decision to hold a debate and adopt a resolution. However, bearing in mind that Baroness Ashton will not be present in Parliament tomorrow due to a commitment she has with NATO defence ministers, I believe it would be appropriate to alter the agenda so that we could hear her speak, because she intends to make a statement on that very issue. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Howitt concerns human rights, including political, social and economic rights. That is why I should particularly like to thank you, Baroness Ashton, for the statement you made on the situation that has arisen in the Repsol company before we began our debate on this report. You said a great deal in a short time. You mentioned a wrong decision; a threat to investments and the future of Argentina; the need to comply with the commitments that were made; the measures you took to include this issue on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council; the postponement of the meeting of the EU-Argentina Joint Cooperation Committee; as well as analysing possible measures. With regard to Mr Howitt’s report, Madam President, I believe it is a reasonable report in general terms, although clearly some matters still need to be addressed, such as the decision to send a fact-finding mission to Gaza – which is a request that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) obviously cannot accept, as the rapporteur is well aware – and Mr Howitt’s position on Colombia, which is quite simply delusional. That amendment was already rejected in the vote taken in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and, for us, at a time when we are waiting for the Multipart Trade Agreement between Peru, Colombia and the European Union to be ratified, it is unacceptable. Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to highlight a fundamental aspect of our human rights policy, one with which Parliament has an irrevocable and unquestionable commitment. I am referring to the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. Parliament will vote on this issue in a resolution, and we would like the selection procedure for this individual to be objective, Baroness Ashton, so that the person appointed can truly have the merit and capability to fulfil this important role to the high level it certainly deserves. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, a threefold game is currently being played out in Syria. Several things are being determined: the influence that Iran and Saudi Arabia will have; the role that Egypt is going to play in the context of the Arab Spring; and the vacuum created by the election campaign in the United States, which China and Russia would both like to fill. The apparent good news is the unanimous adoption of this resolution in the United Nations Security Council. The important thing here, Mr President, is that the adoption of this resolution should be consistent with the attitude of those countries as regards the situation that has arisen in Syria. The path of diplomacy is slow to produce results, and meanwhile, Mr al-Assad is gaining time in order to continue repressing the population. The truth, Baroness Ashton, is that although we need to support Mr Annan’s plan, we are sending out mixed signals to the international community. On the one hand, Mr al-Assad remains in power, gaining time – for he knows that the veto by China and Russia enables him to massacre his population with impunity – and, on the other hand, we are sending out a message to dissidents that there is no short-term solution. It is therefore important, Mr President, that we should take all these factors into consideration; the EU deserves recognition for the action it has taken on humanitarian aid, the mobilisation of funds with Ms Georgieva, which you just mentioned, and its continued support for the deployment of this mission. However, as a diplomat from my country pointed out – and rightly so, I believe – according to the basis of Mr Annan’s plan, the solution to the conflict unfortunately has to begin with Mr al-Assad, but it also has to end with his removal.

 On behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we want to declare that our vote on the resolution on the European integration process of Kosovo is based on the fact that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it was a normal independent state, recognised by the international community, and does not take into account that the status of this territory continues to be controversial. It has yet to be recognised by a majority of countries, five of which are Member States of the European Union, including Spain. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, in the interests of achieving the broadest consensus possible, we believe that this resolution should receive wide support from this House, and so we propose an oral amendment to Amendment 5, in agreement with Mr Swoboda, Mr Verhofstadt and the other political groups. In the English version, this oral amendment consists of adding the words ‘strengthening and implementation’ after the word ‘introduction’, and the replacement of the word ‘condemns’ by the word ‘deplores’.

 Mr President, Mr Søvndal, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate on Russia is of great concern to us and forces us to choose between what is desirable and what is possible. The resolution that Parliament will have to vote on tomorrow addresses the very specific set of circumstances that have followed the presidential elections. We are faced with an official Russia which still harks back to the era of the Soviet Union and which feels entitled to veto freedom within the United Nations Security Council. This is a Russia where the President and the Prime Minister shamelessly take turns to be in power. A Russia where elections are not held in compliance with international standards, and a Russia where opposition figures are detained, which takes us back to the recent and far from glorious past. However, Mr President, this is also a Russia which is a member of the Council of Europe and of the World Trade Organisation, which duly collaborates with the OECD and wishes to become one of its members, and a Russia where, as in the Arab Spring countries, there are men and women who are fighting for their freedom and dignity. Mr President, I think what is central to this resolution is to work for change and to open a space for dialogue and conversation with the opposition whose rights have been infringed and ignored. We should leave until later, until Mr Swoboda’s report, the issue of the institutional framework, the new association agreement between the European Union and Russia, two entities that need to come to an understanding. Mr President, I think that from the viewpoint of the European Union – I would like to appeal to the President-in-Office of the Council and to the Commission’s representative – that we should mobilise all our efforts and influence to make what is desirable become possible, so that fundamental freedoms and the rights of all will soon become a reality throughout Russia.

on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, surely the deterioration of the political situation in Belarus, the problem of the political prisoners and the crisis that has arisen in relation to the EU ambassadors, which was analysed by the Foreign Affairs Council last Saturday, require that Parliament hold a debate on this issue. Therefore, Mr President, we call for a statement by the High Representative or, if she cannot be present, by the President-in-Office and, of course, by the Commissioner for Neighbourhood Policy and for a debate to take place. Accordingly, Mr President, we ask that, on the basis of this statement, this matter be included in the agenda, together with a debate and a resolution. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are three independent and developing factors affecting the Syrian crisis. Firstly, a kind of cold war between Saudi Arabia and, currently, Iran, which is becoming apparent on several fronts, and specifically in Syria at the moment, then, what is clearly a domino effect from the so-called ‘Arab Spring’, and finally, a greater desire on the part of China and Russia and other players in the Middle East conflict to make their presence felt and to fill the vacuum left by the European Union and the United States. We have followed the High Representative’s actions with a great deal of interest: suspension of development aid, humanitarian help, a contingency plan, the tightening of sanctions at the next Council of Ministers on 27 February, and support to the Arab League initiative. A more effective and coordinated diplomatic response from the Member States of the European Union was lacking, however. Unfortunately, none of those decisions has led to a short-term reduction in the intolerable violence that is being suffered by the Syrian people, hence the frustration we all share. The French Foreign Minister expressed that view today during an appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, in relation to the failure of the initiative and the Russian and Chinese vetoes in the United Nations Security Council. An initiative from Qatar and Saudi Arabia is being debated in the General Assembly as we speak, with the specific aim of ratifying the agreement, even though we know that it does not have any binding effects. What can we do about this situation? Increase the pressure on Russia and China, certainly. Two very appropriate occasions for doing so have arisen recently: one was the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of China to the United States, where he was received with full honours, and, of course, the EU-China Summit that has just taken place. It is also clear that we have to strengthen our relationship with the Syrian dissidents, and we have to see how this humanitarian corridor they have requested can be established and developed. In addition, it is clear is that the questions the Foreign Ministers of the Arab League asked themselves the other day also apply to us. How long are we going to remain impassive towards the violence that the Syrian people are currently suffering? Also, what is our tolerance limit when deadline after deadline passes, initiatives come and go, and the regime continues butchering the Syrian people? It is my belief, Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Secretary-General of the European External Action Service, that this is the key issue to be considered in today’s debate.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to bring up the matter of the El Universo
 newspaper in Ecuador. The facts are well known. The President of the Republic of Ecuador has brought criminal proceedings against the journalist, the newspaper and its owners because of the opinion that was expressed. The proceedings have led to a three-year sentence, given by two courts, and a fine of USD 40 million, which presents a serious threat to the newspaper’s very survival. A number of organisations have made reference to this matter, such as Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, and other international media and organisations working in the field of human rights. My question, Baroness Ashton, is very simple: are you aware of these facts? What is your opinion on the matter? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, as you are aware, Baroness Ashton, Ecuador is linked to the EU by a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement, which is based on the democratic clause and respect for fundamental rights, one of which is the right to freedom of expression. As you rightly said, on 10 February the Supreme Court will give its verdict on the appeal for this case; President Correa has said that he would be prepared to withdraw the court action if he is issued an apology. In addition to the concern you have expressed for freedom of expression in Ecuador, what would you be prepared to do in order to find a balanced, fair solution that respects the principle of freedom of expression?

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, on 23 January the Council took a difficult but consistent decision, and for that I congratulate Baroness Ashton. This Parliament will support the Council conclusions in the resolution we will vote on tomorrow. As you have just explained, it was difficult because it required sacrifices by several Member States, and it was consistent because it is in keeping with the positions we have defended so far. Both the President of France and the Prime Ministers of France and the United Kingdom have said that they will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. However, as well as being consistent, these measures need to be effective in order to promote the path of dialogue, bring Iran back to the negotiating table, ensure its full cooperation with the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and also, Baroness Ashton, to silence the drums of war that can be heard. Israel has said that all options are being considered, and one Republican candidate in the United States has said that swift action should be taken. Furthermore, some Iranian ministers have said that these sanctions will be ineffective, because the EU needs Iranian crude oil more that Iran needs the EU’s resources. What is more, the threat to close the Strait of Hormuz and the risk of escalating tension in the region could have serious repercussions for oil prices and further complicate the difficult economic situation we are going through. That is why, Baroness Ashton, I would like to say to you that, beyond the internal dimension and the consistency that were shown in the Council decisions of 23 January, it is also important to take action with our allies at this stage as regards our external scope and influence. You just told us that you visited India; the stance taken by India, Japan and other countries is vital to ensure that the measures adopted can have the effect that many of us are hoping for.

 Mr President, High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as Baroness Ashton has said, the situation in Syria is getting worse by the day, with an extremely high toll in terms of human life. You mentioned the figures released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: more than 4 000 people, of whom 1 000 are members of the security forces, and this augurs a bloody civil war in the country. Statements of condemnation have come from all sides – the United States, the European Council, the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union. However, Baroness Ashton, I believe that the time has come to move from words to action, because condemnation alone will not bring a halt to this situation. On the economic side, what can we do? You got it right, Baroness Ashton: implement the economic sanctions we have introduced, stop Syrian oil imports to the European Union and support the decisions of the Arab League and Turkey. On the political front, we should firstly support the deployment of ground forces requested by the Arab League. Secondly, we should strengthen relations with the Syrian National Council. I would also like to ask your opinion, Baroness Ashton, on the French initiative to create a humanitarian corridor protected by international troops. Lastly, we should obtain a more solid resolution from the United Nations, overcoming the reticence of some permanent members of the Security Council, such as China and Russia, whose position is absolutely unjustifiable, continuing in the vein of Resolutions 1970 and 1973, which, in the case of Libya, made it possible to put an end to a government’s criminal violence against its own people. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the next EU-US summit will be determined by the economic and financial crisis. I believe that both parties should adopt a modest approach and apply that Chinese proverb that, before launching ourselves into the task of putting the world to rights, we should first take a look at our own house. This means weighing up the global influence of each party and highlighting the role and the economic, commercial, financial and industrial weight of the European Union. Beyond the economic and financial problems, I believe that it is important to consider the lessons learned in Libya, after Operation Unified Protector, where the European Union was criticised. We should also consider the situation in Syria, after today’s meeting of the Arab League and try to move forward the search for a resolution in the Security Council of the United Nations. Then there is the peace process in the Middle East, which the Commissioner referred to, and the Palestinian question, in which the European Union gave a pitiful performance at the vote in UNESCO. We should also ask for greater consistency between words and deeds after the speech of President Obama in the United States. It is clear, Madam President, that the European Union and the United States are two partners who have a shared vision of the world, and although this is not always identical, they have a duty to understand and respect each other. Therefore it must be accepted that in today’s globalised world, in the face of challenges and threats that affect us all equally – whether it is the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime, the economic and financial crisis or unemployment, protecting the environment and natural resources or emigration – we must search for responses to all of these equally. It must also be accepted that unilateralism, even for the most prosperous and the most powerful, is an impossible dream. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, a balanced approach to the problem should be based on three premises: the State of Israel’s legitimate desire for security, the frustration of the Palestinian people and the blockage in the peace process. All of this, Baroness Ashton, comes at a time when international attention is focused on the Arab Spring, at a time when the United States is hampered by its electoral commitments, at a time when the government of Israel is divided and has almost no room for manoeuvre and when Palestinian radicals are increasingly showing their pleasure with the lack of results. Given this situation, Baroness Ashton, the question is very simple: what can we do as the European Union? In this context, I would like to tell you that Parliament, which has criticised you so many times – and I have been the first to do so – must acknowledge your efforts to seek solutions in Cairo, Ramallah, Jerusalem, New York and Washington, and your calls for the European Union to speak with one voice. In politics, Madam President, whatever is impossible is wrong. In the face of the United States’ announced veto in the Security Council, the President of France, as in the Georgia crisis in 2008 and this year in Libya, has proposed a compromise solution, which is the Vatican solution. Baroness Ashton, what view should we take of this initiative? Do you think it can be supported by the Member States? What can the European Union do to make the Quartet’s solution acceptable to the Palestinians? Madam President, if the European Union wants to be relevant and not decline in significance on the international stage, it must take a step forwards. It must move in the right direction and rouse itself from its lethargy. I am not saying this because of you, Baroness Ashton. You have done a lot and you have done it well, but you must propose solutions that are concrete, tangible, with defined costs and a precise timetable. You need to do this – and this is the hard part – without impinging on or harming the dignity of either side, while also recognising the inalienable rights that will enable one side to live in peace and security and the others to form their own state.

 Madam President, Commissioner, if we consider that a 42-year dictatorship has been brought to an end within a period of six months, in theory that could sound like a relatively short time frame. However, if we take this into account and consider it in the context of the human lives lost, the suffering caused and the setback this will bring for generations to come, then I think our assessment will be significantly different. In any event, everything remains to be done now that Muammar Gaddafi’s regime has fallen: provide humanitarian aid; guarantee security; establish order and control along the borders; bring about economic reconstruction, as well as a process of transition under extremely difficult circumstances; and ensure that there is no impunity for crimes committed. The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Dowgielewicz, has just said – and I agree with his assessment – that, within the framework of both NATO and the European Union, this despicable regime has been done away with thanks, in particular, to the action taken by specific Member States – such as France and the United Kingdom – and thanks to the determination and courage shown by the Libyan people. We should also acknowledge that the European Union, after some early wavering and remaining within the scope of its powers, acted swiftly and properly. It is true, as well, that Parliament was the first authority to call for the recognition of the National Transitional Council (NTC), thanks – if truth be told – to an invitation by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. It should also be noted that France was the first country to recognise the NTC. We have EUR 154 million in humanitarian aid, and a newly opened EU Office in Benghazi and Tripoli, which should quickly be upgraded to delegation status and for which a head of delegation with auctoritas
 should be appointed as soon as possible in order to tackle the important task of coordinating EU action with the Member States, and also with the Office that the Secretary General of the United Nations requested from the United Nations Security Council. Madam President, Mr Dowgielewicz, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, just three days ago in this Parliament we, like many others around the globe, commemorated the tenth anniversary of the vicious terrorist attack on the Twin Towers. The EU must make the Arab Spring one of its absolute priorities for two reasons: firstly, in order to live up to that cry for freedom and dignity that is spreading through North Africa and the Arab nations; and secondly, to prevent radical Islamic fundamentalism from taking root in the societies around us and interrupting the process of transition that is under way in those countries and, above all, to prevent freedom from being threatened once again by barbarity and fanaticism. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Secretary-General, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the interest we have been taking in the Arab Spring, as shown by the debate we have just had on Libya and Syria, should not distract our attention away from the situation in the Middle East and, in particular, from the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. This issue can be approached from an outside perspective – any implications that the outcome of the General Assembly might have on the peace process, and any change to the status quo, count a great deal – and from the perspective of the internal dimension of the EU. With regard to the external perspective, the peace process is in deadlock, as Mr Dowgielewicz has just told us. We are seeing increased tension in the region – the most tangible evidence of that was the attack on the Israeli embassy in Egypt – and also very particular circumstances for the United States government. President Obama is going to have difficulty meeting the proposals he set out in his inaugural speech in Cairo, because of the situation within the United States and also as a result of the electoral process he will soon have to face. Mr President, in politics anything that is not possible is false; without wishing to prejudge the substance of the resolution that is going to be adopted, I believe that we should start getting ready to adopt a draft resolution that improves the status of Palestine within the United Nations. This leads me on to the internal dimension of this issue: it is vital that the EU can express itself in a united voice on this sensitive point. Our past experiences in the United Nations have not been glorious. To be sure, we have shifted position in light of the new mechanisms established by the Treaty of Lisbon, and I believe that we need to focus all our efforts on three objectives: the peace process must move forward, and the status quo of a lack of negotiations must end; the chances to move forward on this issue must not be compromised or endangered; and the dignity of both parties in this conflict must be respected. Mr President, on this point I feel that the EU’s greatest strength is its union, and its greatest weakness is its division. I would therefore ask Mr Dowgielewicz – I realise, of course, that the Commissioner and Baroness Ashton are doing all they can on the matter – to ensure that the European Union faces this sensitive issue without showing its customary division, and appears united by making a positive, active contribution to the progress that needs to be made in this conflict.

Mr President, they say that when the celebrated thinker, Ortega y Gasset, was asked what distance one needed to be from events in order to write history, he said, far enough not to be able to see the profile of Cleopatra’s nose. Lady Ashton, I bring this anecdote up not because Egypt is a country affected by the Arab Spring but rather because in the EU, we are experiencing an historic dilemma involving a lack of confidence in our project, debt crisis, the calling into question of the basic achievements that are most valued by our citizens, such as the Schengen area, and doubts over the ability of NATO. However, over the last two and a half years, we have experienced tangible progress in the form of your own duties as Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the birth of the European External Action Service and the Joint Communication on a renewed European Neighbourhood Policy. You said yesterday that our neighbours will always be there and I share that view. The question is about us, whether we will rise to the occasion, whether we will live up to the expectations of our citizens, who regard foreign policy as a barometer for the state of the EU, whether we will be able to accompany these transition processes effectively in the countries that are the subject of the resolution that we will adopt tomorrow. Lady Ashton, we are clearly backing that. We believe and hope that you will succeed in your work, but in order to do so, you must act with the highest profile. Not a physical profile, like in Ortega’s response, but rather a political profile, with particular emphasis on finding the greatest common denominator and not the lowest common multiple. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the central factor in this overly broad debate should be the situation in North Africa and the Near East. We must approach this debate without extolling virtues – Baroness Ashton has rightly highlighted some positive elements; I would emphasise the good or, rather, the better provision of information between Parliament and the European External Action Service – yet also without concealing defects, and a voice as sensible as that of Giorgio Napolitano, our former fellow Member and President of the Italian Republic, has reminded us of this recently. Among the negative aspects, and despite the efforts of Baroness Ashton, is the different yardsticks against which the cases of Libya and Syria are measured in the United Nations Security Council and also in the Council of Ministers of the European Union. Also among the negative aspects, Baroness Ashton, is the situation of Camp Ashraf: you are aware of the positive, constructive and moderating role that my group is playing in the development of foreign policy, and believe me when I say that the importance and sensitivity of the Iranian dossier has not escaped me. However, in spite of the warnings about the humanitarian aspect made to your services, to your collaborators, to your cabinet and to your Director-General, and despite the fact that I submitted a draft statement to you myself, you did not speak out until there had been 32 deaths and more than 300 wounded. You can draw your own conclusions. You yourself said this morning that we have to act and we have to be coherent, particularly in relation to the defence of human rights; especially by taking risks, Baroness Ashton, when there are lives in danger. My question to you is this: with regard to the Cuban dissident, Juan Wilfredo Soto García, who was arrested, beaten and finally killed, are you willing to call for an investigation to shed light on these tragic events? If this investigation shows that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the beating received and his death, are you willing to condemn them? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I entirely agree with what you have just said. Mr Németh, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that we have been continuously following the flow of information provided by the High Representative, Mrs Ashton, on the developments in these countries and I think we should recognise the efforts she is making on behalf of the European Union in support of the democratic aspirations in Bahrain, Yemen and Syria. Tomorrow, Parliament will adopt a resolution supported by all the political groups in this regard. However I would like to put forward a couple of questions, Mr President, and would ask Mr Németh to pass them on to Mrs Ashton. First of all, in some bodies of the Union and, of course, in this Parliament, there is the feeling that we are taking a step back in the development of the Common Security and Defence Policy, and that we are being taken back to the times of political cooperation. Obviously, that is not why we established the Treaty of Lisbon. Secondly, a contradiction has arisen, related to the growing need for a European presence in those countries, with no knowledge of what will be the end result of these transitional processes. It is clear that we have to be present, and it is also clear that the slogan used in Mrs Ashton’s communication is very wise: ‘more for more’ However, the question I wish to ask – and I shall conclude now, Mr President – is whether the EU Member States are willing to increase resources to meet the growing needs that are emerging in those countries. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Madam President, the crisis in North Africa is putting the mechanisms established in the Treaty of Lisbon to the test. Yesterday, in the High Representative’s appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we stressed the positive aspects of European Union action: Baroness Ashton’s communication that distinguishes between the short, medium and long terms; rapid application of Resolution 1970 of the United Nations Security Council; the ability to negotiate with the Arab League; and the European Council meeting. However, it is only fair to say here today that there are still certain questions being asked by European public opinion and, therefore, by our citizens. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt is absolutely right. How is it possible that, in this day and age, the four Member States that form part of the United Nations Security Council do not vote in the same way but rather do so differently? How is it possible, in this day and age, that we should be discussing whether the United Nations resolution is applied by the European Union, by NATO or by the international coalition, when we are talking about the same resources coming from the same taxpayers; about the same ships and their use in the same theatre of operations? It is clear that we still have much to improve as regards our capacity for coordination, and much to improve too in the decision-making process. There is a famous line from a film, which says that ‘we will always have Paris’. Someone said during this debate that the European Union’s response has been hasty. If it had not been for France’s courage, determination and consistency – and that is how it must be put – in recognising the rebels, in sending the Minister of Foreign and European Affairs to the Security Council, in calling the Elysée summit and in applying the resolution, Lady Ashton, Colonel Gaddafi’s troops would already have entered Benghazi.

 Mr President, the European Union finds itself torn between two frustrations in the Libyan crisis, between what is desirable – the earliest possible disappearance of a criminal regime that is determined to die killing – and what is achievable. If we are honest, Mr President, we must acknowledge that the European Union, despite all its efforts, has not lived up to public expectations. This is not a criticism, Baroness Ashton, but rather a question of powers. We have acted promptly and we have acted well, within the scope of our powers, with the European Union fully endorsing Resolution 1970 of the United Nations Security Council. However, we are not a military union. We are aspiring to be a political union, and we are still only an embryonic player on the international stage. This is why, Mr President, whilst we are holding this debate, whilst the United Nations Human Rights Council is meeting today, and whilst the Council of Ministers for Defence, the Foreign Affairs Council and the European Council are meeting tomorrow, people are still dying in Libya. It is against this backdrop that we must think about what it is that we can do. Can we stand aside whilst innocent civilians are massacred? Can we remain impassive to the ‘Somalisation’ of Libya, whilst the United Nations Security Council reaches another slow motion decision? The European Union must send a message that is loud and clear, and has a single message: ‘the Gaddafi regime must end right now’. This message must be accompanied by a set of measures that ratchet up the pressure. First and foremost, Mr President, the no-fly zone, the neutralising of Mr Gaddafi’s communications – and I believe we should congratulate the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe for bringing representatives of the Libyan opposition to the European Parliament – and, of course, international coordination, most particularly with the African Union and also with the Arab League. This, Mr President, is what the public is expecting of us, and you will have the full support of our political group to achieve it, Baroness Ashton. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, in the context of our debate on the current human rights situation, and in view of the last report discussed, I would like to address the following question to Lady Ashton. In view of the current situation in some North African countries and within the region, do you feel that this is the right time to be opening a European Union delegation in Iran? José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 – (ES)
 Mr President, I did not really understand Lady Ashton’s answer. I am not sure whether she gave me an answer, whether she said that she would respond at a later date to my question on whether it is the right time to be opening a European Union delegation in Iran given the current human rights concerns, or indeed whether there was no answer. As I did not understand the answer, I would like to repeat my question. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, you quite rightly said, Baroness Ashton, that the situation in the southern Mediterranean is diverting attention from the conflict in the Middle East and the peace process, which has already been drawn out over almost 30 years and appears to have come to a standstill. As your visit has demonstrated, current events and the general situation in the region have had an impact on the process. In the light of that visit, I would like to ask your views on a number of issues. This morning, we discussed the difficulties that the United Nations Security Council is having in obtaining a further resolution to impose a no-fly zone in Libya. To what extent do you feel that the peace process and the credibility of a key player have been affected by its recent veto of the proposed resolution condemning the settlements in the Palestinian territories? In your opinion, how does the lack of a Security Council decision affect perceptions of the Obama administration’s commitment to pursuing this process? Secondly, how do you view the decision taken by the Palestinian National Authority to hold presidential and legislative elections before September and Hamas’s decision not to take part in these elections? Lastly, Baroness Ashton, I would like to hear what you think of the resignation of the Palestinian chief negotiator following the publication of documents by WikiLeaks, the reshuffle within the Palestinian National Authority and the repercussions that the leaked documents have had on the Palestine side, on the Israeli Government, or on both parties as a whole.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mubarak has disappeared from the scene and everyone seems to have breathed a sigh of relief. Firstly, the Egyptian people, who have seen their legitimate expectations of greater dignity and democracy satisfied, and, secondly, the international community that, not without a certain cynicism, has gone from being the ally of yesterday to the nuisance of today and, perhaps, to the accused of the future. However, Madam President, I do not believe that we should deceive ourselves. The departure of Mr Mubarak and Mr Ben Alí are necessary conditions, but not sufficient, to guarantee the process of democratic transition, over which there still hang many uncertainties. The most important thing is: to consolidate democracy. Madam President, it is also evident that, although democratic freedoms and human rights can be initiated by sixteen days of protest and public spiritedness, and be proclaimed by law from morning to night, economic and social progress cannot, unfortunately, be marshalled in the same manner. We have seen this in the heavy economic losses that both Egypt and Tunisia have been suffering in recent days. Returning to the Commissioner’s speech, I would like to say that, after the initial hesitations and some problems with the EU’s image, it appears that things are back on track. Baroness Ashton is in the region and what Mr Füle proposes makes a lot of sense. Firstly, to firmly and wholeheartedly support the process of democratic transition and the political reforms in those countries.Secondly, to carry out a critical review of the European neighbourhood policy in a way that strengthens the democratic clause. We have heard today, in the Enlarged Bureau, from the Polish Foreign Minister, the next President-in-Office of the Council, and his initiative to establish a Polish foundation on the subject of democracy and human rights. This could also be extended to the entire EU. Madam President, the EU has mobilised large amounts of resources in its Euro-Mediterranean policy with poor results. The EU’s image has suffered in this conflict, even more than that of other international players. However, the EU’s appeal remains intact. I would like to say, Madam President, that this is a good opportunity to underline that the EU understands, once and for all, that today history is being made in the present and in these historic times we are living through we have to act as a global player and perform the necessary duties or we will have to resign ourselves, Madam President, to not playing on the international stage in the role we want to maintain and we will have to restrict ourselves, as was the case until now, to picking up the bill for major global problems.

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, whatever the result or outcome of the situation in Egypt, I believe that we are safe in saying that there will be a before and after the events that have taken place in Tunisia. It is my opinion that we should not be looking for culprits in this House as this crisis has caught the European Union on the wrong foot, however I feel that we ought to draw some conclusions on the matter. Firstly, the European Union needs to be more visible, it needs to speak with a unified voice and to avoid any cacophony; it is for this reason that we have created the European External Action Service and the figure of the High Representative. Secondly, we need to draw on the lessons offered to us by complacent policies with the enemies of freedom, from Belarus to Cuba and with the Mediterranean countries in between. We need to ask ourselves if there really is more stability, more prosperity and more democracy as the Barcelona Process intended. Thirdly, Mr President, I feel that we need to distinguish between what the European Union needs to do in the medium term and what it needs to do in the short term. In the short term – I think that Baroness Ashton has drawn up a road map – the European Union needs to offer resolute support to these transition processes so as not to frustrate these friendly countries’ hopes for freedom. It is also our duty, Mr President, to warn them of the risks involved in these processes, so they are not hijacked by the enemies of free societies. In the medium term, Mr President, it is important that the European Union reflects deeply on a strategic approach to reforming our neighbourhood policy as we also requested of Mr Füle yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. All of this must be done, Mr President, whilst bearing in mind that often it is more difficult to maintain the balance of freedom than to shake off the yoke of tyranny.

Mr President, as stated in the text of the oral question that we have tabled, in the last three years, we have seen an escalation of the situation detrimentally affecting European Union interests and citizens in the southern Sahara, which has become a haven for the Islamic branch of al-Qaeda, with a whole string of murders, kidnappings, extortion, blackmail, drug trafficking and people trafficking, the victims of which have been German, Italian, Spanish and, most recently, French citizens. We therefore want to express our solidarity with our French fellow Members, and say, Baroness Ashton, that this situation demands a firm, unflinching response from the European Union, as President Sarkozy has demanded. In this context, this response needs to be made in the political, economic and development spheres, and Mr Danjean reminded us of the huge resources in the European Development Fund. Baroness Ashton, I would like you to give your assessment of the G8 anti-terrorism summit in October – when you received the Council mandate – in Mali, which Algeria did not attend. You said that the response needs to be a regional one. I think it is a bad sign that two of the parties in this conflict – such as Morocco and Algeria – are not cooperating with each other, on top of the unstable situation in Tunisia. Finally, Baroness Ashton, I would like you to give your assessment of the anti-terrorist centre created by Algeria 2 000 km south of Algiers, in which Mali, Mauritania and Niger are participating, and to tell me if you share the interpretation that the aim of this anti-terrorist centre is to prevent the European Union and the United States from being present in order to guarantee security in the area.

Mr President, the recent events in Tunisia should encourage us to reflect with a sense of responsibility on at least two issues. Firstly, on whether policies to support the status quo 
in countries that lack democratic freedoms really contribute to stability, in this case, in our immediate vicinity. Secondly, Mr President, we should reflect on whether the disappearance of Mr Ben Ali from the political scene is sufficient to guarantee that a real democratic transition will be brought about. In my view, Mr President, the answer to both these questions is no. Therefore, Mr Füle, there needs to be a thorough reflection around why the Neighbourhood Policy, in the spirit of the Barcelona Process, has not had the intended democratising effects, and how we could or should make adjustments to it. Secondly, experience has shown us in many cases that, when there is a power vacuum, the most radicalised and extremist parties replace the process, hijack it and want to ruin it. Mr President, if it is simply to defend freedom, extremism is not a vice; if it is only to defend justice, moderation is not a virtue. This ethical imperative means that the European Union must mobilise all its efforts to help ensure that this process is not derailed. I welcome what Mr Füle said about providing electoral assistance to Tunisia, but I think that it is even more important to go a step further and support Tunisia through a European Union electoral observation mission. It is not only because of this ethical imperative that is etched in the genetic code of the European Union that we should do this, Mr President, but also in our own interests: because there is no point travelling first class if there is a passenger in economy with a bomb in his suitcase.

Madam President, the new strategic concept of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), which emerged in Lisbon, was established in order to seek to respond and adapt, firstly to a new context, in other words the disappearance of the system of blockades and the end of the Cold War. Secondly, it was established in order to adapt to the new configuration of threats, and particularly to globalisation and the fact that our armies do not have apparent enemies and our enemies do not have armies. Based on this new strategic concept, while taking into consideration Article 5 of the Treaty of Washington regarding mutual assistance, there are three aspects that I am interested in. Firstly, how to shape this strategic alliance with Europe: Baroness Ashton, I would like to ask you whether you think that Turkey should participate as much as possible in the actions and the development of the common foreign and security policy. Secondly, regarding the ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by the United States Congress, do you think that this new strategic concept will be affected if it is not ratified? Finally, what are your thoughts on the subject of the anti-missile shield? Do you think that this notion in any way compromises the goal of reducing nuclear arsenals? It seems that there are opposing views on this among the Member States. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,

 Madam President, they say that the philosopher Aristotle was walking around his famous Peripatetic School with his students when one of them made a comment that upset his master. By way of apology, he said, ‘that was not my comment, it was made by your master Plato’. Then Aristotle stopped and pronounced a sentence that has been repeated numerous times on the European stage from the fourth century BC to the present day. He said, ‘Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is the truth’. Madam President, Morocco is a positive and active partner of the European Union, and it is also a strategic and fundamental ally in containing radical Islamic fundamentalism. However, as President Sarkozy said when he spoke here, Parliament is the democratic heartbeat of the European Union, and has an irrevocable and undeniable commitment to the cause of human rights. Therefore, if these rights are not acknowledged, it cannot stand aside and look the other way. It must speak out loud and clear about the principles that drive us. Madam President, the European Union has been, is and will be a loyal partner of Morocco, but that partnership is based on principles and values, and we have to proclaim those principles and values. I will conclude now, Madam President, by saying that truly, moderation in character or temperament is always a virtue, but moderation in the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially freedom of expression, is always a vice, always a weakness and always cowardly, and as representatives of the people of the European Union we cannot allow ourselves to act in that way.

Relations between the European Union and the United States are, as has already been said, based on principles, ideas, a shared history and a shared passion for freedom. These values could, however, end up being diluted in rhetoric and languishing if we do not move from words to actions. One of the most reliable pieces of work that has been done in this House on the state of transatlantic relations since the presidential elections is the report by my colleague, Mr Millán Mon. The report is included in the current joint motion for a resolution that we will vote on tomorrow, and contains a series of specific initiatives that are still perfectly valid for establishing a genuine partnership, on which we need to get to work, Commissioner. Here, there has been talk of the importance of economic and trade relations, and 15 EU Member States alone invest more in Texas than the 50 US States invest in Japan. We need to give new impetus to the summit mechanisms, create a Euro-American Assembly and, most importantly, create a coordination and consultation mechanism for global issues and the most crucial areas of the world – the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan – and relations with the emerging powers. Mr President, during President Obama’s recent tour of the Middle East, we heard him say that they saw their most important partnership as being that between the United States and India. This reminded me of one of the fundamental aspects of Mr Millán Mon’s report, in which he recalled President Obama saying in Berlin that Europe was the most important strategic ally of the United States. The upcoming EU-US summit will be a wonderful opportunity to clarify this point and to clearly define what the strategic partnership really is. We could start by asking the United States to support the European Union in its demands to have an institutional presence, for example, in the United Nations General Assembly, based on the new approaches introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon.

Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks for the work done by the general rapporteur on the budget. Although, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we have exercised moderation and we are aware that the appropriations under heading 4 are increasing substantially above the average, we consider them to be insufficient for guaranteeing a consistent, visible and effective foreign policy that is in line with the ambitions introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. We are also surprised that the Council is expressing surprise at some of the tactical cuts being proposed by Parliament, given the significance of the cuts, both in terms of compromise appropriations and in terms of payment appropriations, which the Council itself has introduced. I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets, represented here by its Chair, for putting the appropriations for the new positions in the European External Action Service in reserve. Naturally, Mr President, this does not mean that we should not have a positive and constructive attitude, but obviously, in the conciliation process, Parliament has to be firm, very firm, in demanding its priorities, with the objective and aim of having the capacity to produce a budget for 2011, just as the President-in-Office of the Council has just said.

 Madam President, today’s debate does indeed raise the question of how to build a strategic partnership with China based on its economic potential and on our value system, particularly with respect to human rights, which have to be of a universal nature. Garton Ash, a brilliant British analyst, said that relations with China pose four problems, all of which begin with the letter ‘t’: trade, Taiwan, Tibet – and here, I would like to remind the House of the suspension of the EU-China summit in 2008 – and lastly, Tiananmen, in reference to the human rights issue. What is obvious, as Mr Kasoulides has said, is that none of the challenges facing the world at present, such as globalisation, the digital economy, reform of the financial system, the security issue, the fight against nuclear proliferation – just look at the case of Iran – environmental and natural resource conservation or energy supply security, can be resolved without the cooperation of China. The United States has managed to establish a structured relationship with China, though not without its problems. President Bush presented the Dalai Lama with the Congressional Gold Medal; nonetheless, relations between both countries are still functional. Commissioner, bearing in mind the importance of China on the world scene, in the United Nations Security Council, in the G20 and in the BRIC countries, will we, as the European Union, be capable of building and consolidating this relationship? More importantly, Madam President, will we, from the European Union, be able to smooth out the path to freedom given that rather unique system that is Chinese state capitalism? I believe, Madam President, that this is the most important question, and I would ask you, Commissioner, to defend our value system at the forthcoming summit, while also displaying a certain pragmatism.

Mr President, we are all pleased about the freeing of political prisoners in Cuba. However, on the subject of congratulations, I have not heard any offered to the Catholic Church and, in particular, to Parliament for the role it played, which has been key in the determined defence of all of those fighting for their freedom and dignity in Cuba. With regard to the subject of Mercosur, there are several clarifications that need to be made. As Commissioner De Gucht has explained, the Commission put forward some negotiation directives for the purposes of concluding an association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which were adopted by the Council and by Parliament. Negotiations have been deadlocked for six years, and it is clear that they have been reopened within the framework of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, with the support also of Parliament. The objective, at this point in time, is to reach a balanced agreement that shows overall consideration for the interests of all sectors within the European Union. I do not understand why certain sectors or interest groups should come out of this negotiation at a disadvantage. It has not been like this for 10 years, and there is no reason why it should be like this in the future. It will depend on the firmness of our negotiators. In any case, if this situation were to come about, it is clear that the Commission would need to come up with compensatory measures for the sectors affected. This is what has been done with third countries, with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and with the most recent agreements with the Andean Community. The main reason that this has been done with these countries is the need to defend European Union producers, of bananas in this case.

On behalf of the Spanish delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), we would like to state that the reasoning behind our vote on the resolution on the process relating to the European integration of Kosovo is that this resolution treats Kosovo as if it were an independent state in an entirely normal situation, without taking into account the fact that the status of this territory continues to be very controversial within the international community – an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice is also pending – and Kosovo has not been recognised by five Member States of the European Union, including Spain.

 Mr President, the consultation procedure concludes with today’s declaration by the High Representative and tomorrow’s vote. It is therefore now time to thank all those whose work has made the European External Action Service (EEAS) possible, especially the European Parliament’s rapporteurs, to implement it faithfully and to ensure that it is able to come into operation as soon as possible, without losing sight of the fact that it is not an end in itself, but an instrument for providing the European Union with a foreign policy that is coherent, visible and effective. I am convinced that the guarantees that Baroness Ashton gave in her declaration are satisfactory from the point of view of political responsibility, and are in line with the prerogatives that the treaty assigns to Parliament as part of the information, consultation and partnership process. You may be assured, Baroness Ashton, that this House will be a loyal partner in the development of foreign and common security policy, as we have shown in the meetings that we have held with the new heads of delegation from Washington and Afghanistan., However, Baroness Ashton, we have a right to expect that the new service will be more effective and better than the existing one. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to wish you luck in putting the EEAS into practice, and say to you that, as the evangelical instruction has it, ‘by your works shall you be known’.

Mr President, irrespective of the contradictory versions of events – humanitarian flotilla or provocation strategy – Parliament must condemn the use of violence and must condemn the loss of human life, as it is irreparable. There are causes behind these events, and they have had consequences. Apart from the most distressing consequence which, as I said, is the loss of human life, the consequences include the derailment of the peace process; the distancing between Israel, the European Union and the United States; the separation in relations with moderate Arab countries; and increased tension in the region, with the Iranian nuclear spectre hovering over the whole area. I also think, Mr President, that the breakdown in relations with Turkey is an important factor. Baroness Ashton said something that I entirely agree with. Restoring dignity and hope to the Palestinian people will benefit the cause of peace in the region, security in Israel and, above all, the cause of the moderates and the unity of the Palestinian cause. It is certain – and we should not lose sight of this – that the lifting of the embargo is just one step. It is an important step, but it is just one step along the road towards peace. We are aware of the elements: the recognition of a viable Palestinian state; security for Israel’s borders; the resolution of the problem of East Jerusalem; the problem of the settlements, which needs to be brought to an end; and – I am concluding, Mr President – other issues. There are two issues involved in resolving this matter. One is international support and the other is political will. I am not sure, High Representative, that there is currently a sufficient mobilisation of political will. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

Mr President, this is an oral amendment tabled by my colleague Mr Brok, who unfortunately cannot be with us this morning.

In view of the fact that some of the expressions included in paragraph 34, introduced by the opinion of the Committee on Development, are so ambiguous that they could be interpreted as being somewhat complacent regarding something as repulsive as abortion, the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has asked the group for a separate vote on that paragraph, in order to make it crystal clear that it is opposed to any initiative aimed at infringing the inalienable rights of the most vulnerable.

Madam President, High Representative, I would like to say that the report, as adopted by the committee, on the one hand, acknowledges the efforts made by the Spanish Presidency of the European Union – which I do not see in this Chamber, which surprises me given that we are talking about a Latin American matter – and, on the other hand, welcomes the Commission communication entitled ‘The European Union and Latin America: Global Players in Partnership’. I think it is difficult to find two regions that have more in common in terms of values and interests than Europe and Latin America. The figures, Madam President, are very well known: together, they have more than a billion citizens, account for more than 25% of global gross domestic product and, along with the Caribbean countries, include almost one third of the countries that make up the United Nations. It is also well known, although the figures show a slight decline, that the European Union is the main donor of development aid, the main investor in the region and the second largest trading partner in Latin America, and the largest in Mercosur and Chile. However, more importantly than the figures, we consider Latin America to be more than a market for Europe, and we therefore share a whole series of principles and values, which are pluralist and representative democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression, the constitutional state, the rule of law, respect for due process and the rejection of all forms of dictatorship and authoritarian rule. This summit, Mrs Ashton, comes at a very remarkable time in the calendar for the European Union and Latin America. It is a remarkable time for the European Union, because having gone through the reform process, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are a little engrossed in overcoming and contemplating our own problems, with the economic and monetary crisis. We have seen that, for the first time, the International Monetary Fund is not having to rescue a Latin American country, but a European Member State that is part of the Monetary Union. When we look at the European Union’s growth rates for last year, we see that, on average, we had a negative growth of 5%, while Latin America had a negative growth of 1.8%. When we look at the forecasts for growth for next year, we see that the European Union is expected to have an average growth of 0.7%, and Latin America of 5%. This means that the next summit is not going to be a North-South summit, like the previous summits, but a summit between equals. In that respect, I think that we should look back, if only briefly, and feel satisfied at what has been achieved in the last few years. It is clear, however, that a great deal still remains to be done. In that respect, Mrs Ashton, between 2000 and 2010, the European Union concluded association agreements with Mexico and Chile, but the United States concluded agreements with the whole of Central America, with Colombia and Peru, and also with various Mercosur countries. We therefore need to make up for lost time quickly, and in some way seek strategic partnerships with Mexico and Chile, apply the future developments clause in these agreements, and conclude the agreements with Central America, where we need to introduce greater measures of generosity. At the same time, Parliament welcomes the initiatives that you have put forward to establish the Europe-Latin America Foundation and also the financial investment facility. This summit is not, however, just another summit, Mrs Ashton. At this one, a very clear issue is going to be at stake. If we continue to lose our share of trade with the region, which has declined from 25% to just over 15% because of countries such as China, we are going to become irrelevant. Therefore, in line with the Spanish Presidency, I ask you, as High Representative and a Vice-President of the Commission, to send out a clear and very definite message regarding the commitment of this new Europe that we are building towards our old friends in Latin America. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their speeches. I would like to say to you, Mrs Ashton, that the fundamental element that will ensure that these relations move forward in the coming years will be the mobilisation of political will. Political reasons were behind the ministerial dialogue in San José in 1985; political reasons were behind the institutionalisation of the dialogue with the Rio Group in 1990; and political reasons were behind going over and above this in the summits mechanism. I would like to respond to Mr Kožušník by saying that we are indeed a community of values, and I would like to point out that in the last part-session, we adopted an important resolution on Cuba in which we called for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners. I would like to take this opportunity to ask Mrs Ashton to intercede on behalf of a dissident, Marta Beatriz Roque, who is on conditional release and is ill. She has just obtained Spanish nationality in a case promoted by a former MEP, Fernando Fernández Martín, so that she can come to Spain to be treated. However, we need to move from words to actions, and this is shown in the association agreements. I think, Mrs Ashton, that you have negotiated the agreements with Colombia and Peru very well. I think that although the human rights situation in Colombia still gives cause for concern, it has improved substantially. The Colombian people are clamouring for peace, and this agreement is definitely deserved. I also sincerely believe that a majority in Parliament is in favour of this agreement. Mrs Ashton, we need to give the Central Americans some room to breathe in the negotiations. We represent 25% of their exports, and they represent 2% of ours. We need to be generous and, as you said, we need to re-launch the agreement with Mercosur. To conclude, Mr President, I think that on the one hand, the European Union is in decline, in economic terms, and on the other, it is strengthened by the presence of the High Representative. Therefore, we need her to make a significant effort to demonstrate our political will at the Madrid Summit and to continue keeping relations with Latin America high on the European Union’s agenda.

Madam President, when my group asked for this matter to be included on the agenda, it did not do so in order to highlight errors, which are sometimes irreparable, in policies that indulge the enemies of freedom. It also did not do so in order to gain political return from this condemnation. It did so in order that Parliament, which is the institution at the democratic heart of the European Union, could speak out to condemn the death of an innocent person, and, above all, to express its solidarity with those in Cuba who are fighting, living and dying, like Orlando Zapata, for their freedom and their dignity. As the European Commission said, the Council’s common position is still valid, and it is an honourable position because it asks for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners. It is also a consistent position, because it asks for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be respected, in order for Cuba to be rooted in our system of values and not in foreign systems such as those of China or Vietnam. Madam President, the words of a brave man, Oswaldo Paya, who won the Sakharov Prize in 2002, still resound in this House. He said that the first victory to be proclaimed was that there was no hate in his heart. He said to those who oppressed him, who were his brothers, that he did not hate them, but that they were not going to impose their will through fear. He said that Andrei Sakharov left a legacy of dignity and of working towards peoples living together peacefully, and that often the voices that count the most are the voices that are not heard. In this House, we have not been able to hear the voices of the ‘Ladies in White’, 
who were also awarded the Sakharov Prize by Parliament. Now we will unfortunately not be able to hear the voice of Orlando Zapata, but soon we will be able to hear the voices of many more Cubans. In the meantime, Madam President, with the legitimacy that Parliament has in representing 500 million citizens from the 27 Member States of the Union, it needs to loudly and clearly echo the unstoppable shout of freedom that we are hearing from the beloved island of Cuba. (Applause) José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

Mr President, yesterday, during the debate on the motion for a resolution on which we are about to vote, we expressed our sorrow at the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a 42-year-old builder and Cuban political prisoner, who died after a hunger strike and many years of arbitrary, unjust, inhumane and cruel imprisonment. In this House yesterday, Commissioner Georgieva strongly and forcefully condemned this event. I am calling on you, Mr President, on behalf of Parliament, to send your condolences to Mr Zapata’s family, which is being harassed at his funeral. I would ask you to communicate to the Cuban authorities your strongest condemnation of this completely avoidable death, which the head of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, Elizardo Sánchez, described as a murder dressed up as justice. I hope, Mr President, that this death will lead to reflection among those who, out of good faith or naivety, want to change the Council’s common position, an honourable position that merely serves to link any improvement in relations with the island to human rights and fundamental freedoms, which, as we have seen, continue to be violated. (Applause) José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

Mr President, I think that this is an excellent opportunity to affirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights, which is what this motion for a joint resolution to be adopted tomorrow does. Parliament has expressed its opinion on several occasions, normally through the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World, and through various resolutions, as we did recently in the case of Iran. Some fellow Members have referred to the paradox – a word that they have used – of certain countries that have an extremely poor record on human rights being part of the body that is responsible for monitoring them, and I think that the case of Iran is one of the most obvious ones. This is not the only example, and I think that the United Nations will become ineffective if it is really resourced by these countries, and will lose all political legitimacy and moral authority to condemn these events. While I am talking about this, Mr President, this week, another of Parliament’s bodies has been considering the expulsion of a member of this House, the expulsion of Cuba. In addition, today we must mourn the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a 42-year old builder and political prisoner, who has died following a hunger strike and arbitrary, inhumane and cruel imprisonment. The Chair of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, Elizardo Sánchez, a person who is very close to the spirit of social democracy, has said that this death was entirely avoidable and that he considers it to be a murder dressed up as justice. Commissioner, I would like to ask you – as we already know the position of the President-in-Office – if you think, from an ethical and democratic point of view, in response to the deplorable events such as the death of Mr Zapata, and if the Commission thinks, that relations between the European Union and Cuba need to be raised to a higher level and given priority?

 Mr President, like my fellow Members, I also wish to congratulate Mr Füle on having taken office and I hope that the excellent impression he made in his Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing will be confirmed over the course of his mandate, particularly in the sensitive area of enlargement. I would like to say a few words about Turkey, firstly to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the excellent results obtained in the committee. Her report, which refers to 2008 and 2009, neither overstates nor underplays matters; it highlights the efforts Turkey is making to try to meet the Copenhagen conditions and criteria. In my view, however, these efforts need to be considered within Turkey’s current context and political situation: seven years of Mr Erdoğan’s moderate Islamic government, with elections expected in July 2011; a country that is seething from the Operation Sledgehammer cases; from the annulment of the Emasya Protocol, which handed major powers over to the military; and, in particular, from the ruling that has banned the activities of the Democratic Society Party in Turkey. This context, Commissioner, means that the Turkish case needs to be handled with great caution. Turkey has to meet the conditions and requirements of the Copenhagen criteria and, obviously, it has to comply with the Ankara Protocol. However, in this particular context and situation, it goes without saying, Commissioner, that if any wrong signal is sent out, it could have very serious consequences for the security of the European Union, especially when the governing party does not have the three-fifths majority it needs in parliament in order to modify the constitution; such a signal could seriously give rise to alarming turmoil in an already unstable country that is a strategic partner for the West, in the context of the Atlantic Alliance. We need to use the utmost caution in the negotiating process in order not to make any mistakes. José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra  (PPE

 Mr President, before we vote on this draft resolution on Iran, I merely wish to inform the Chamber that there has been an attempt to storm the Italian Embassy in Tehran and that similar incidents have also taken place at the embassies of other Member States, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Mr President, in Paragraph 24, this draft resolution calls for a European Union delegation to be established in Iran; my group would not want the adoption of this paragraph, which has been used in other European Parliament resolutions, to be taken as a sign of complacency with regard to these events. I would therefore ask Mr Füle to tell Mrs Ashton that the circumstances I have just mentioned should be borne in mind during the application of this resolution's mandate. I believe Mr Gahler is going to request the addition of an oral amendment to the resolution text so that the diplomatic interests of Member States can be protected in Iran.

Madam President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, I would first of all like to point out that the European Parliament has expressed its opinion on the situation of the prisoners in Guantánamo on various occasions through various resolutions. In his inauguration speech, President Obama said that he was making a commitment to close the Guantánamo detention centre within a year. This deadline passed on 22 January and the fact that it has not been closed is proof that often in politics it is easier to make promises than to keep them. Also, as the representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council said, President Obama’s personal representative has visited the European Union, met with our President and with several Member States and asked for our cooperation, which has to be offered on the basis of a series of premises mentioned by the Commissioner. One of these is that this is a problem created by the previous government of the United States, and that the European Union has to cooperate, but on the basis of certain requirements, in particular, the security of our Member States. In this respect, I would like to recall the decision made by some Member States, including the one that currently holds the Presidency of the Council, my own country. I would like to ask the representative of the Spanish Presidency if he is thinking of taking any additional measures to try to harmonise the response of the Member States to the problems that have arisen in Yemen in particular, or whether he is intending to leave this decision to the individual and sovereign context of each Member State, as decided by the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs. One final question, Madam President: it is indeed true that 100 out of the 190 or so prisoners that remain have been sent to their countries of origin or to third countries, and that 40 are going to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts. There are, however, still 50 that are not going to be released because there is not sufficient proof to take them into custody but the risk that they actually pose has forced the United States Government to decide that they should not be released. I would like to ask the Commission and the Council what they think about the situation of these 50 people who are not going to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts.

 Mr President, I would firstly like to say that the intergovernmental treaty was the only possible solution in an emergency situation. However, this treaty means a redistribution of sovereignty, a new social compact, and requires greater involvement on the part of the Commission and Parliament in order to give it legitimacy. What was the aim of these agreements? Two things, as President Van Rompuy has said. Firstly, to convince the markets that we want to continue together, that this is not a pegged exchange rate system that can be reversed at any time, and secondly, to stabilise the markets. I agree that, over the medium term, fiscal union was absolutely essential, because this crisis has been caused in part by government excess. However, it is not just the excesses of governments that have caused the crisis. Ireland and Spain had sound public finances and yet they are also in difficulties, because they were not competitive enough, because there was too much private indebtedness. This is why I place enormous importance on correcting macro-economic imbalances, which has gone somewhat unnoticed, and enormous importance on the issue of growth, which has gone unnoticed too. The uncertainty is greater with regard to stabilising the markets. I agree that we have corrected the private participation mistake: it was an error and we have put it right now. We have made a little progress on rescue mechanisms, but I am not sure that the provision made will be sufficient and that we will have the financing resources to make them effective. There are questions about leveraging the temporary mechanism and doubts about the permanent mechanism. Mr Barroso, I ask you to continue with the basket of bonds that, in my opinion, would be a good way of financing this fund. It would overcome the fragmentation in the debt market and make sovereign debt a risk-free asset once again. The European Central Bank will only act if it believes the summit will bring security, and we will see in the coming days whether it does or not. However, if it does not, it will have to seek alternative options, because we cannot go into battle against the crisis with one arm tied behind our backs. If the Member States have to insure against possible losses, then let them do so, but let us find a way of stabilising the markets that, may I say, are not doing well at all right now. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I think that, in order for this exercise to be useful, we should start by telling the truth. The truth is that we are not capable of resolving any of the problems that we have on the table: neither the problem of Greece, nor the problem of Italy. This incapacity to resolve these problems is affecting every economy in the European Union, it is rendering the efforts of Ireland and Portugal useless, and it is spreading contagion everywhere, including to Belgium and France. The truth is that the penalty for sovereign debt does not arise for economic reasons, because the foundations of our current account deficit are better than those of the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. Therefore, if it does not arise for economic reasons, it is because it arises only for political reasons. We have not succeeded in finding the right model, and we do not have the institutional structures to resolve the issue. Up to now, all the solutions that have been adopted – and many have been discussed – all those that have been accepted are based on a restrictive fiscal policy and a restrictive monetary policy; this simply has not worked. Now is probably the time to consider whether we should look at other models, for example the Anglo-Saxon model, which is based on a lighter fiscal policy and an ultra–accommodating monetary policy. Obviously we cannot import the model to the European Union exactly as it is. No state, except probably Germany, is in a position to boost public spending, lower taxes or borrow. The room for manoeuvre is very limited, and it will be necessary to submit to fiscal discipline. We can, however, do this at EU level, and that is what you are responsible for. What needs to be done? I think that in the first place the European Central Bank has to do much more that it is doing now. Since 2007, the Federal Reserve has increased its budget by 226%. The European Central Bank has increased its budget by 103%. The Bank of England has a volume of debt equal to 16% of the gross domestic product of the United Kingdom. That of the European Central Bank is only 2%. Secondly, a bailout fund will have to be put in place using Eurobonds – with joint responsibility until the Treaty is amended – but before 9 December. It will then be necessary to cater for growth using the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the project bonds, which are like the Loch Ness monster: we all talk about it but nobody has seen it. If that is not done, what Minister Tremonti said in Italy will happen: the Titanic will sink and it will take everyone with it, including the first class passengers. That is your responsibility. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

 Mr President, the fact that there was fumata bianca
 this morning is good news, albeit good news which I would like to clarify. The restructuring of the Greek debt is also good news, but we would do well to admit that we were wrong, because, under the initial conditions, Greece would never have been able to pay. If we had acted sooner, the Greek people would have suffered less and the cost of the bailout would have been lower. Recapitalisation of the banks: I need to look at it in detail, but I do not really understand why they have changed the criteria for evaluating sovereign debt, but have made no alteration to the evaluation of toxic assets, and I do not understand why they have set a ‘one size fits all’ rule for the limit on capital, thus establishing similar recapitalisation limits for financial institutions which, in fact, are not similar. The Spanish Government will have to explain the transfers that it has carried out, but that will be done at home. On the other hand, the Commission does have to explain to us here why we are facing a banking crisis without it having submitted the proposal for a directive on crisis resolution mechanisms, as it promised to do when we spoke about financial supervision. A new storm, and still the lifeboats are not ready. Lastly, it is good news that they are boosting the firepower of the bailout fund. It is just a shame that we have to look externally because we are incapable of sorting out our own problems internally, and we will only do so if we have a comprehensive plan that simultaneously addresses macro-economic discipline, debt sustainability and, above all, growth. It is time that the Commission came up with a universal plan and for us to get moving. If we have to amend the Treaties, well, let us do it, but we need to do it in stages, starting now. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

 Mr President, we are clearly in a serious situation that calls for all of us to be responsible. All of us, including the Council. The difference that separates us today from the Council is the issue of reverse qualified majority voting. We all know that the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) has not worked because the Member States have decided not to punish each other for any violation of budgetary discipline. Perhaps this is because they have read in the Gospel the quote that says, ‘Let he who is without sin cast the first stone’. What this Parliament wants – and this is what distinguishes it from the Council – is to put an end to this joyous camaraderie between governments, and replace a biased referee with an impartial one. The package is good and deserves to be voted through. When times are hardest, no one would ever consider saying that we have to spend more. What we are now doing is restoring budgetary discipline. However, when something is good it is not necessarily enough. The speeches we have heard today have shown several things. We all knew that the eurozone was not an optimum currency area. Everyone thought that the current institutional framework – a centralised monetary policy, a Stability and Growth Pact, and the coordination of the other economic policies – would enable the differences between Member States to be overcome, or at least reduced. That has not been the case. In the good times, their differences only increased; in the bad times, the pillars on which the monetary union was established were left in ruins. The ‘no-bailout’ principle, the ‘no-default’ principle, and now the ‘no-exit’ principle could also be out the window. We now find ourselves in Lenin’s ‘What is to be done?’ situation. The only solution is to move forward on the issue of political union. I welcome the issue of Eurobonds. It is a positive step in that direction, but more needs to be done. If establishing a political union requires reforming the Treaties by convening a convention, so be it. There is a Greek proverb that says, ‘rules are made for man, and not man for rules’. It is not a question of continuing trialogues until three o’clock in the morning or holding ministerial meetings at six o’clock in the morning. From now on let us think about what can be done to remedy this situation. The first step, however, is to vote in favour of this package, which is a good step in the right direction. Otherwise we will be making a futile effort and, as Mr Ortega y Gasset was just saying, futile effort leads to melancholy and – in politics – to opposition. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

Madam President, this issue raises a question, just one question: at European level what can we do to give work to those who do not  have it? To respond to that question I want to make clear the first agreed point. There can be no sustainable growth without a stable macroeconomy. Some of the quick solutions that have been proposed here, especially from the leftwing Members, would mean bread for today and hunger for tomorrow. The second agreed point is that Europe 2020 is a compendium of good intentions, it sounds good, but we have to move from contemplation to action. What are we going to do? How are we going to finance the proposed initiatives and actions? Is the ambition contained in the words of the 2020 Strategy compatible with the budgets cuts that have been announced? The third agreed point is that we need a complete picture if we are to set ourselves on the right path towards stable growth. To date this picture does not yet exist. What is currently happening in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council shows that among them there are a huge amount of scattered, incoherent and inconsistent ideas. There are three important actions to be taken. Firstly, stifling countries in difficulties cannot continue, and can be solved by a joint issuing of European bonds. Secondly, the bonds specified in the Monti Report have to be implemented, but they are not mentioned in the Europe 2020 Economic Strategy. Thirdly, we have to use the European Investment Bank’s resources, two thirds of which are the Commission’s, and which would only have to be increased fourfold in 10 years in order to equal the money that the Marshall Plan had for the reconstruction of the European economy. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
).

Mr President, anyone who reads the newspapers today will find out two things: that we are at a crucial point in the sovereign debt crisis, and that the European response is a succession of isolated provisions with no internal consistency. Even now, we have on the table the European Semester, the economic governance package, the provisional and permanent rescue strategy, the so-called ‘Eurobonds’ to cover part of the sovereign debt that is considered to be secure, plus an action plan based on the European Investment Bank and bonds for specific projects, which is in the proposal that the Commission sent us on the internal market. The first thing that the rapporteurs are trying to do is to combine all of this and create a complete design, a final picture to be shown to the public. Secondly, this design needs to be a European design that does not divide Europe in two – let us not stumble into a two-speed Europe – and that pursues two objectives with equal intensity: budgetary discipline – as much as is necessary – and economic growth to bring us out of the crisis that we are in. I have one comment regarding the rescue mechanism to which the President-in-Office of the Council was referring. In his first statement, he said that private investors would participate in the rescue plans, which caused shock and led to a protest by the President of the European Central Bank. It was explained, as Mr Van Rompuy did just now, that firstly, it would be case-by-case – who decides and based on what criteria? – and secondly, that it would be done according to the criteria and policies of the International Monetary Fund. The only case in which the International Monetary Fund has used this type of rescue plan was in Argentina in 2003; it plunged the country into chaos, from which it has still not emerged, and the private bondholders have still not been paid. Regarding Eurobonds, many issues have been set out here today. I would just like to add two more. It would create a market as liquid as that in the United States, and would give a boost to the euro as a reserve currency, enabling the central banks and sovereign funds to invest their reserves here. My final comment is that this needs to be complemented by the European Investment Bank and the specific bonds to respond to growth. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

Mr President, I am not going to emphasise what has already been said. The Belgian Presidency has been excellent. I would like to mention two highlights: financial supervision and the European Semester. Regarding these highlights, I would like to say what has been done and, most importantly, what needs to be done. In terms of financial supervision, in the space of 48 hours, the Minister, Mr Reynders, managed to get a dossier that was in deadlock moving, and we were able to give the Council and the Commission what the Commission had asked of us: European authorities that could begin operating on 1 January 2011: strong, authentically European authorities with clout. What happened next is not very reassuring. We still do not have presidents for the authorities; we have an extraordinarily small budget and I am told that the rewards for those who are going to hold positions in these authorities are not brilliant. They are, of course, much less brilliant than the bonuses received by bankers in London. There are two matters that still need to be dealt with: the regulation of the systemic bodies, and contributions and taxes on banking. In the regulation of systemic bodies, we want the European authority to be responsible for supervision, through the national authorities, which, in this case, would act as agents and would be subject to the instructions of the European authority. The alternative would not make sense. In terms of taxation, the most recent offering from Commissioner Šemeta sets out all the possible taxes for banks. Parliament has already adopted two contributions: the contribution to the coordinated guarantee funds and the contribution to the banking stability funds. This is a fact, and next we will be able to discuss the tax on banking or taxes on banking transactions, because, I stress, the rest is a fact. In terms of the European Semester, the only thing that we want is to coordinate with everything: with Eurobonds, with project bonds, with the mechanism, etc. … (The President cut off the speaker) José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

Madam President, what we need right now are clear rules, and what we are doing is precisely the opposite. I am therefore going to make a few proposals in order to re-establish clarity. In the European semester, Parliament wants to focus on a series of discussions, which are currently unfocused and do not fit with public opinion. We want the political responses to the recommendations made to the Member States over the next six months to be taken into account when establishing the penalties provided for in the legislative package on governance. My group would like to make it clear that there are no magic solutions in the legislative package for getting us out of the crisis. There are the well-known methods of budgetary discipline and structural reforms in order to maintain competitiveness. With regard to the crisis mechanism, as you said yesterday, Commissioner, President Barroso promised us here that it was going to be a European mechanism. Today the Council is proposing an intergovernmental mechanism. Is this European – in Mr Barroso’s terms – because it appears that the fund will be based in Europe rather than in the Cayman Islands, or does the Commission intend to help us to create a mechanism following EU procedure in which Parliament has a contribution to make? With regard to eurobonds, the Commission, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the experts say that it is a good idea, but that it is a premature idea, therefore we are late. What I propose to the Commission is that we begin a debate to shape a system of eurobonds that gives reasonable financing to the countries that do the right thing and punishes those that do not by forcing them to go to the markets at rates that are genuine deterrents. That is the only workable way of combining fiscal discipline and economic growth. Do not come back to me with discussions about whether it is too early or too late, because what we know now is that we have always been too late. Let us see if, for once, by changing the rules, we can be early. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

Madam President, Commissioner, the two block exemption regulations, one of which refers to specialisation agreements and the other to research and development, will expire on 31 December of this year. The Commission has drawn up two legislative proposals: two proposals for regulations that are before this House to replace the regulations that are now coming to an end. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since the initial regulations were adopted. There have been significant changes in legislation, especially the 2003 modernisation package, crucial legal judgments have been passed in this area and the Commission has learnt quite a lot from practice, which is also an important aspect. The Commission opened two rounds of consultations with those concerned, which is good practice in the spirit of legislating well and having public support. The big question now is as follows: what use is it going to make of the responses from those concerned during the consultation? Is it going to take notice of them or are these opinions simply going to be thrown in the bin? In this context, what Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs want to know is essentially six things. What are the suggestions and specific ideas that the stakeholders have put forward that the Commission is going to take into account when it comes to designing and defining these regulations and taking them from ‘the muses to the theatre’? Secondly, what does the Commission think about the horizontal agreements that are not covered by the exemption regulations on specialisation or research and development. What did the stakeholders say in this round of consultations? What would be the advantages from the point of view of industry, the real economy and protecting competition, of proposing new regulations to take into account horizontal agreements that are not covered by the two block exemption regulations that we are currently considering? Does the Commission intend to draw up new regulations to cover them? Yes or no? The question is relatively clear. The third problem that was debated at length in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is the subject of what is known as ‘patent ambush’, which, as the Commissioner is aware, takes place when one of the stakeholder companies that is participating in establishing standards withholds information on the patents that it holds or the patents that it is planning to register in future. This causes serious damage and inconvenience to those companies that are unaware of that information and commit to acting according to the parameters established. The question here is relatively specific as this is a case of distortion of competition and barriers in the internal market, which is the cardinal sin in our institution: does the Commission intend to tackle the problem of ‘patent ambush’ in the framework of the new draft regulations, or otherwise, does it consider that complementary sector-specific legislation would be necessary to avoid abuse of patent rights? Is the Commission committed to ensuring that there is an integrated, consistent legislative framework without internal contradictions between competition rules and sector-specific legislation in the area of intellectual property rights? The fourth and fifth questions relate to economic governance or, if you prefer, governance of competition. We have learnt that we need to try to converge with other competition authorities and, in this respect, it is important to know to what extent the Commission, in drawing up these regulations, has made use of court decisions and the decisions of national and international authorities. The last question refers to a subject that is a particularly sensitive one for my committee, and I am sure that Mr Schwab will have something to say about it. It refers to the marketing chain for food products. It seems obvious that there is inequality in conditions among producers, between farmers, on the one hand, and large chains, on the other. Does the Commission intend to do something to guarantee equal, fair treatment for the weaker party in this contract? These are the questions, Commissioner, that I would like to you to answer as fully, clearly and precisely as possible. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, today is a good day for Europe. In December, we had a poor agreement and now, thanks to the cooperation between Parliament, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, we have a good agreement. It is a good agreement that is going to establish genuinely European authorities that are strong and subject to the democratic control of Parliament: authorities that are going to be designed to ensure that all the banks are subject to the same rules across the European Union. They will be able to impose their decisions on the national supervisory bodies and, if they do not comply with them, on the private banks, in order to protect families and businesses. This will enable them to combat the banks that could cause systemic risks and prevent taxpayers from having to pay once again for the irrational exuberance of some financial institutions. The lesson that we can learn from this debate is that Parliament is not like a dog whose bark is worse than his bite that will back down at the slightest gesture from the Council: it holds firmly to its positions. Nor is it a dog in the manger: it is a good ally of the Council and the Commission for moving forward in the process of European integration. Thanks to my fellow Members, Commissioner Barnier and Mr Reynders, we now have an excellent agreement on which we should congratulate ourselves. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

 Madam President, on behalf of my group – and I believe on behalf of all the rapporteurs – I am going to request that, within the following reports that make up this package – the Giegold report, the Goulard report, my own report and the Skinner report – the amended Commission proposal be put to a roll-call vote. It is important to know that Parliament has the level of mandate that we have to negotiate with the Council. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

Madam President, I would like quite simply to thank the other rapporteurs, as we have worked together in an exemplary manner on what was a difficult package: we had before us a Council agreement that had been approved unanimously. Parliament now has a mandate that was also approved practically unanimously, with the enormous advantage that the winds are blowing in Parliament’s direction and not that of the Council’s text, which now seems extraordinarily archaic. Thank you to my group, thank you to all of the groups, and thank you to Parliament, which has won an important victory today. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,

 Madam President, Cassandra had a gift: that of telling the future. She also bore a curse: that of not being listened to. For this reason, Troy fell. Parliament anticipated more than 10 years ago that liberalising the markets, without putting in place European supervision mechanisms at the same time, would lead to a crisis in the system, for one very simple reason: cross-border institutions cannot be supervised by national authorities whose jurisdiction ends at their borders. They can only be supervised by European authorities. We did not take heed of this, and the crisis erupted. Exotic products, unknown even to their creators, flooded the markets. Nobody trusted anybody else, nobody lent to anybody else, and credit dried up. The result: 23 million unemployed and EUR 3.5 billion – one third of our production – committed to aid the financial sector. Now what? We in Parliament have been at odds with the Council for some days now. Parliament has given a great deal of ground in order to reach an agreement; the Commission too. The Belgian Presidency has shown great willing. It has asked us for time. We are going to give it time, but let us show today that Parliament is united, that it has very clear ideas. For this reason, let us vote massively in favour tomorrow of the amendments that the most influential groups within this House have put forward jointly. There are several ideas that Parliament would like to highlight. The first is that the crisis will only be overcome when confidence recovers and transparency is re-established within markets, institutions and products. This will only be possible when there are European supervision authorities that are credible, strong, independent and subject to democratic control: authorities that are not limited to meekly repeating the slogans emanating from national governments. What does it mean to say that they are European? It means that they must have real power to ban the sale of toxic products; it means that they have real power to put an end to the regulatory distortions that prevent the market from working; it means that they must have real power to require national supervisors to always operate in defence of European interests. National supervisors cannot be feudal lords invested with absolute power. The European authority must ensure that the law is obeyed, that national authorities do what they need to do when there is a threat of pandemic, and that they are able to resolve conflicts when colleges of supervisors do not want to do so, or cannot. They need to be able to require private institutions that are offside to do what they need to do when national colleges of supervisors notice any omissions within the European guidelines. The second lesson is that, among cross-border institutions, there is a special, singular type: those known as systemic institutions. An elementary truth about capitalism is that when it is done well, money is made, and when it is done badly, money is lost. This governs everything except systemic institutions. When things are going well, they make a fortune, and when things are going badly, it is the taxpayer who has to run to their aid. To resolve the problem of systemic institutions, there are only two solutions, only two: either supervisors within the countries where they operate are given greater powers to control their solvency and liquidity, which would lead to the removal of the European Parliament from the equation, or truly European institutions are put in place, which is what this House is proposing. This means that European authorities need to watch over these institutions with particular zeal, as their ruin will be the ruin of all. It means that the European institution needs to be provided with resolution and control mechanisms for stabilising endangered institutions, if this is possible, or to wind them up, if this is not possible. Lifeboats should be made ready before the voyage, not in the middle of a storm. Also, these systemic institutions need to be required to pre-finance, to provide funds for guaranteeing the interests of depositors, which is our main concern, and for paying the costs of a crisis when it occurs. What cannot happen is for the taxpayer to have to carry the can again. What cannot happen, as the Americans say so often, is for ‘Main Street’ to have to pay for the excesses of ‘Wall Street’ again. I would ask the ladies and gentlemen of the Council who are absent today – they have been very active this morning, talking on the telephone, and it seems that the storm has passed and things are calm, and they are still not here – to convey the same message through the Commissioner. The Council has asked for time. Parliament has given it time. Let nobody be confused, however: this is not a sign of weakness. This is a sign of the strength of this House. The strength of a body that believes in what it says, and feels that it has the support of the public, who back it. The Council and the Commission, which is doing a magnificent job, needs to make use of this time to forge a parliamentary consensus on the European direction, in the direction of Europe. It must not make use of this time to try and put together blocking minorities in opposition to Parliament. I ask the Council to listen to Cassandra for once. Today, Cassandra is the rapporteurs who have spoken. Cassandra is also Commissioner Barnier. Those who are not Cassandra know only too well to whom I refer. Listen to Parliament, seek an agreement, say here what was said in Toronto. Do not say one thing here and another there. As old Castilians say, if the Council does this, God will reward it, and if not, God will demand it. God and this House. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, please inform the Council that there is a convergence of opinions in this House that is rarely seen. The Council must take note: for six months, it has been telling us that it had a fixed mandate from the Swedish Presidency, and now we also have a mandate. While we are talking about Cassandra, the important thing is not to prophesise the past, which is what the Spanish Presidency did, but to prophesise the future, which is what the Belgian Presidency seems to want to do. We have a consensus that is just as strong as the one within the Council, with an added advantage, which is that the winds favour Parliament’s stance and do not favour the old and anachronistic stance that the Council maintained up until the start of the Belgian Presidency. We have the advantage that we incorporated proposals that had been rejected; proposals that were in the de Larosière report, such as the resolution mechanisms to which Mrs Ferreira has referred. It makes no sense to put in place a supervisor that can forecast the weather but cannot do anything in the case of shipwreck. We have the advantage that we anticipated things that other institutions said later. When we talked about systemic institutions, we were told that there was no such species; the European Council acknowledged its existence in March. When we talked about how the taxpayer should not have to bear the cost of the crisis and that pre-financed funds should be established by the sector for facing up to its responsibilities, we were told that this was premature, utopian or simply idiotic. Then, the Europe 2020 strategy adopted by the Commission said it, Ecofin said it, the European Council said it and took it to Toronto, and I would not understand why they are not advocating it now.

Mr President, I would like to talk about financial supervision, which is the only real tangible manifestation of this ethereal idea that we call economic governance, and I must say that we are in a real ceremony of confusion. Just this morning, the rotating President of the Union declared that we are close to an agreement. He urged us to get moving, and both these statements are economical with the truth. We are not close to an agreement, and it is also not the job of the Presidency of the Council to tell the rest of us to get moving. What it needs to do is to get itself moving, and I will tell you in which direction it needs to go. The Council agreement is, as has been said here, an agreement of minimums; it is an agreement that is wanted by some European authorities whose only competences are to propose technical harmonisation rules for a standard interpretation of European law. There was no need to go to so much trouble. This could have been done by the Commission with Article 290, based on the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, which is in force. What Parliament has said is as follows: firstly, that pan-European banks must be supervised by a genuinely European authority that is strong and subject to control by Parliament; secondly, that the banks whose collapse could drag us all down should be subject to special vigilance; thirdly, that when one of these banks gets into difficulties, the banking authority should have a toolbox to prevent infection, restructure the bank and liquidate it in an orderly fashion without the debris landing on the taxpayers’ heads; and fourthly, that there should be two funds pre-financed by the sector itself, in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, so that we do not end up all paying once again for what Crispin charitably called the irrational exuberance of a few. Mr Barroso, the first time that I saw a high representative of the Spanish Government was on Monday. Before the start of the Spanish Presidency, they were given ...

Madam President, I am going to keep to my time limit and be very specific. I am going to tell the Council and the Commission exactly what they need to do in a week’s time if they want an agreement on the financial package. The major premise is that the future is looking brighter than it was a while ago, but there are still some clouds on the horizon. According to the International Monetary Fund, USD 800 billion are owed in losses not disclosed by the banks, and the international bank has lent USD 2.2 billion to southern economies that are at risk. The reform of the financial markets needs to happen now, because what is important is not that there might be a crisis – which there might be – but that we have put the measures in place to navigate it. The second premise is that there are significant disagreements between the Council and Parliament with regard to the European supervision package. Parliament wants the entities that could cause the system to collapse and endanger the real economy to be supervised more strictly by a genuinely European authority. That is economic governance. We also want mechanisms to be established now to remodel the entities that could cause the whole system to collapse. This is not about rescuing them, but about remodelling them and, if necessary, liquidating them without spreading the infection or rescuing them as a result, as it is always the same people who pay for this. Thirdly, the ‘polluter pays’ principle requires the sector to establish a fund to pay the costs of the crisis. The Council has a week to do what the Larosière report said and to reach an agreement in Parliament; if not, the rotating Presidency of the Council will be entirely responsible. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, we know a number of things. We know that this crisis has been like a mutating virus: it began as a property crisis, later becoming a banking crisis, then an economic crisis, and ended up as a sovereign debt crisis that could bring other crises in the sector in its wake. We also know that this crisis has been very expensive. According to your services, aid commitments to the financial sector total EUR 3.5 billion: in other words, one third of the EU’s gross domestic product. We also know that one of the root causes of the crisis was the lack of transparency in products, institutions and markets. That is why the report that we are discussing at the moment is so important. However, if you want a statistic, I would remind you that in the United States alone, in the years 2000-2006, asset-backed securities increased by a factor of four and mortgage-backed securities by a factor of seven; moreover, in a very recent court appearance, the advisors of a reputable bank said that they did not have a very good idea of what they were selling. We also know – and this is the third statement – that many of the commitments that we made at the G20 have not gone, to quote a Spanish poet, ‘from the Muses to the theatre’ – they have not gone from imagination to the written word. We also know that throughout this remodelling of the financial sector, there are three principles which I see as key: Pan-European entities must be supervised by pan-European authorities; we must have the necessary measures at our disposal to detect the virus and avoid infection; and, finally, we must prevent the public from having to pay by itself for those infections that it has not caused. Commissioner, you have a major job to do if we do not want the next crisis to catch us with our pants down. I will end by saying in French that I recommend ‘de l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace
’ in your mission – boldness, more boldness and forever boldness. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

 Mr President, I am going to try to say two new things on the subjects with which the European Council has been dealing: the 2020 strategy and the regulation of the financial markets. As regards the 2020 strategy, all of us here have been saying for quite some time that one of the reasons for the relative failure of the Lisbon Strategy was that there were not enough tools to oblige Member States to honour their commitments. Now the Commission and the European Council are coming to us with a proposal that is more of the same: a weak agreement that makes reference to Articles 121 and 136 of the Treaty. The President-in-Office of the Council began the Spanish Presidency by saying that he was aware of this weakness and that he wanted more: that he wanted to strengthen economic governance. I ask you now, Mr President of the European Council: ‘Where are the courtly gallantries? The deeds of love and high emprise, In battle done?’ What has happened to these intentions? As regards financial regulation, I have one piece of bad news and two of good news. The bad news is that the Council has decided to delay the regulation of alternative investment funds – known as casino capitalism – at precisely the time when these funds have been partly responsible for the speculation on the Greek economy. The first piece of good news is that the 2020 strategy talks about obliging financial institutions to put money aside to pay for some of the plates they smash; or, as President Obama would put it, to avoid Main Street having to pay for the damage caused by Wall Street. The second is that for the first time the Council is singling out the systemic institutions to which it wishes to pay particular attention. These two things feature in the reports that Parliament is currently debating. They do not feature in the agreement that the Council reached in December. I would like to see the Council taking these two ideas up again, because then we will be much closer to playing ball. Believe me, Mr President, I am really keen to play ball with the Council that you are chairing. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
).  
– (ES)
 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are more aware than anyone of how my party wanted to help make the Spanish Presidency a success. We want to continue doing so, but for that you need to make some adjustments and you need to get on with leading the Union right away. Leading the Union means seeking a solution for Greece. Everyone has said so and I am not going to repeat it. Leading the Union means approving the Directive on alternative investment fund managers as soon as possible and not delaying it, which is what the Spanish Presidency has done. Leading the Union means approving the financial surveillance package as soon as possible, not upholding at all costs a Council agreement that is much more conservative than the Commission’s proposal and even more so than the de Larosière report from which it derives. Parliament will provide the Spanish Presidency with a supervision agreement that can be summarised in two words: more supervision and more Europe. I am sure that the Spanish Government, which has always preached these ideas, will support Parliament and not the other positions that originate from the other side of the Channel. Leading the Union means strengthening budgetary discipline, and strengthening budgetary discipline means coming up with new ideas to strengthen the preventive aspect. The Spanish Prime Minister knows that the review of the fourteen stability plans that have just been referred to was a purely bureaucratic procedure in the absence of a better idea. The preventive arm would have to take into account the competitiveness of the economies – because without wealth, there is no way of balancing the public accounts – and it would have to take the foreign account situation into consideration. Tougher sanctions would also have to be implemented so that the agreement really appears binding. Leading the Union means bringing in a new idea on the issue of governance, on which you have just written in a newspaper. The Spanish Prime Minister told us here how he wanted more governance when Articles 121 and 136 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which are the ones to which the Spanish Presidency now refers, are already in force. What else does it involve? Tell us what it involves and we will help you. In order to help you, however, we need to know what it is you expect and want, because in this House, vague, vacuous and empty ideas get very short shrift. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE

Madam President, we are here for the first time in the history of the euro to talk about the financial situation of a handful of countries. I am emphasising the word ‘countries’, because the Spanish Presidency sounded like it was talking about outer space, and Commissioner Almunia only mentioned Greece. I would like to know whether the Commissioner continues to maintain in his closing speech that the problems of Spain and Portugal are similar to those of Greece and if so, what he would do about it. However, we are here to talk about these financial situations because the finances of a few could ruin the credibility of the currency of all and open the door to a two-speed Europe. The gap could increase when the exit strategy referred to by the Spanish Presidency is implemented, because we could find that the less developed countries have to deal with monetary difficulties and harsher monetary policies and, more importantly, have to use much more money to pay off debts and much less money to create employment. Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, without a sustainable economy, it will be impossible to balance finances. Without employment, tax revenue will continue to fall and unemployment benefit payouts will continue to rise. We are facing a crisis of confidence, and when there is a crisis of confidence, the first thing we have to do is tell the truth. We have to say how we have ended up here. What are the affected countries doing to get themselves out of debt? Are the stability pacts credible or not? Above all, we need to know what they are doing to straighten out their economies, because as I said before, without sustained growth, there will not be a sustainable economy or sustainable finances. José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with many of the points that have been made, but must qualify some others. I agree that it is too soon to take away the patient’s crutches, but that it is time to get him ready to walk without them. We still have to absorb excess liquidity in the markets, correct the imbalance in public finances and re-establish respect for competition rules. In Pittsburgh we must do several things that we cannot do alone: we have to set up early warning mechanisms that work, because those that we had did not work; we have to revise the regulatory framework, because the existing framework has not worked. I agree that it is important to regulate bonuses and tax havens. These are all necessary, but inadequate, measures. In my opinion, it is more important to re-build the muscle of financial institutions, limit debt and set up reserves in good times so that we can weather the bad times. It is more important to make an effort in terms of supervision. The Commissioner knows that I supported the de Larosière report, although I felt it was inadequate, because I would support more centralised supervision. However, it is clear that European supervision cannot function without close coordination with the supervisory authorities of the other major economic areas of the world. We also need to do something about trade. It is all well and good helping the emerging countries, but it is more important to lift the barriers that are still preventing trade in goods. Commissioner, the most important point is that we need to establish the foundations for stable and sustained growth over a generation. For this we need free markets, markets open to innovation, markets open to entrepreneurs, but also markets subject to a certain level of regulation. I will end with a quotation, which will be familiar to my compatriot Mr Almunia: ‘Publish not many edicts; when you do enact pragmatics and decrees, see that they be good ones and, above all, that they are well observed’, so said Don Quixote to his friend Sancho. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again the defence of the general interest by the Commission and Parliament is clashing with entrenched national self-interest in the Council. Given the prior acceptance of the legitimacy of both positions, it is essential to find a balance. There is absolutely no doubt as to the relevance of the next multiannual financial framework. The Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and I, on its behalf, must reiterate that the Presidency’s proposal is, in our opinion, unacceptable. A cut of EUR 75 billion in relation to what was already an inevitably meagre proposal from the European Commission is futile and of no use to anyone. That is not the only problem: these new direct cuts in the agricultural and cohesion policies go beyond the ‘red line’ that Spain drew at the start of this work. Ladies and gentlemen, now is not the time to debate a supposed dichotomy between austerity and growth. Some of us are making clear efforts and sacrifices to correct our deficit. Spain, however, like so many other countries, needs to grow, increase its economic activity and create jobs. With this budget, none of this will be possible; it is pushing us past breaking point. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot achieve more Europe with far fewer resources, especially if what we have is distributed unfairly. If that is the case, Spain will oppose a multiannual financial framework for the European Union that means, plain and simple, the end to any opportunities for growth and, above all, any remnant of solidarity, and that is precisely the direction that the European Council is taking. Luckily, that is not the path that the Commission has chosen, and I must thank it for its efforts to adapt a different approach. In relation to this point – the need for the Union, the need for combined efforts – I want to thank Mr Barroso who, the other day in Cadiz, made a convincing declaration regarding the interpretation of the Treaties in the case of any potential secession within the Union.  He stated clearly and unequivocally, as guardian of the Treaties, that if part of a Member State secedes and becomes an independent state it will be dealt with as a third country and, therefore, it will be in no way affected by the statements and the effects of the Treaty. I hope, Mr President, that this can be recognised and that the Commission’s sure and steady approach can remain alive as a guarantee for us all. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Eppink that he has just used the little time he had to dish out words of insult and condemnation from a position of absolute ignorance.  Is he familiar with the Spanish Constitution? Because all Vice-President Vidal Quadras said – nothing more and nothing less – was that the provisions of the Spanish Constitution should be enforced; anything else was merely the personal comments of an individual, which had no bearing on anything and which I respect as such, but with which I do not agree. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is an old principle that has passed from the legal to the political world and it is ‘pacta sunt servanda
’, which means ‘agreements must be kept’.  By that, I am referring to the important measures adopted by the European Council in June to put an end to the crisis in which we find ourselves. Since these agreements were adopted, market pressure has eased, with markets welcoming decisions capable of breaking the vicious circle between banks and sovereign debt, as well as plans to move towards a genuine economic and monetary union and the commitment to defend the euro at all costs.  Ladies and gentlemen, the European Council held last week undeniably achieved some positive results: satisfactory progress was made towards a banking union, while the agreement between the 27 Member States on the creation of a single supervisory mechanism is also to be welcomed; and it is right that this task should be entrusted to the euro area finance ministers. However, I must criticise the biased interpretations that have, unilaterally, been made in this respect. It is not acceptable to make personal interpretations that could misrepresent the mandate granted to the finance ministers, nor do we approve of describing as settled matters that were not even discussed.  We urgently need to move towards a real single supervisory mechanism that covers all financial institutions. A joint deposit guarantee scheme and a crisis resolution mechanism must also be implemented. The euro’s survival depends on the rapid creation of an effective banking union. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, it has been said that, in order for things to get better, sometimes the chaos needs to get worse. The feeling of powerlessness was such that Europe was forced to react, and it did so for the good of everyone, because the big winner of this summit was the euro. This triumph has revived the hope that Europe is emerging from its paralysis, moving from thought towards action. Ladies and gentlemen, it was essential to adopt short-term measures at this summit, in order to guarantee financial stability, along with long-term measures, in order to solve the Union’s shortcomings. In this case, immediate action was essential in order to continue working towards what is important. The imperative result was to send a message that the euro is a joint, irrevocable and irreversible project. Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome such important decisions as giving the European Stability Mechanism the facility to recapitalise banks directly, which will break the vicious circle between banking debt and sovereign debt; incidentally, the current Spanish Government has always advocated this theory. It will also help in terms of intervening in markets to support the public debt of the countries that are fulfilling their public deficit and reform commitments. These decisions were necessary in order to guarantee financial stability, which must be the European Union’s highest priority in the short term. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the time for some countries to resort to nationalist maxims and throw up obstacles. As I have already said, it is the time to support Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, Spain is providing and implementing, in record time, the most ambitious reform agenda in the history of Spanish democracy, which includes major employment reforms. It is also carrying out a financial reform, based on complete transparency, all of which demonstrates its commitment to fiscal consolidation and hitting its deficit targets. We also welcome the decision to launch a process for greater economic integration, using four building blocks: banking union, fiscal union, a common economic policy framework and enhanced democratic legitimacy. Mr President, the history of first the Community and then of the European Union has always shown that, not only do we overcome crises, but also we emerge from them stronger. I am delighted that, once again, we have achieved this. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, the first thing I should say is that the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) approves of and supports the two packages that have been presented today, both the employment package and the solidarity aid for Greece, which is consistent with your overall proposal. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no denying that we are experiencing difficult times, and daily events remind us that the crisis is still far from over. Unavoidably, the focus has shifted back to Spain. Alarm bells have been ringing in the markets, without justification, partly fuelled by statements that I consider to be inappropriate, Mr President. Some of those have been made in the context of important elections, in which opponents on both sides are making my country a dialectical element of their confrontation. Naturally, we do not welcome any of these references. Furthermore, as a way of turning the attention away from their own problems, others are showing little political sensitivity in their dealings with us. Today in Parliament, some have failed to show any finezza
, as the Italians would say, and there has been a lack of political tact. Ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the markets does not reflect Spain’s strength. We are a solvent country and we are entirely capable of tackling our debts. The Spanish debt remains below the European average, and the Spanish Government is fully committed to fulfilling the deficit targets agreed with the EU. Mr Swoboda, Mr Rajoy has never said that he cannot meet the targets set by the European Union. On the contrary, he said that he is ready to meet each and every one of those targets, and he repeats that on a daily basis. The Spanish Government, in the few months it has been in office, has adopted, and will continue to adopt, very ambitious measures in order to guarantee fiscal consolidation and lay the foundations for greater competitiveness, job creation and growth. In the outlook it made public yesterday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) itself admitted that the forecast was made prior to any analysis of the decisions and measures currently being taken by the Spanish Government. We have adopted other measures: the general State budget for 2012, which we believe will guarantee that we will meet the deficit target this year; the organic law on budgetary stability; a reform of the education and health care systems, which will be presented this month and allow for an adjustment of EUR 10 billion; and the reform of the financial sector, which is going to help the financial institutions to bring in more than EUR 50 billion. In short, Spain is meeting the targets set by the Commission, and we are calling on everyone to be responsible. We all need to find a way out of this together, Spain with everyone else, without a doubt; the criticisms being made are not at all helpful. Either all the countries find a way to act together to bring about growth and a new direction, or else it will be difficult for us to move forwards under the conditions proposed by the Commission.

 Mr President, Mr Romeva, would you like Mr Rajoy to speak in Parliament? I think that is a good idea, and I would have no objections. Mr Rajoy, however, is not the protagonist of this crisis. The protagonist of the crisis is the legacy left behind by the socialist, communist and green left-wing parties in Spain, who handed over the worst legacy in political history, and this was after they had been handed the best legacy ever left by any previous government.

Madam President, Commissioner Kallas, I would like to begin by saying that if this issue has seemed easy, if it is reaching a successful conclusion, it is due in great part to the dedicated, rigorous and flexible position of the rapporteur, Mr Fleckenstein. I would like to thank him, on behalf of my group, for being flexible enough to accept our points of view and getting us to the point where we almost have a consensus. Ladies and gentlemen, the history of the European Maritime Safety Agency is a success story. Day after day, it justifies its existence and the reason for its existence. The amendment to the regulation establishing EMSA does not seek to rectify errors; on the contrary, it aims to extend the agency’s competences in the light of new challenges and the emergence of new problems, and we believe that EMSA is the appropriate instrument for tackling and resolving those problems. Parliament wants to make sure that EMSA does not turn into a body with a life of its own, but continues to be guided by the Commission and continues to intervene at the request of the Commission itself or the Member States. The serious accident in the Gulf of Mexico has shown us that EMSA should be entrusted with helping the states to investigate accidents involving maritime, coastal or offshore installations. On a separate note, it is important to emphasise EMSA’s role in supporting the monitoring of the organisations recognised as classification societies, particularly as regards ensuring mutual recognition. It should be noted that the agency plays a key role in Port State Control and the fight against piracy. For the first time, the report makes explicit reference to the agency’s work involving the satellite-based monitoring of fishing vessels and ships fishing in dangerous waters, for example, through its close collaboration with Operation Atalanta. It is vital to comply with the environmental strategy and support EMSA assistance when necessary. As regards the composition of the Administrative Board, I believe that there should be a gender balance and that this should be stated in a recital. I think that it would be excessive to introduce it in an article. I also believe that it would be feasible to promote maritime training and exchanges of good practices among institutions and schools. We will not support the European network of training academies as each Member State has its own special characteristics and needs. Finally, Madam President, regretfully we have to vote against Amendments 18 and 41 because the aim is to exclude the word ‘national’. That is something that is neither ingenuous nor innocent. No one and no state, especially in these times when we are giving up sovereignty in return for economic efficiency, is prepared to accept that the word ‘national’, the existence of the states, should not be compatible, as indeed it should, with the existence of the Union of 27, soon to be 28.

Madam President, Commissioner, as you know, in 2008, Parliament roundly rejected the motion for a resolution that was presented to it. Later, in the same terms, the report that I myself presented to the Chamber was approved by a comfortable majority, with a great consensus and with the effort of the Commission and the political groups. What were the reasons behind Parliament’s change of mind? Undoubtedly, seeing that all the requirements involved in accepting the use of these scanners were fulfilled, including the preservation of fundamental rights and, among these, in particular, the passenger’s dignity and privacy, non-discrimination, protection of personal data and protection of health. In this way, we established what type of scanners were suitable for guaranteeing passengers’ security, on the one hand, and preserving their rights in full, on the other. The scanners will not use ionising radiation, they will not be mandatory for Member States, nor for citizens, and they will all protect the rights described above. True, the Commission has captured all of these concerns in its proposed legislation but, in addition to scanners that use stick figures, it includes the possibility of another type which, whilst guaranteeing the same catalogue of rights, permits the inspection of an image of the passenger, albeit blurred. We accept the reasons why it has proven necessary to include this alternative as an authorised method of control. Parliament also defends the need to guarantee fair competition and thus avoid any monopolistic temptation. However, today we call on the Commission to retain all the precepts that we defended in my report, all the guarantees of preservation of fundamental rights. Moreover, we encourage it to work with industry and the Member States in order to ensure that in the near future, only automatic protection scanners are used and that no inspector is needed to view any image.

 I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Fidanza, for an excellent report and for his good work in bringing on board the many ideas that have been put forward in this House to make European tourism a key asset of our economy. Tourism constitutes one of the Union’s largest sources of revenue, and in my country, Spain, it is essential to have a sound tourism policy that continues to attract tourists from across the world and helps to foster economic growth at a time of crisis. The European Parliament has, for the first time, expressed itself politically on this subject, and it has done so by supporting the work of the Commission, but also by setting forth new ideas that enrich future tourism policy following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon. It is not a question of harmonising, as this is precluded by Article 195 of the Treaty, but of supplementing national policies to improve service quality, to couple the ‘Europe brand’ with national brands, and to create budget lines that reinforce national policies. With a view to countering seasonality in the sector, I have helped boost the role of social tourism, paying particular attention to tourism for the elderly on the basis of the Spanish experience. I considered it fundamental to support small and medium-sized enterprises and to develop entrepreneurship in the industry, as a driving force for employment. The goal is to consolidate Europe’s image and visibility as a collection of sustainable, quality destinations, and to foster the competitiveness of the European tourist industry. In a global world where new markets are emerging, Parliament has an undeniable opportunity to maintain Europe’s status as the primary tourist destination in the world and to contribute to economic growth by bringing different cultures closer together. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 Mr President, we are all part of a whole, and nobody can survive alone. This emergency requires a joint effort and sacrifice. It is now being demanded that the Union show leadership, and that the mechanisms for governing and decision-making function in real time. The monetary union cannot survive without unambiguous political leadership. It needs economic governance, a common budget, a certain level of fiscal harmonisation and an emergency plan. Therefore, we first need to regulate public accounts, correct macroeconomic imbalances and stimulate competitiveness. No country should spend more than its economic growth allows. On the other hand, the intergovernmental nature of the financial stability mechanism is regrettable. The European Union needs a permanent crisis resolution mechanism under the Community method: a European Monetary Fund. If Europe wants to see leadership, ladies and gentlemen, then those decisions must be driven by Parliament and the Commission, rather than by the Council, which is hindered and slowed down by the national governments. It is the responsibility of Member States to do their homework in order to help with the decisions of the Union as a whole, and to do all they can to succeed in this vital task: achieve economic growth and create employment. More than one year ago in Spain, the leader of the Popular Party, Mr Rajoy, expressed his support in the Spanish Parliament for a specific amendment to our constitution. Moreover just last week, the Spanish Parliament and Senate reached an agreement on the matter, after Prime Minister Zapatero gave his formal support. The commitment to cleaning up public accounts cannot be an interim measure, ladies and gentlemen; it has to be permanent. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 This report on audit policy, as its title states, aims to analyse lessons from the crisis. Given that one of the causes of that crisis was a loss of trust, which is the most important value for developed economies, with this resolution the European Parliament is proposing to strengthen that trust by means of auditing companies. This report is the result of a convergence of opinions; these may have been divided at the outset, but they have succeeded in establishing clear rules to strengthen the role of auditors. Nevertheless, instead of changing the market structure by penalising some of the major companies, the decision was taken to guarantee free competition and give greater support to small and medium-sized enterprises so that they can establish themselves in the market. On that point, may I congratulate Mr Masip Hidalgo for the work he has carried out in the Committee on Legal Affairs. This is an ambitious report that is going to require considerable development in order to accommodate everything that has been suggested. There were many lessons to be learned from the crisis, and this is a clear example of Europe’s will to draw the necessary impetus from the crisis in order to implement the mechanisms able to restore faith in the global economy. Audit policy is one of those. Luis de Grandes Pascual,

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is an honour to defend this own-initiative report. While it was initially intended that it would be limited to security scanners, the recent increase in terrorist activity demanded that the report go further. As a result, the Committee on Transport and Tourism unanimously agreed to make me the rapporteur so as to ensure that the report would take an integral view of civil aviation security. In keeping with that mandate, the report assesses security scanners, the decisions adopted regarding liquids, aerosols and gels, and security measures on cargo and mail. Transport security, ladies and gentlemen, is one of the main concerns in the fight against terrorism. Currently, Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 describes the different aspects which are included in the points of this report. In the area of security scanners: as is set out in the explanatory statement, this report derives from the Commission’s 2008 draft regulation. This proposal, if you recall, was rejected by Parliament for not demonstrating that it fulfilled a series of requirements such as respect for fundamental rights, safeguarding health and protecting passenger data. Therefore, the Commission has resolved, and I hope it will continue to do so, all the doubts that Parliament raised and which I have identified and dealt with in this report. With regard to the protection of fundamental rights, the new-generation security scanners comply with all the necessary requirements: human dignity, respect for privacy, non-discrimination and the guarantee of a high level of protection of human health in the definition and exercise of all European Union policies and actions, all of which are included in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. The systems in place are not usually those presented in the news or newspapers by critics of security scanners. The proposed systems do not show the human body, but rather a stick figure, a mannequin, a photograph of the fully-clothed passenger or simply an ‘OK’ in green when the passenger passes through without activating the alarm. In the area of data protection: data protection is an issue that is also under constant review, and is guaranteed by new scanner technology. This makes it possible for data to be automatically destroyed once the purpose for which it is collected has been achieved. With regard to body images, ladies and gentlemen: no body images will be produced. This is one of the basic points on which the vast majority agreed, without doubt because it affects privacy as a fundamental right that cannot be eroded. In the area of public health protection: the maximum guarantee has been given by Parliament. Ionising radiation, because of its harmful effects, whether through cumulative or long-term effects, has been made obsolete by another type of technology that does not affect passenger health. Therefore, Parliament is sending a clear message and saying ‘no’ to the use of X-rays. To summarise, ladies and gentlemen, security scanners are not perfect but they are, without doubt, more effective than simple metal detectors. They bring added value and can detect dangerous objects and items that conventional scanners cannot detect. They are a tool providing measures that are proportional to the risk they are trying to prevent. They will be optional and not compulsory for Member States, but those States that do introduce them should implement harmonised, minimum standards for everyone. They will not be compulsory for travellers, but those who refuse to use them will be obliged to submit to alternative procedures which are at least as effective as the security scanners. With regard to liquids: I am not going to refer to them as there will be a debate with the Commissioner, and two objectives have already been set: there is the unfulfilled objective of 29 April 2011, on which we are awaiting reports, and the guarantee that this will be met in 2013. The European Civil Aviation Conference guarantees that technology exists which is capable of detecting liquid explosives. Therefore, this report reaffirms that Parliament’s mandate must be implemented if everything is ready. It is clear that the first objective has not been met and, therefore, as I have already said and I repeat, we are awaiting the Commissioner’s comments. In the area of cargo and mail: the recent attacks carried out on passenger planes have led the European Union to develop a more ambitious plan and to act quickly to identify additional necessary measures. I support the idea that security and screening systems have to be proportional and equivalent. Goods transported on planes must be screened, particularly if 70% of cargo is transported on passenger planes. In this regard, I welcome the support of all the groups for raising the level of cargo security, as I proposed. To conclude, Mr President, all of the issues which are included in this report on aviation security are a response to previous terrorist acts, which is why, over the coming years, the European Union will endeavour to establish a security system that prevents and avoids future attacks. I particularly wish to thank all those who worked together to enable a very difficult and complex issue, which was initially rejected by Parliament, to reach this plenary session today – thanks to the Commission’s new attitude and the flexibility shown by the political groups – with widespread support and broad consensus. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his cooperation and dialogue. The Commission called on Parliament, and the Commission will take up the relay. The next steps are the Commission’s responsibility. We await the Commissioner’s comments. Luis de Grandes Pascual,

 Mr President, this time I will try to be brief and comply with your instructions. Commissioner, thank you very much for your attitude and for being receptive to Parliament’s report. We may presume from what you have said that you value and take on board many of our assessments. I say ‘our’ because this report is not only mine; rather it brings together a broad consensus, and that is positive. I would add that I am going to try to maintain that consensus up to the very last minute. Mrs Lichtenberger, we are going to accept your second amendment, because I believe it is beneficial to the area of training. With regard to your first amendment, I will try to ensure you do not have the same reservations over the issue of the name given to the scanners, because nobody gets them confused. I know that you mean well, but I would be grateful if you could withdraw the amendment. If not, then you are within your rights and I shall respect that, of course. With regard to the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I believe it will be necessary to look at them in greater detail; I very much regret that I do not agree with the principles of your amendments. These amendments are not fundamental, and I sincerely believe that there is an underlying intention to vote against them, which I regret. In any case, I would say earnestly to Mr Hénin, and I am sorry he is not here, that in a democratic society there are no grounds that legitimise any terrorist action. No political cause nor apolitical cause: terrorism must be flatly rejected in a democratic society. With regard to the amendments tabled by the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, and I am sorry that Mrs Foster is not here, for she is always very kind, I believe these are unnecessary because what they are seeking to achieve in the area of profiling could cause confusion. In paragraph 4, which we are also going to improve with an amendment put forward by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament so as to elaborate on the strengthening of data protection, it is not necessary to talk about profiling as that could cause confusion and give an impression of discrimination, and I am sure that no attempt will be made to do so. We are going to accept, not just accept for consideration, the S&amp;D Group’s oral amendment, because I believe it is good and, if Parliament accepts it, we will vote in favour of it. As far as the rest is concerned, I believe that we are going to truly fulfil the mandate given to us. Commissioner, I believe we have done well so far; we have passed the baton on to you and I hope you will rise to the occasion. I am sure you will, as you have shown talent and courage, and I am grateful that you are sorry about what happened on 29 April 2011. I know you are being sincere, and I hope that in 2013 we will fulfil all the objectives in the area of liquids, as we are all trying to do. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 Mr President, it is no coincidence that Spain, Italy, Greece, Ireland, Portugal and other countries are all reluctant to accept the so-called Eurovignette. This common critical stance stems from our position as peripheral countries since, at the end of the day, it will be us who will pay this quite singular levy and the Member States enjoying a geographical location in the centre of the European Union who will collect it. The reasoning that underlies the Eurovignette is beset by major contradictions and the discourse that supports it becomes weaker every day. Even accepting the rationality of internalising external costs as a valid starting point, it is ultimately untenable to penalise heavy goods vehicles only and not ordinary cars with the aim of mitigating traffic congestion, just as the old ‘polluter pays’ principle is applied in a clearly discriminatory way. In addition to this, ladies and gentlemen, only 15% of the funds collected through the Eurovignette – which was conceived as a funding source for infrastructures – will finally be used to fund trans-European networks, and not as a requirement but merely as a recommendation. Thus, finance ministries will allocate the funds as they see fit according to the interests of their countries, within the wide sphere of infrastructures. The ultimate result will be yet another setback for road freight transport, which, the way things stand today, is the only means enabling the operation of the Internal Market. This is reality, ladies and gentlemen, a reality that is a lot starker in the context of an economic crisis. If European products are to be competitive in global markets, we cannot afford experiments that may result in even further damage to an already weak European economy by imposing yet more additional costs. Lastly, the food crisis, which has recklessly been blamed on Spanish products, has led to unfair penalties and huge losses for those penalised by the Eurovignette: freight carriers and prime crop farmers. It is for all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, that the Spanish delegation of the European People’s Party shall vote against this draft directive. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Madam President, recently, the Church of Our Lady of Salvation in Baghdad was attacked and 58 people were killed, mainly women and children, purely because they were Christians. Al-Qaeda has proudly claimed responsibility for this deed. This is not an isolated incident, but rather the culmination of persecutions of and attacks on Christians in majority Muslim countries. There have been expulsions from Morocco, threats in Turkey and attacks in India and Nigeria. In January, six Christians were massacred at the door of a church in Cairo. For how long will Western democracies collude with this by remaining silent? Fortunately, President Buzek has made a statement on behalf of Parliament. The statement by the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, condemning the attack, limited itself to condemning a terrorist act. Why is the motive not mentioned, in other words, the fact that they were Christians, which was the unequivocal reason behind the attack? I have not heard anything from Mr Zapatero, nor have I heard anything from Prime Minister Erdogan. What is the point of the Alliance of Civilisations? I am ashamed of our simple-mindedness and cowardice. I cannot help recalling the late, misunderstood Oriana Fallaci, who announced the arrival of Eurabia
 and was practically stoned for having the courage to condemn what was happening in this neurotic Europe. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, must be congratulated. We have had dissimilar, even conflictive positions, but she has found compromise solutions that allow us to stand together today on this important issue. Ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided that all the seas should be protected in a similar way, arguing that any other solution would bring about a situation of unfair competition. We accept the position of the majority in favour of a legal situation with uniform rules for the entire Union, although I will not spare Members the fact that such a solution also clearly implies a certain degree of unfairness. It is obvious that the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel are more polluted and, in my view, sulphur monitoring will have to be stricter. The measures to reduce transport time and handling costs in ports are certainly positive initiatives. Nonetheless, I will repeat this again and again: we still have work to do on this matter. Unless we liberalise our ports resolutely, they will not be able to expand the key role they will be required to play in the context of co-modality. The promotion of a CO2
 reduction strategy aimed at altering the specific consequences of climate change is also to be welcomed. I think this is a good report that must be adopted. But we must not forget that this report is in the context of a serious disaster, namely that affecting the Gulf of Mexico. In this respect, the Commission is urged to judge whether it is necessary, within the framework of revision of the Regulation of the European Maritime Safety Agency, to strengthen the role of the Agency in carrying out preventive inspections and post-hydrocarbon-spill clean-up tasks. Commissioner, this, I believe, is a necessary reform and the necessary mandate must be used to support these tasks. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mrs De Veyrac on her report, which has enabled an agreement to be reached at first reading. I must, however, make three critical observations that imply the need to make concessions whenever there are negotiations of this type. Firstly, the individual identification of victims has been dropped: when DNA allows such identification to take place, it is natural for families to demand that they be given not just any bodies but the bodies of the victims to whom they are related. Secondly, the term ‘causes’ has not been replaced by ‘concurrent factors’. This is going to be a source of litigation, and I believe it is a serious error – and if not, time will tell – as the technical investigation needs to be separated from the legal investigation. Finally, we find it deeply regrettable that the Spanish delegation may ultimately have to abstain, regardless of its favourable opinion on the subject. This is, quite simply, because the relationship with Gibraltar Airport, which is now governed by the Ministerial Statement agreed in Cordoba in 2006, has been mentioned since 1987. Previously, the legislation was suspended and reference was made to the differences between the United Kingdom and Spain, and now three references are made to those legal differences, and nothing more. This, of course, means that we will have to abstain, regardless– I repeat – of our favourable opinion of the report and of the work done by Mrs De Veyrac. Once again, I would like to praise her for a good report that will be fundamentally positive. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, I would have liked to have made a different speech today, believe me. You set out six months full of ambition, and set the bar so high with your claims that, when these are compared with what was actually achieved, disappointment was inevitable. What is certain is that you have not been able to overcome a complex situation for which you lacked leadership and credibility. You yourself pointed out once that the European Union is a club with rules and I agree. However, it was up to you to demand obedience to these rules. The reality is that it was the government of Spain that urgently needed to fulfil its obligations. Within this context, positive achievements, whilst not lacking, have been undistinguished. Unlike me, you have had time to talk about them. Democracy is a public opinion-based system. This is how it seems: President Obama’s disdain, as well as the cancellation of the Mediterranean Summit and the one announced between the European Union and the United States, constitute very significant failures. The rush to reach improvised agreements at any cost has not helped the image of Spanish management: as a way of achieving a respectable objective, it could be described as amateurish. Spain is a great nation, and will continue to be one, despite the poor management of this period. Our diplomats and officials have kept a stiff upper lip and, thanks to this, Spain’s prestige will survive. The truth is that the situation in Spain will count for more within the value judgment that will be made of this Presidency than what was done or not done here. Someone who has taken his country into a phase of uncertainty and unrest would have difficulty in providing leadership for an enterprise this difficult. At best, this Presidency has been sadly irrelevant. Luis de Grandes Pascual,

Mr President, Mr Kallas, this is a directive that affects all customs formalities that apply to ships arriving in or departing from ports. Thus, it will favour short-distance maritime transport and will contribute to modal balance. The aim, ladies and gentlemen, is to reduce and simplify the amount of information and number of documentation and physical controls carried out by ships with respect to goods. At present, this information must be provided and these controls carried out repeatedly. The attitude of the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, who I would like to congratulate for his work, has been intelligent and open to dialogue. Particularly, as a shadow rapporteur, I feel represented in the final document and satisfied that my contributions have been taken on board. This is a process that has grown with time, during the course of which agreements were gradually reached, ranging from its adoption by the Committee on Transport and Tourism to the trialogue held on 7 June. The end result has been the consensus reached between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The agreements have covered some very important issues, to which the rapporteur and Commissioner Kallas have already referred. In my opinion, the compromise solutions reached with respect to the issue of the languages used, the time limit for its entry into force, and the one-stop shop, are balanced and worthy of support. I think a good job has been done. I would like to congratulate Mr Sterckx and believe the goals set for us by the Commission have been fully met. Moreover, I feel that we should be pleased about having reached this agreement between the three parties, the three institutions. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

 Mr President, in my opinion, this excellent report sets out the guidelines that must inspire the new White Paper on Transport that will shape European transport policy for the next 10 years. This report includes several issues that are worth outlining: the need for a financial fund as an essential instrument; the challenge of the growing demands of freight transport; the search for comodal solutions that make users and freight safe; the vital need for sufficient and secure rest areas for road transport; the – in my opinion, correct – diagnosis that the various modes of transport must complement each other, with efficiency criteria being sought rather than merely being in competition with each other; and the rapporteur’s – brave, in my opinion, and fair – assertion that transport by rail or sea is not always more environmentally friendly than road transport. In short, the concept of ‘efficient comodality’ is a concept for the future and it must certainly, in my opinion, be given full support. Luis de Grandes Pascual  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Kallas for being here and for the work that he has done during this difficult time. This is a debate that had to take place, ladies and gentlemen, and unfortunately, I think it will not be the last of its kind. I will spare you any repeats of the statistics of this serious event and the negative impact that it has had on the economy. I simply wish to remember those who were affected. Firstly, there were the passengers. Ten million people were left without flights and with no guidance as to what to do. The impact on passengers was so great that the provisions of directives and regulations could not protect them. The exclusion of liability in contracts due to catastrophe or force majeure
 brings to mind the need for a joint fund to tackle the consequences of a global disaster such as that caused by the volcano. I now come to the airlines. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that they lost EUR 1 700 million worldwide. The Association of European Airlines (AEA) assesses the loss at EUR 850 million at European level. This blow was all that they needed to accentuate a spiralling crisis that is threatening many airlines with closure. The other victim has been tourism. The consequences for tourism have been devastating. Firstly, due to the cancellation of contracts that had been made in advance, as is usual in this sector, and secondly, due to insecurity, which has caused a change in normal booking trends. This is my diagnosis, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. There can only be one conclusion: the European institutions do not have the tools to effectively tackle a crisis of this magnitude. Now I come to the criticism, because criticism is necessary and inevitable; self-criticism, if necessary. No one can be exonerated, because everyone involved acted badly, late and inefficiently, sometimes through no fault of their own. The Member States cannot be exonerated because, although the decisions were within their competence, they were still unable to act. The European institutions cannot be exonerated because they took four long days to react, and because their reaction, which invoked safety as their priority, did not unfortunately produce calm, but paralysis. I will now discuss the Commission’s response. Today, the Commission is reiterating the measures that it had announced to us. In my view, they are reasonable measures, but there is a lack of clarity about the timescale for implementing them. We are not talking about something in the past. Even today, there is a latent threat of flights being grounded, and it is concerning that we are dependent on air currents. I know that we cannot fight the elements. This was said by a famous Spanish sailor regarding a big naval battle that we lost. The crisis will not help us to take measures. The Member States will be reluctant to provide resources. If we are mean, however, this volcano could do more damage to the European economy than is being forecast. I ask the Commission to be determined, and I ask the Council to urgently tackle the need to take decisions. I ask everyone to be generous in implementing alternatives to make up for the incapacities of the institutions. I do not hold the Commission or the Council responsible, but we need to acknowledge the diagnosis that the institutions have not been capable, as they currently stand, of solving a crisis of this magnitude and proportions.

 Mr Zapatero, for a Spaniard, such as I am, it is an honour to greet you here, as you take your turn as the President of the European Union. This is a period of many expectations and challenges and, of course, we must not fail to live up to those expectations. It is important that our citizens see that our updated institutions are capable of providing solutions to real problems. You know that we agree with the programme you have put forward. You know that, for the Spanish Partido Popular
, this is a question of state and that we will be behind you in everything that we regard as being in the common interests of Europe and that is important to Spain. It is an ambitious programme and, hopefully, a programme full of content. I hope that in this album of the Spanish Presidency – since it will surely be colourful and varied – people can see every event as a milestone in the very real problems that affect them. The crisis is hitting economies and unemployment seems like the fifth horse of the Apocalypse. You have had the honesty to recognise that there is 20% unemployment in Spain, but that does not curtail you. I believe that it obliges us all to come up with a solution to a problem that we must solve together. It is a real problem. The time available does not allow me to say too much, Prime Minister. However, I do want to tell you that Spain faces many challenges ahead, that I am certain of Spain’s capability as a nation and that I want to believe and am sure that you will rise to the challenge. At this time in Europe, we must not fail to live up to these expectations On the other hand, the globalised world – and you have referred to it with intelligence – means that new centres of power are emerging and it is necessary for the European Union to take a more active and coherent role in defence of its values and interests. Otherwise, we run the risk of becoming irrelevant. Finally, Prime Minister, we Spanish will not accept being denied the ability to make proposals. We have that right. We must also have the humility to accept the advice that Don Quixote gave to Sancho Panza when he recommended humility in his fantasy about governing the Isle of Barataria.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain has just endured a painful situation in which a vessel, the Alakrana,
 and all its crew were subjected to blackmail, humiliation and countless risks. The Spanish Government is being called to account in Spain, as is appropriate in the case. In this House, we are going to talk of Europe and more Europe. Accordingly, it has to be stated that after a year in which we have demanded diplomacy and determination, the outcome has been positive. Operation Atalanta is inadequate, however. It needs to be broadened and made more flexible. It has to become possible to protect not only the routes along which humanitarian aid moves, but also Community fishing and merchant vessels. The latter must be protected, and that is why, in the resolution to be adopted tomorrow, we shall call on the European Parliament and on its institutions to make certain commitments. What we are seeking to do is to say ‘yes’ to the strong stance taken by states that protect their vessels with their armed forces to deter and, if necessary, legally repel pirate action. We must say ‘no’ to recourse to private security contractors, a move which, according to the IMO, carries with it the risk of unnecessary violence. We must say ‘no’ to the passive and dilettante attitude of governments that are making life easy for the pirates. We must say ‘yes’, however, to diplomacy, ‘yes’ to aid to Somalia, and ‘no’ to unsubstantiated charges of alleged illegal fishing. Community vessels are fishing in compliance with our international agreements. They are doing so legally and must be protected. The Community's institutions are duty bound to do so.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank you for being here this morning and also congratulate you on the good job you have done with the publication of the Single Market Act II. I would also like to applaud the work of Ms Bastos, which is correct and certainly necessary. I believe that the 12 proposals included in the act will surely constitute a major boost to the single market, and I especially welcome the inclusion of the creation of a genuine digital single market among those priorities. This year we are celebrating 20 years of the single market: 20 years of prosperity during which as Europeans we have expanded the opportunities available to our businesses and to the public. However, if we want to continue making progress and to be able to meet the forthcoming challenges of technological changes and developments, and ensure that our economy continues to be competitive in the global market, I firmly believe that, just as in the 1980s and 1990s we developed and established the four fundamental freedoms, now the main goal we must achieve is to create a true, genuine digital single market. I know, Commissioner, due to our close cooperation over the last two years, that the digital market is a priority for you. I would like to take this opportunity to once again offer my support so that we may continue the same cooperation between the Commission and Parliament that we have had so far in order to make the digital single market a reality. Exactly two weeks ago the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted the report on completing the Digital Single Market by a very large majority. I believe it is vital that both Parliament and the Commission convey to the Council the need to move forward with the recommendations in both documents and that we continue to work very closely in order to put them into effect. Pablo Arias Echeverría  (PPE

Madam President, I would like to thank the three Commissioners for being here today. We are experiencing a crisis that can only be overcome by reviving trade. There is no doubt that SMEs are the pillar underpinning the European economy and there is no doubt that we need more Europe and less market fragmentation. The digital revolution offers us many possibilities, and one of these is, without any doubt, electronic commerce. An increasing number of consumers buy online, but they only do so at a national level – things are more complicated at a European level. Market barriers do not help, and electronic commerce is almost non-existent at this pan-European level. In my opinion, and I have said this several times, the way out of the crisis is digital, and the time has come to go from poetry to prose. It is time for action. Our SMEs need concrete measures to increase their pan-European options and to develop their full potential in a market of more than 500 million consumers. Consumers, meanwhile, need a pan-European market that offers sufficient guarantees to allow them to trust in a true digital single market, in which they can buy products in the knowledge that their rights are assured, with freedom of choice and at a good price. The Consumer Rights Directive is a good first step. I would like to know what next steps the Commission has in mind with regard to copyright, data protection, VAT, accounting rules, a single domain for online transactions, conflict resolution, product shipping, etc. Pablo Arias Echeverría  (PPE

 Madam President, I would just like to say a word about the Working Group on e-Commerce. Thank you very much for your answer, Commissioner. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) has a Working Group on e-Commerce, and we would like you to take part in this so that we can discuss these proposals in greater depth and find out about the specific measures, enabling the IMCO Committee to gain a proper understanding of them.

Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the communication that you have presented to us. I think it is a good initiative in order to continue working to improve the single European market. I consider it vital that the 50 proposals that you referred to in your speech be debated. I hope that in Parliament, I will be able to play an active role in helping to overcome barriers to e-commerce in Europe. Many of the current barriers to e-commerce have already been detected, and there are even specific proposals for overcoming them. We could say that we are reliant on political will to resolve those barriers. I think that this communication is a good start, and I therefore think we should support it by playing an active role. Pablo Arias Echeverría,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES) 
Mr President, as you all know, the Internet and new technologies represent an unprecedented revolution that means that we need to modernise the mechanisms that regulate e-commerce in our economy in order to be able to tackle the challenges that we are facing. Just a few years ago, the new systems for trade over the Internet, and the new technologies and opportunities we have available to us now, did not exist. They are now a fact, however, and soon they will be an essential tool. As legislators, we need to be broad-minded enough to create tools for the public that solve the problems of today, but which foresee and can be adapted to the problems of tomorrow. This is a commitment that we must make and a responsibility that we are obliged to take on. We must prepare the way for what is to come and for those who are to come, and this means we need to overcome the obstacles to achieving that goal. E-commerce is a tool available to us with enormous potential for relaunching and improving the competitiveness of our economy and also for strengthening the internal market. It is a tool that can create a great deal of added value and offer great opportunities to the European people and businesses in this time of crisis. It is vital that the leaders of the European Union implement the necessary measures to overcome the existing barriers to cross-border e-commerce in Europe and that we generate confidence in this medium, simplify it and make the rules governing it transparent. That is the only way to ensure that the public and businesses will be able to reap the rewards of its enormous potential. That is the only way that we can be competitive in a global market that waits for no one. Either we take the necessary measures energetically, decisively and with leadership, or our competitors will leave us behind. The report that I am presenting today proposes measures for overcoming the barriers to cross-border trade. We have the opportunity not only to prepare the internal market for e-commerce, but also to help to complement the internal market through e-commerce. The measures that I propose in the report are aimed at improving the quality of access to the Internet in Europe, improving consumer confidence by creating a European quality mark, increasing monitoring and supervision of the network and conducting information campaigns so that users are aware of their rights and know how and where to complain if they have problems. They are also aimed at protecting the private property and personal data of users, promoting the development of initiatives that incentivise businesses to sell their products online, improving payment systems and simplifying the rules regarding the payment of taxes, among other measures. Finally, in this plan, I felt I needed to highlight the need to improve protection for minors using the Internet. I believe that all these measures are essential for promoting e-commerce and for adapting the rules that currently govern it to a future in which we are already living. We have an obligation to offer mechanisms to the market that make our businesses more competitive and strengthen our economies. This plan is undoubtedly a platform on which we can continue to build without any obstacles or hindrances. For these reasons, I would like to ask this House for its support to move forward with this initiative. Pablo Arias Echeverría  (PPE

Mr President, we all recognise the importance of this report and the efforts made by the rapporteur to achieve a consensus, and I would therefore firstly like to congratulate Ms Thyssen. This House has called on previous occasions for the establishment of an integrated financial framework, budgetary framework and economic policy framework. At the Council in June the guidelines and roadmap were agreed, which we must now begin to follow. It is now the time to do what was agreed. The first step is banking union based on three pillars. Firstly, a single supervisor, which is the key to breaking the circle between banking debt and sovereign debt; a second pillar based on the common deposit guarantee mechanism; and a third pillar based on a common bank crisis resolution system. These are three basic pillars in order finally to begin to generate stability and confidence. In this sense, I support the European Central Bank taking on as soon as possible the powers to act as single independent supervisor over all banks, obviously with the cooperation of the national authorities. With regard to direct recapitalisation of banks, I support what was adopted at the Council in June, in which the possibility was confirmed of a direct injection of cash into the banks once the single supervisor begins operation. In addition, fiscal union is the other goal that must be achieved in the medium term, in order to achieve an authentic and genuine economic and monetary union. In the same way, as a culmination of this whole process, we should move towards some sort of mutualisation of debt, in order to put an end once and for all to the differences in interest rates due to the doubts generated regarding the euro area. What is most important in all of this is what I said at the start: to do what we have agreed, therefore I reiterate my full support for the rapporteur. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am addressing the House with the simple aim of highlighting the importance of the European Semester as a tool for detecting the weaknesses in our system and for exercising the democratic legitimacy that Parliament represents. Following the beginning of the crisis, and thanks to the implementation of these mechanisms, we are succeeding in analysing its causes in order to lay the foundations for greater EU integration, which is the only response and the only option for bringing an end to the crisis and ensuring that this type of crisis cannot happen again. The semester represents the desire for coordination that we have been so much lacking so far in order to jointly manage our needs as Europeans. The tools related to the European Semester, the Annual Growth Survey and the Country-Specific Recommendations create greater stability for all Member States and deepen their knowledge. The report, presented by Mr Gauzès, which is the result of very hard work, reflects their value. Nevertheless, we must continue to promote greater coordination between our policies until we create not only true economic union, but true political union. This does not mean that agreements do not have to be fulfilled, but must be a further incentive for the EU to speak with once voice. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by underlining my support for free trade agreements as a fundamental means of stimulating the much-longed-for and much-needed economic growth and the creation of jobs. These agreements also boost relations with our allies, in this instance Japan.  The former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama recently stated in an article in the Wall Street Journal
 that both Brussels and Tokyo had strong ties with Washington, but that the ties between Brussels and Tokyo were not so strong. I agree with him that this agreement could be an opportunity to redress this imbalance.  Nevertheless, at a time when we are considering launching negotiations to conclude a free trade agreement with Japan, I believe that the European Union’s trade strategy should be in keeping with its industrial strategy and I would like to know the Commissioner’s opinion on this point.  In addition, if we want industry’s share of GDP to rise from the current 16 % to 20 %, as proposed in the Europe 2020 agenda, it would make sense, in my opinion, to listen to the concerns of industry itself when it comes to trade policy. The automotive industry is undoubtedly of key importance in this respect. We should therefore listen to its concerns and work with it to ensure that this agreement becomes a reality as soon as possible. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, firstly, I believe it is appropriate to congratulate Commissioner Barnier on his hard work and the great passion he is putting into this project. We are again faced with a decisive moment for the euro. There can be no more delays. We have to progress towards true economic and monetary union, and ultimately, true political union. There is no going back. We will all agree that banking union is the first basic and essential step towards political union. There are three main pillars of this banking union. The first is a single supervisory authority, which supervises all banks in the euro area, and it is even more important that it comes into force as soon as possible. The second is a common deposit guarantee fund. The third is a banking crisis management mechanism. We also need the option to be able to directly recapitalise banks when required, to break, as mentioned by Commissioner Barnier, the vicious circle between banking debt and sovereign debt, and to finally overcome the debt crisis. This is the real deal. There is no going back on the euro. The Spanish Government has made a proposal, an ambitious proposal, in this respect. This was born out of the Spanish Government’s commitment to Europe and the euro. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the expected adoption of the amendments to the safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas is a key step towards Parliament adopting the two agreements with Central America, Colombia and Peru. Those agreements are essential for the future of the European Union. These clauses, along with the progress made by Colombia, acknowledged by the political resolution adopted by this House on 13 June, as well as the support of the Central American countries and Peru for this regulation, should provide the final approval for the ratification of those agreements. These clauses will allow our producers to progressively adapt to a free-trade framework that will benefit us all. At a time when the United States and Asian countries are signing free-trade agreements with American countries, such as the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) or the agreements between the United States and Colombia and Peru, respectively, we cannot allow the leading trading power in the world, the European Union, to continue to miss opportunities. In this sense, I share the concern of the European business sector at the delay in these agreements coming into force. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, almost all of us agree that the way to exit the crisis is through austerity and reforms to instigate growth. We should not fall into the false debate of austerity versus growth: austerity is a key tool and required in order to achieve the goal of economic growth. In this respect, Spain is an example, an example of a country committed to fiscal consolidation and reforms. To achieve this, Europe must focus on the formation of fiscal policy measures that will ensure austerity as well as growth and job creation, but the European Central Bank needs, more than ever, to instigate a monetary policy that allows for the acceleration of the effects of the implemented structural reforms. The ‘policy mix’ is of key importance, today more than ever. There is a need to underpin the adopted fiscal measures with a more relaxed monetary policy that means that the aforementioned measures and reforms have the quickest possible effect: over 20 million unemployed people in Europe are waiting.

 Mr Romeva, the Spanish Government has not rejected any investment in the manner you mentioned, neither is the Spanish Government against the eurobonds. The Spanish Government has said that a step has to be taken prior to the implementation of the eurobonds, that of fiscal consolidation, but please be assured that the Spanish Government is in favour of the eurobonds.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank both the European Commission and the governments of Colombia and Peru for the great efforts made to successfully reach this agreement. I give my full support to an agreement that will undoubtedly benefit both regions, both Colombia and Peru, and will help to improve human rights conditions in Colombia. This agreement is an example for a key region for the European Union, as is South America. I am concerned about another agreement, however, one that the Commission is about to start negotiating. The Commission should show that it roundly defends the legal security of the investments that are made, which are so important in improving trade flow between both parties. I would like to take this opportunity, therefore, to ask Commissioner De Gucht about the measures being considered when it comes to the Repsol YPF issue. As has been the case with the agreement with Colombia and Peru which we are debating here, the best guarantee to reach a possible successful agreement with Mercosur would be a strong and decisive response from the European Union when it comes to the Repsol case. We should not allow our allies on the other side of the Atlantic to be more robust than we are when it comes to an issue that affects Europe. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,

 Mr President, Mr Šemeta, the last European Council meeting focused on the need to improve the taxation system in order to improve tax collection efficiency and put a stop to tax evasion and tax fraud. Spain will introduce a law on this matter. The ideas that have been put forward by the Council and given expression in this resolution are priorities of Spain’s economic policy and, I am certain, that of the rest of Europe as well. They will enable us to bring about legal certainty, reduce the informal economy and lower the number of people who are not fulfilling their tax obligations; this will be sure to create a fairer Europe. Furthermore, we should bear in mind the recommendations made by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the principle of trying to eliminate or reduce to a minimum the comparative disadvantage between those who have fulfilled their taxation obligations and those who do not fulfil them. The resolution we shall vote on in plenary and the Spanish plan to prevent and combat tax fraud therefore seek to fight against the informal economy, promote transparency and European coordination, boost tax collection – enabling the deficit to be reduced, which is so badly needed at the moment – and not damage opportunities for growth but, on the contrary, create a fairer and more efficient system that reflects those opportunities. Those decisions will have a very positive impact on the public accounts and, I insist, will make a significant contribution to reducing the deficit and, therefore, to restoring growth. Finally, while we are talking about growth, I want to take this opportunity to stress that, in order to achieve the growth we so badly want, we should continue to pledge our commitment to internationalising our economy and our businesses, as the Council has stated many times. To achieve that, however, we need to guarantee the legal certainty of our investments, but I do not want to speak ahead of the debate we shall have later.

 Mr President, firstly, Ms Muñiz, the Spanish Government has not passed any tax amnesty laws because, as you are aware, that concept is not included in the Spanish constitution. It is true that the Spanish Government has proposed regularisation, as other countries such as Belgium and Germany have done, as well as other Spanish governments of your own political affiliation – that is, the Socialist Party, a few years ago.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my third speech in the House so far this year on this issue and I am sorry to stick to the same refrain but, as my fellow countryman, Miguel de Unamuno, used to say: ‘to strike the nail once, you must strike the horseshoe a hundred times’. Furthermore, I want to repeat the call to actively implement the measures that have been agreed in the last few Councils. As the President of the Commission has said, we need to finish the job. We need growth, ladies and gentlemen. With austerity, we will manage to create stability and confidence, but we also have to emerge from the crisis and create work and well-being once more. We need to commit to urgent implementation of the measures that were agreed upon in the last few Councils to incentivise growth. These measures must be accompanied by reforms. Spain is clearly committed to this spirit of reform. In less than 100 days, we have passed three key reforms: budgetary stability, financial reform and labour reform and this spirit of reform does not end here. As Mariano Rajoy says, the Spanish Government not only announces reforms, it carries them out, which is a different thing altogether. Let us follow its example. Let us not announce plans for growth, let us implement them. Furthermore, we need a degree of adaptability to circumstances given that we live in a world of constant change and evolution. As the President of the government of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, said recently before the House and as the Economy Minister, Luis de Guindos confirmed today, Spain is fulfilling its duties and will continue to do so. Spain is more committed than ever to Europe. It has demonstrated this right from the start, putting its cards on the table and standing by its desire to comply with what has been agreed.

 Mr President, Commissioner, after the Council meetings held recently, Adenauer’s statement that ‘we all live under the same sky, but we do not all have the same horizon’, appears to be losing clout in favour of the construction of this common area, the European Union. The most important issue remains, however, in that we should actively implement all the measures agreed during recent Council meetings. Up to now, the austerity measures appear to have been applied most speedily. I will insist as many times as is necessary in this plenary, however, that we are not getting anywhere by only applying austerity; we need growth. These tough but essential adjustment programmes have to go hand in hand with the necessary reforms to generate growth and employment. Up to now, Spain has been at the forefront of this comprehensive austerity and reform plan. The three major reforms that were approved – ‘budgetary stability’, ‘reform of the financial system’ and ‘labour reform’ – testify to that. These reforms have merited the acknowledgement of different governments and media, despite the obstacles being placed in their way by launching unfounded rumours. The latter began with sport and yesterday threatened to spread into our economy and our politics. Let us continue to work for the same horizon. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, congratulations on your appointment. Prime Minister, we are celebrating the decisions adopted during the last Council, but it is my hope and wish that they do not remain mere words, but that they also become actions and come to fruition as soon as possible. We must send a solid message to the markets. Up to now, they have been very welcoming of the measures. Furthermore, there is a sense of eagerness for cooperation and a spirit of willingness, both of which we will continue to have great need of over the coming months. We must maintain and continue to consolidate our efforts in favour of stability and continue to put our trust in austerity measures, but these must be accompanied by other measures to generate growth and, therefore, employment. We cannot recover from this crisis through austerity measures alone. We need to bring reforms to fruition, not just debate them. Spain is showing that it is fully committed to this idea. That is why we are supporting the structural reforms that must be implemented by the Member States. The European Central Bank, for its part, has demonstrated courage when taking decisions, but it must show greater commitment through more active participation in the secondary debt markets. Furthermore, the common financial mechanisms that have been debated at such length in this House must be implemented. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Madam President, this question is for Vice-President Tajani. We all realise how important professional mobility is in building a versatile, competitive workforce. In fact, two of the pillars of the Europe 2020 strategy are innovation and entrepreneurship. Mr Vice-President, as you know, we currently have Erasmus for undergraduates, the Marie Curie programme for researchers and Erasmus for entrepreneurs. I think it would also be necessary to design a programme to provide cross-cutting opportunities to young innovators so that they can carry out their projects not only in universities but also in companies, start-ups, laboratories or government agencies. The members of the European Parliament Youth Intergroup have put forward a proposal to undertake a project entitled ‘Young Innovators Mobility’, which sets out to achieve just that. Mr Vice-President, I would like to know whether this initiative has the Commission’s support. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Madam President, in paragraph 2 of Article 9a, after the words ‘at the request of a Member State’, we would like to add the phrase ‘any legal person or any association not having legal personality acting on behalf of the Union industry’.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner De Gucht, early in this parliamentary term, which is my first, one of the matters I first heard discussed was precisely the Free Trade Agreement with Korea. Certain sectors of European industry, especially the automotive industry, were unanimous in opposing this agreement. As a citizen of Navarre and Spain, where the automotive industry represents a substantial part of our economy, I felt the duty to become involved in order to improve, if not the agreement as this was no longer possible, the safeguard clause, which was where Parliament could introduce improvements. Thus, we set out to achieve two objectives. Firstly, to protect the industry and its jobs, and secondly, to make the agreement more attractive for the industries concerned, particularly the automotive industry. Our aim was not just to avoid outright rejection, but to gain their support for the agreement. I believe that here today, we can say ‘mission accomplished’. This is all thanks to Parliament’s hard work and expertise. I should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteurs of both reports for their outstanding work. Thank you Robert. And thank you also for your words. Recognition is also due to the members of the Committee on International Trade, led by its Chair, Mr Moreira. ¡Muito obrigado!
, Vital. I would also like to thank the Belgian Presidency of the European Union for their excellent work. Their effort has had its reward in the form of the agreement we finally reached in December. Lastly, I would like to highlight the work of the European Commission, and particularly Ignacio Bercero’s contribution, for which I am most grateful. Tomorrow we will vote in favour of a clause which will be more effective, easier to apply and will genuinely protect European industry. Today, concerns on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea have hugely diminished. Indeed, we might say that they have all but vanished. Today, the opportunities this agreement brings clearly outweigh the uncertainties. The European Parliament should be proud of a job well done. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

Mr President, I would first like to clarify that I am in favour of strengthening trade links between the European Union and Papua New Guinea that promote the development of the region, but it must be sustainable development. I sincerely believe that this agreement, as it currently stands, is not a good one. I am entirely against one clause of the agreement, which I consider to be unfair: the exemption from the rules of origin, because not only does it endanger the sustainable development of Papua New Guinea, but, as we have heard here today, it endangers a whole European industry: the canning industry. This concession should have been absolutely exceptional, and it should not have been applied in the case of Papua New Guinea. Moreover, let us not forget the serious precedent that this measure is setting, and will set, for future European Union negotiations. In my opinion, there needed to be a much clearer and firmer resolution in this respect, stating categorically that, at the next review of the Interim Partnership Agreement, the exemption from the rules of origin will be permanently suspended. I therefore want to ask the Commission to take into account the dramatic consequences that this concession is going to have, firstly, for the European canning industry, and secondly, for the sustainability of the environment and natural resources of Papua New Guinea, and the very negative precedent being set for future negotiations. However much the Commission has said that it will not be a precedent, the pressure will be there. I therefore ask the Commission to decide to put an end to the exemption from the rules of origin as soon as possible. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,

Mr President, the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea will open up opportunities for both European and Korean industry, but in order to prevent any negative effects on European industry, it is essential to have an effective safeguard clause. All the political groups unanimously decided last week that the time had come for Parliament to take a position in plenary on the amendments adopted by 27 votes in favour and just one abstention in the Committee on International Trade in June, which are vital in order for the safeguard clause to be applicable and effective. As you are aware, we are going to vote solely on the amendments and, in accordance with Rule 57, we will defer the vote on the legislative report to the second part-session in October. At the same time, we unanimously decided not to close the door on a possible agreement at first reading, which we firmly believe will be possible. However, in order to do so, it is vitally important that we send a clear signal of unity and strength from all the political groups. That is why it is important for Parliament as a whole to strongly support the whole package of amendments. Pablo Zalba Bidegain,  
rapporteur. 
– (ES) 
Mr President, Commissioner, President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea will open up opportunities for both European and Korean industry. However, in order to prevent any negative effects on European industry, it is essential to have an effective safeguard clause. That is what my colleagues and I have been working on over the past few months in the Committee on International Trade, which is why it is important for Parliament as a whole to strongly support the whole package of amendments. The report was adopted by 27 votes in favour and one abstention in June. Under this clause, it will be possible to apply safeguard measures if the reductions to the customs duties on products imported from South Korea threaten to cause serious damage to European industry. As you know, under the new powers given to Parliament following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the adoption of this regulation is following the ordinary legislative procedure. Unfortunately, it was not possible to hold a trialogue with a mandate from the Council before the summer recess. The first official trialogue was held on 30 August, and both the shadow rapporteurs and I were able to hear the Council’s reaction to our amendments. That meeting enabled us to move forward on many points and define the final text of some paragraphs, and our feeling following the meeting is that we believe the Council genuinely wants to reach an agreement on the most controversial points and is working hard to do so. This is, of course, something that we view very positively. However, at the same time, we do not think there has been time to sufficiently clarify the Council’s position on the points on which it has a different view to that adopted in the Committee on International Trade. All the political groups therefore unanimously decided that the time had come for Parliament to take a position in plenary on the amendments adopted in the Committee on International Trade in July, which are vital in order for the safeguard clause to be applicable and effective. At the same time, a unanimous decision was taken not to close the door on a possible agreement at first reading, which we firmly believe will be possible when the Council clarifies its position. We will therefore vote tomorrow only on the amendments tabled by the Committee on International Trade and, in accordance with Rule 55, we will defer the vote on the legislative report to the second part-session in October, when we hope to reach a positive conclusion to the legislative procedure. We believe that the report incorporates a whole series of improvements such as creating an on-line platform to speed up the processes; the possibility of the industry being able to initiate an investigation process; the Commission being obliged to produce reports; and improvements in the monitoring and surveillance of Korean imports. These are points on which we have already reached an agreement in principle with the Council. I think this is a good result, but we still do not think it is enough. There are other, even more fundamental points that deserve the full attention of the negotiators and which all the political groups must defend here, as we did in the Committee on International Trade. I am essentially talking about four points. Firstly, we need to mitigate the possible risk to the more vulnerable Member States by establishing a regional clause, region by region, to prevent some sensitive industries from being affected. We should not forget that the safeguard clause is essentially temporary and its objective is precisely to safeguard the most sensitive sectors of the economy so that they have sufficient time to adapt to the new situation. Secondly, we need to clearly establish surveillance for the products affected by the duty drawback clause. Thirdly, we need to defend Parliament’s role in the process of initiating investigations, and the final point is the decision-making process or comitology. As well as mentioning the good will shown by the Belgian Presidency during the negotiations, finally, I want to mention the vital role that the Commission is playing and will continue to play in bringing the negotiations to a sound conclusion.

Madam President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their kind words. Commissioner De Gucht, as we have heard here today, the European Parliament is making its position very clear. As one fellow Member said, this is an historic moment that will set a precedent and this is an historic report that will set a precedent for future agreements. Parliament wants to reach an agreement at first reading and will do everything it can to achieve that. As one of my fellow Members said, this is a key moment for European industry, which needs the new incentives and new markets that this agreement is bound to bring. This is also, however, a delicate time for employment, and we need to guarantee employment in Europe. We also need to guarantee that this agreement does not damage European industry, and in order to do so, we need a strong safeguard clause such as the one adopted by the Committee on International Trade, which will probably be endorsed and strengthened by Parliament’s votes tomorrow. It is therefore now time for the Council and also the Commission to act. The Commission must continue to support us, and we appeal to both institutions to take responsibility. I want to stress that we will seek to reach an agreement at first reading, but we need to get moving. I believe that it is possible, and we await the proposals. Pable Zalba Bidegain,

Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that we must see Latin America as a hugely important trade partner. We believe that negotiations should be reopened for the agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which affects 700 million people and will be the most ambitious bi-regional agreement in the world. We also believe that negotiations concerning the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit, which is to be held in May. We also need to develop the association agreements with Mexico and Chile, which have been a real success. We must therefore express our satisfaction at the conclusion of the free trade agreement with Colombia, which is going to be very beneficial both to Europe and to the Latin American country. We believe that Parliament’s job now is to ratify these agreements in due time and to ensure that no country in the Andean Community that wishes to conclude an agreement is excluded. We, of course, also believe that free trade agreements can and should also be a useful tool for promoting the development of citizens’ rights and freedoms. Lastly, we believe that the path to follow in the future is, on the one hand, to develop the European Union’s agreements with the various countries and regional groups and, on the other, to promote inter-regional integration agreements within Latin America itself. Pablo Zalba Bidegain  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is very clear as far as the European Union’s trade policy is concerned. We are firm defenders of free trade and it is certainly vital that Europe continues negotiating trade agreements with other countries because they generate new opportunities for European companies, that is to say, new jobs, which are very much required in light of the serious current economic crisis. I did very much like your words Commissioner, because I also believe that it is very important that these agreements contain sufficient guarantees to avoid signing clauses which are unbalanced and unfair for European industry. The agreement with South Korea has been put forward by the Commission as the first in a new generation of more ambitious trade agreements for Europe, hence the importance of this agreement. It is not a question of whether it is a small country or not; it is a question of not weakening our capacity for negotiation in future agreements with much larger countries. Therefore, we are not against the South Korea free trade agreement; however, we do want certain paragraphs to be studied more rigorously, which we believe create unfair competitive disadvantages for certain European industrial sectors and give Korean producers an unfair advantage. Commissioner, I want you to clearly explain to me why the safeguard clause for the duty drawback enters into force in five years. On the last opportunity I had to speak to you, you stated that the reason was that tariffs on vehicles were also dismantled after five years. The agreement stipulates that they will dismantle the tariffs for vehicles which weigh more than five tonnes after five years. However, for vehicles which weigh less than five tonnes, which are all standard vehicles, the 10% tariff will be dismantled in three years. What is the reason for this two-year time lapse Commissioner? I would also like to receive more details regarding any updates on this aspect you mentioned. What is the point of correcting these problems ex post 
when the whole reason for having a safeguard clause is to anticipate possible negative consequences? Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

 – (ES) 
Mr President, the agreement reached by Parliament and the Council reflects what was unanimously approved by the Member States concerned in the International Maritime Organisation. These seas have disconcerting levels of acidification. Moreover, their capacity for regeneration is very limited. The fuels required are going to be more expensive, and therefore there are plans for financial aid for businesses, which is very reasonable. Some Members, however, have sought to have the requirements for new fuels applied to all the Union’s seas. We would find ourselves with a paradox in that we would be trying to solve an environmental problem of some Member States by creating a major economic problem in the Mediterranean, which does not have that environmental problem, but does have other environmental problems, the costs of which we are not seeking to impose on the other Member States. The Treaty is very clear. Sensitive areas must be protected. However, not all areas are equally sensitive. Pilar Ayuso,

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Ms Auconie for her hard work and efforts to reach a consensus. With regard to the two issues at hand, I must say that I entirely agree with the Commission’s proposal on the electronic identification of beef. However, I cannot say the same for the voluntary beef labelling system. The Commission’s proposal to delete this provision is neither appropriate nor correct. Specifically, this labelling system has played a very important role in restoring European consumers’ confidence in beef and products derived from beef. In my view, the argument being put forward by the Commission regarding a heavy administrative burden is not valid at present, as the operational mechanism is perfectly familiar to the authorities and the sector. Proof that the mechanism is working very well can be found in the fact that in my country, for example, 180 requests for beef labelling have been approved, as opposed to just 32 for goat meat and 55 for poultry and eggs. Voluntary labelling is a highly effective tool for making a distinction between varieties of a product, and consumers want to be informed about what they are buying and consuming. However, consumers do not distinguish between voluntary and mandatory labelling, and they often consider voluntary labelling to be more important and more relevant than mandatory labelling. All of this information combined is what enables them to make informed choices. Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 is by no means perfect, but it is nevertheless much better than the legal vacuum that could be created if Articles 16, 17 and 18 are deleted, because we would be faced with a new system with no prior warning and no mandatory external control. One possible solution to improve the system would be to establish specific sectoral standards for beef, as already exist for other products, such as those in the chicken and poultry sector. I believe the Commission is in the process of doing so. Lastly, I would like to point out that labelling plays a vital role in consumer decision making, and this is precisely what we have defended in Parliament. It is therefore very hard to understand why we should now want to abolish it. Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to draw attention to the excellent work done by Ms McAvan, the rapporteur, and also the other shadow rapporteurs, in order to reach this agreement at first reading. This was very important because the regulation we adopted in 2010 was coming into force and it needed to be amended. It was not amended because it was a flawed piece of legislation – quite the contrary. Rather, it was amended because, as has been said, recent events took place, of which we are all aware, showing that there was a loophole that needed to be closed in order for it not to occur again. It was also necessary to strengthen certain specific points concerning pharmacovigilance and the safety of medicines once placed on the market. As we have already heard, from now on, marketing authorisation holders who do not renew a marketing authorisation or who withdraw or request the withdrawal or suspension of an authorisation will be obliged to inform the competent authorities of the real reasons and motives for withdrawing or suspending it. This is a major success for transparency and it will prevent the market authorisation holder from trying to conceal the real reasons behind its decision. Moreover, in the event that any of these actions is carried out in a third country, all the Member States in which that medicine is marketed must be informed. All this will improve transparency and safety, without the European Medicines Agency and national agencies being overly burdened as a result. The second important amendment we have achieved is that all authorised products that are subject to some kind of post-authorisation safety study (PASS) will be systematically included on the list of products subject to such monitoring. Lastly, we cannot forget that pharmacovigilance plays a fundamental role, and Parliament should therefore adopt this proposal. Pilar Ayuso,

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Perello on the enormous amount of work he has done, on his readiness to collaborate with all the shadow rapporteurs, and also to congratulate the shadow rapporteurs on the way they have all worked with each other. I also praise the Polish Presidency and the Commission for their efforts to reach an agreement on first reading. Parliament, the Council and the Commission have had divergent positions, sometimes very different, on several issues, and this made the agreement far from easy and not fully satisfactory to everyone, but we can say that it is reasonably satisfactory. The point that must be highlighted in the amendment of this directive, as already stated, is that, from now on, sugar may not be added to either pressed or concentrated juices. However, fruit nectars will be products sweetened with sugar, honey or sweeteners. It is clear that the average consumer is unaware of this legislation and, therefore, of the difference between juices and nectars. For this reason, I feel that the agreement between the three institutions to put a statement on packaging for a limited period to say that fruit juices do not contain sugar will not only help consumers to tell the difference between two products, but also make them much better informed. The objective of this initiative was to amend Directive 2001/112/EC for the second time, bringing it into line with technical progress and the developments in international regulations relating to the Codex Alimentarius. However, despite the support of all the farming organisations in the Union, as already mentioned, the Council and the Commission, surprisingly, have rejected the possibility of mandarin juice being added to orange juice in amounts less than 10% and mandarin appearing on the list of ingredients, as permitted by the Codex Alimentarius (STAN 45-1981), given that this is common practice in Brazil and the United States, from which we import a large amount of concentrates. In this regard, another area of conflict during the negotiations was the restoration of flavour, pulp and cells lost during the juice and nectar extraction process. All sides agreed, during the negotiations, to maintain the Commission’s original proposal on restoring flavours, pulp and cells from the same fruit species. However, some members of my political group are going to vote against this report for precisely this reason. Lastly, I would like to mention two things that worry me. Firstly, imported products marketed within the European Union are not generally required to meet the same quality and food safety standards as our own products, and in a case such as this one, in which such standards are required by the legislation, they are not sufficiently controlled. The second thing, which also concerns me, is the way the Commission uses delegated acts to substantially amend legislation, as it has recently attempted to do with the regulation on nutrition and health claims with regard to the ‘no added sugar’ claim. This is similar to what it is trying to do at the moment, although it is not the same case, with the Timber Regulation. This is the reason for Parliament’s position on delegated acts. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner. Mrs Sommer, the shadow rapporteurs, the Hungarian Presidency and the Commission have come to a good agreement with regard to this Regulation which is so important for consumers and the food industry. Many congratulations to all of them. As consumers, of course, we want comprehensive information about everything we eat. However, to put this information on the packaging is no mean feat and we must find a balance in everything. We must also find a cost-benefit balance as we cannot overlook the fact that the information on the labelling, depending on the nature of that information, makes the product more expensive. Someone has to pay that cost. If the consumer does not pay it then many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will have to quit the market as they cannot compete with large companies that can pay this additional cost. I believe that this balance has been achieved and we have to be satisfied. We have to be satisfied with regard to country of origin labelling, for example. It was already foreseen that, where confusion may arise, the origin of products should be labelled. Furthermore, it is permitted that this labelling may be done voluntarily. With regard to processed products containing several ingredients, it is not easy to determine what the main ingredient is. Therefore, another solution other than that adopted would raise implementation problems because of the economic cost and administrative complexity for the companies, without bringing the consumer any clear additional benefit. Also in this context, I agree that this legislation should not be applied to alcohol products as all these products already have comprehensive legislation concerning labelling, and everyone knows that when you drink an alcohol product you are consuming alcohol and that it has calories. In short, all of this is important but, above all, it is very important to educate consumers so that they are able to absorb all this information. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

Mr President, first of all, I wish to express my condolences to the relatives of those who have died as the result of this crisis. Commissioner, informing the public of health risks is a difficult and delicate task and has to be perfectly documented and verified. It is not a question of finding who is to blame, but on this occasion, major errors have occurred, starting with the foolhardy and reckless assumptions of a regional policy manager, recently recruited to the job, who unleashed social alarm and a very serious, irreparable economic crisis. Nor would it appear that the Commission has coordinated this crisis very well. I wonder when the first case occurred, and whether Article 3 of the regulation relating to the rapid alert system – which requires Member States to notify the risk immediately and within 48 hours – was met, and also whether Article 8 of said regulation – which obliges the Commission to check whether the information is complete, true and legible and has sufficient legal basis – was met. What is certain is that the serious shortcomings of this regulation have been exposed and that it is necessary to review the current legal framework in order to define precisely, among other things, the crisis management procedures used by the competent authorities, to attribute errors or omissions to the perpetrator in the food chain (and traceability is used to this end), to prevent health protection from concealing commercial barriers and to arbitrate compensation procedures for damage to trade and loss of profit. Commissioner, neither cucumbers or soya are the cause. As Mr Liese has said, the cause is the pathogen. The cause is serotype O104:H4 of the bacterium Escherichia coli
, which is already described throughout scientific literature and is associated with meat products. However, in any case, Commissioner, we have to allow the scientists to do their work: they need to investigate the entire traceability system, throughout the food chain, including the handling and distribution of food.

Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Liotard, the Hungarian Presidency and Commissioner Dalli and his team for their efforts. Unfortunately, however, this regulation, which is so important and so necessary, has not reached a satisfactory conclusion because of a labelling requirement that went beyond what was possible in practice. This is a subject that inspires passion and attracts media attention, factors that run counter to logic and pragmatism. I have to say that we have missed the chance to take a step forward, have condemned the agri-food industry to living with obsolete legislation and have put the brakes on European technological advancement, of which we are so supportive in theory. We cannot demand something that involves a level of cost and bureaucracy that cannot be assumed by the food-producing sector, nor can we demand something that we are not capable of imposing upon third parties. We cannot legislate on something that later we will not be able to implement because we would be deceiving consumers. I repeat, it is a pity that we have not reached agreement because this regulation dealt not only with cloning and with how many generations and which products must be labelled, but also with many other points on which agreement has
 been reached, such as nanotechnology and foodstuffs coming from third countries, which were very important for consumers and for the agri-food industry, not only from the point of view of the internal market, but also from a health perspective and in terms of innovation. Since cloning is too complex a matter to relegate to a few paragraphs in another proposal, I urge the Commission once again to prepare a report and present a separate legislative proposal that regulates every aspect of cloning, based on food security and all scientific data. Given that Commissioner Dalli has committed himself on numerous occasions before this House to presenting this proposal, I trust that the Commission will send it to us as soon as possible.

Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, who has worked very hard and, most importantly, achieved an optimum result. It was not at all easy to reach an agreement at first reading on a regulation as complex as this one. The motor industry is of vital importance in the European Union. It is, moreover, an industry that is committed to the European Union’s objective of reducing emissions and to technological innovation. This agreement is a stable framework that gives legal certainty to our vehicle manufacturers. I believe that the targets for reducing emissions are both ambitious and realistic. Manufacturers will have to achieve 147 grams of CO2
 per kilometre by 2020. I am sure that they are going to succeed, and they will therefore have contributed to the European Union’s objective of reducing emissions by 20% by that year. However, there are also other elements of interest in this new regulation, such as super-credits and promoting alternative fuels. Biofuels are clearly promoted, in line with the EU’s objectives regarding renewable fuels for 2020. I am highlighting this obvious fact because if the Commission continues with its hesitant proposals on biofuels, we will not achieve our objective for 2020. Finally, I would like to end my speech by congratulating the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), who has just become a mother and has worked very hard and also helped to make this agreement a success. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE

 Madam President, our goals must be ambitious, but it must also be acknowledged that the rapporteur’s proposal is not easy to apply with the situation that exists in each Member State. However, we in the Spanish delegation will support his proposal at first reading. Nevertheless, we are in favour the cost of recycling and treatment being invoiced separately. We are going to vote against Amendment 52, which aims to delete Article 14(1), and in favour of Amendments 91 and 103. We believe that consumers have a right to know what this treatment costs and, moreover, that they should know: that motivates them to collaborate with the legislation itself and it is also positive in order for there to be a suitable amount of transparency in the commercial chain.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to highlight the work that has been done by the rapporteur, Mrs McAvan, not only on the content of the report, but also in terms of her methods, because she has worked alongside all the shadow rapporteurs. I would also like to thank the experts from the Spanish Government for their contribution to this agreement. The purpose of this system of pharmacovigilance in the European Union is to strengthen vigilance, transparency and communication in relation to the safety of drugs once they have been put on the market, especially with regard to their risk profiles and the adverse reactions that they can cause. It is important to highlight the creation of the European Pharmacovigilance Committee, which will evaluate and issue recommendations to the European Medicines Agency on the safety issues that can arise in connection with medicines sold in the European Union. The solution that has been reached for both Member States and those responsible for marketing medicines to notify the EudraVigilance database of suspected adverse reactions is very important. EudraVigilance will be the only source of information, but the competent authority in the Member State where it is suspected that an adverse reaction has occurred will be informed at the same time, which is very important. It is also important to highlight the possibility that is being opened up of consumers being able to communicate any adverse reactions, and in this respect, the creation and management by the agency of a European medicines safety web-portal which, in turn, is linked to the portals in each of the Member States, is going to help to improve the public’s knowledge regarding the safety of the medicines that they take. Finally, we cannot forget that given that pharmacovigilance plays a fundamental role in protecting public health, the adoption of this directive and this regulation is going to make a significant contribution to that protection by improving not only the current procedures but also the coordination of actions between the different Member States.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his explanation about the cloning of animals for use as food. Both Parliament and Commission agree that the Novel Food Regulation was indeed not the appropriate framework to deal with this issue. We agree on this, which explains why the issue has been withdrawn from the scope of application of the regulation. We are also all aware, at least according to all the scientific committees, that cloned animal meat, and that of its offspring, satisfy all food safety requirements. It is only here that I see a problem. Namely, that it is impossible to distinguish whether or not meat comes from a cloned animal, or the offspring of a cloned animal, or from an animal that has not been cloned. Therefore, there is a need – an essential need – to use labelling and traceability in order for the consumer to be informed. Consumers want, and have the right, to know if the meat they are eating comes from a cloned animal or not, regardless of knowing whether or not it is healthy, because they may refuse to eat it owing to the issues you have explained, such as animal welfare, or for ethical reasons. It seems, therefore, given this situation, that the production and consumption of cloned animals in Europe is probably going to be banned, particularly its production. Thus, we are going to ban our producers from using a new technique, one that is good for animal reproduction and which, moreover, can make a profit, because obviously, an animal is cloned as a result of having very special characteristics, something which has been done in Spain with fighting bulls, where, as you know, two fighting bulls have been cloned. And we are going to ban it! Are we going to deny them the possibility of using this technique? Because, if that is the case, then our farmers, our livestock breeders, are going to lose competitiveness. This would be fine if, in Europe, we could ban the entry of meat from cloned animals, and their offspring, from other countries. However, are we going ban it? We cannot do so. The World Trade Organisation is not going to accept our ban. Therefore, we are going to have an absurd situation whereby our livestock breeders are not going to be able to use a new technique that will enable them to become more competitive, yet, we are going to be eating such food in the European Union, with or without a label. This is what worries me, and I feel a solution needs to be found. Why are we going to ban it? Why are we going to prevent our livestock breeders from using this technique, only to later bring this food in from outside because we cannot ban its importation? Pilar Ayuso,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, as you have said, this regulation is very important, not only for consumers, but also for the food industry. It deals with novel foods and new processes for manufacturing foodstuffs. As has been said here, the most controversial issue has been that of meat originating from cloned animals and their offspring, as what generally enters the food chain is the offspring, not the cloned animal. I believe that it was a sensible move on the part of Parliament to remove the issue of meat from cloned animals from this proposal, as it is not really possible to dedicate just a few paragraphs to such a novel and new technique as the cloning of animals, even though it is normal in some countries. There is an amendment relating to this within which the Commission, as you have promised, is asked to present a report and a legislative proposal. We are having a bit of a debate here, including within my own group, as to whether we should ask the Commission to present a proposal banning meat from cloned animals, or simply ask the Commission to present a proposal. My opinion is that the Commission should present the proposal, and we should not tell it how to present it. The Commission should present the proposal, and then we will debate it in Parliament, say whether we like it or do not like it, and amend it. This is my position, although we are divided within my group, and tomorrow we will vote on a divided basis. There is another issue, which interests me a great deal, and which you have mentioned, which is the issue of nanomaterials. I agree that a new definition is needed, but we should not limit ourselves to definition and labelling. Any authorisation of nanomaterials must be preceded by exhaustive scientific tests, as these are new materials that are to be incorporated into food, and the question of food safety needs to be a priority. I hope and trust that this will be the case. Pilar Ayuso  (PPE
) 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this regulation is of crucial importance for consumers and the agri-food industry, because it is not at all easy to achieve balanced labelling that includes all the essential information but not so much as to complicate it. This is an excellent report and the rapporteur must be congratulated on it. I agree with her on the main subjects regarding nutritional information and the controversial issue of profiles, especially if we bear in mind that the Commission failed to meet its commitment to establish these profiles – as well as the conditions for their use – before 19 January, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. An issue that concerns me is the possibility that national labelling standards will be in existence at the same time: this runs counter to the purpose of the legislation, which is harmonisation and the removal of as many obstacles as possible to the working of a true single market. As regards the indication of country of origin, under the current legislation, this information must be given when failure to do so could mislead the consumer. There is also provision for there always being voluntary labelling. Going further may involve a financial cost and administrative cost for companies, without bringing the consumer any significant and clear benefit. On the use of different languages, I have to say that the Commission’s proposal matches up with the existing directive, which has worked well and not caused problems. Reopening this debate could be dangerous and unnecessary, and could cause problems with the movement of products. Pilar Ayuso,

 Mr President, thrombin is an additive that can be used to stick meat because the fact is that there are no technological or food safety problems related to its use. Indeed, it is already used in some countries. The proposed amendment to the annex states that meat processed with thrombin can be sold pre-packed and labelled; thus, the consumer will not be deceived, which is the basic principle of the resolution. Whatever the case, I would like to ask the Commissioner if the European Commission can commit to products that contain thrombin not being able to be considered as imitations as a result of a suitable label, especially within the framework of the present study of the proposed Regulation on the food information provided to the consumer.

Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Jiménez García-Herrera, I would first of all like to highlight the work done by the rapporteurs – Mr Mikolášik and Mr Perello – and all the work that they have done to reach the best possible compromise for a transplant policy in the European Union. I would also like to highlight the contribution made by the Spanish Presidency and by Dr Matesanz, the Director of the Spanish National Transplant Organisation, because Spain is currently the world leader in terms of donations, with 34.4 for every million inhabitants. This is solely due to the constant improvement in organisation and to the measures that have been taken to raise awareness among the population about organ donation. We need to achieve this for the whole of the European Union: increase the number of donations, ensure that all transplants are done to the same quality standards, and also promote cooperation between all the Member States. We also need to ensure that every donation is voluntary and not rewarded, with the exceptions listed by Commissioner Dalli, in order to combat organ trafficking, which is entirely linked to a scarcity of organs. The action plan can contribute to this by helping to solve the shortage of organs and improving public access to transplants. The solution that has been reached for living donors is very important, as we cannot forget that living donations are complementary and have been shown to be effective even if there is no genetic relationship between the donor and the recipient.

Mr President, I want to begin by congratulating the Commissioner, because she works tirelessly in this area – I can vouch for that – especially given that this topic that we are discussing is really very complicated. I would also add the following. There is one area, Commissioner, in which we have demonstrated that we definitely can reduce emissions –indeed, we are seeing its positive impact on growth, competitiveness and, therefore, job creation – and in which Europe is a leader in the technological sphere and is carrying out many actions with specific objectives: that area is energy efficiency. I have said it before and I will say it again now. I believe that Doha, like the last COP in Durban, is a great opportunity for Europe, and the European Union, to head up the development of a road map for energy efficiency, with different types of goals, with common actions, with deadlines, etc. This really needs a precise structure and framework, and the European Union, more than anyone, has an undeniable opportunity to pioneer a road map for energy efficiency.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, what we are debating today are two reports: one by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and another by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The aim of these reports is, among other things, to convey to the Commission Parliament’s views on shale gas so that at a later date, as the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Potočnik, has said, the Commission can present a report on a series of measures relating to this energy source to enable harmonised action within the European Union. I believe that both rapporteurs have put forward the points of view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy in a very reasonable manner. Logically their perspectives are not exactly the same. In the case of the two Commissioners, they have set out their vision with a great deal of balance and in a measured way, which is essential for any debate such as this to take place. Someone said before I took the floor that one cannot debate using emotions and when emotions are running high. I ask you who can name or talk about a single energy source that does not carry risks and opportunities for developing the benefits that it brings. The same applies to this one. If humanity had rejected every advance, every encounter, every discovery of the possibility of developing an energy source solely due to the risks that it carried, we would have made no progress at all. We have to insist much more that the technology is as good as possible, that there is investment into research and that this new source of energy can be developed, with all the guarantees in place, in a measured way and without emotion.

Mr President, Commissioner, please allow me to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Kariņš, and all the shadow rapporteurs, who took the decision to continue moving forward during the negotiation in the trialogues, which was fraught with difficulties, and described so well by Mr Kariņš. I would say that thanks to that effort and determination, we now have a mechanism that, for the first time, allows information and communication to be exchanged between Member States and the Commission regarding intergovernmental agreements in the field of energy that are reached in those Member States. I believe the idea is to have constant knowledge of the supply map or the energy supply networks and it is very positive, therefore, for the improved management of energy supply in the European Union. When it comes to this regulation, if I had to use a simile, I would say we are paving the way to progressing more quickly in developing the internal energy market. If we throw this opportunity away and do not start paving the way, as is the desire of a certain political group in the House, we would simply be missing a golden opportunity. After a time, we would find ourselves in the same situation as today, but much further down the line. I trust, therefore, there will be a lot of parliamentary support for this proposal tomorrow. I thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs once again for their contribution. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, this is undoubtedly one of the most important legislative contributions in the field of energy in this parliamentary term. Ultimately, there will be few other things that will have the same significance as this Energy Efficiency Directive, and this is as a result of tenacity and hard work. It is as a result of the work done by the rapporteur, but also by shadow rapporteurs who have done truly admirable work, and I therefore congratulate them all. This directive basically has three objectives: it will help to make the European Union less of an energy island, it will help to make climate change targets a reality, and it will also help to develop an energy efficiency market that will make it possible to have greater economic growth through the right technologies. I would, however, like to highlight one thing which I think is the major contribution that Parliament is making to this directive, which is flexibility: flexibility in the 1.5% savings target for energy distributors and sellers, or the target of renovating 3% of buildings; and the flexibility that Member States have to apply alternative measures. This is the key, because there is a great deal of diversity within the European Union. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

 Mr President, allow me to also begin by personally congratulating Ms Niebler for having led so professionally and so successfully, on Parliament’s behalf, the third regulation on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union, now known as ‘Roaming III’. Not only has it been a success – as far as I can see – by substantially lowering the upper limits of what operators can charge consumers for mobile services when they are in another EU Member State, but the proposal for a regulation that we will vote on in this plenary session also includes other measures such as, for example, extending transparency clauses to European consumers travelling to non-Member States. However, above all, the greatest merit of the Roaming III Regulation is – in my view – its desire to become obsolete and create a competitive market for roaming services themselves, where it will no longer be necessary to regulate the situation in each of the different 27 markets every two years, but rather the situation in the single market, which should represent the European Union. This regulation, which we will vote on tomorrow, will not only be limited on this occasion to establishing new maximum tariffs that mobile phone operators must respect when European consumers travel outside the European Union, but, for the first time, we are tackling the situation – in my view, in a much more intelligent way – by establishing a competitive market. If the structural measures proposed in the regulation are successful, we European consumers will have the option of taking out a roaming contract with a different operator to the one providing us with mobile services in our own country, and we will be able to do this simply and keep our phone number. It is an essential contribution to the development of the digital single market. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am just going to go over two points very quickly. The first is possibly the most discussed issue in this report and that which has led to the most disagreement: whether or not to deal with the emissions trading mechanism. It is clear that it is suffering like any other ‘market’, and it is suffering due to the downturn, but I think it would be wrong to intervene in this market. To intervene to try to improve prices, as is done in other sectors, would be a serious error. More growth is needed. What we have to do is give it a boost, so that we can emerge from the crisis and then the emissions market will return to how it was. Secondly, when it comes to the Roadmap, as has been said here, there are a lot of uncertainties. If I had to draw up a map with different roads to take us to the final objective, which would be a low-carbon economy, there is one road, one route that is the main route: that of energy efficiency. In this area, we can indeed say and plan many things. We have reached agreement on the Energy Efficiency Directive, with a huge effort made by all the parliamentary groups. This is the same agreement that my group and I would like to see reflected in today’s vote on the report we are debating. I honestly believe it is worth it. We managed it for energy efficiency, why can we not do the same with this report? Pilar del Castillo Vera,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (ES) 
Madam President, Commissioner, I think that your explanation was a very logical one, full of common sense. The thing is that sometimes such explanations, which are really very sound, compete with reflections that are equally sound. I think that what we do in Parliament at this point serves as a wake-up call to ensure that an instrument that has had a history of success does not disappear because of theoretical solutions which could in principle, theoretically, turn out to be more efficient but which would, in any event, put an end to the development of a tool that has made a very real contribution so that many programmes derive from it and have very important consequences for energy saving. I am not going to mention them all but there is no doubt that actions such as European Local ENergy Assistance (ELENA), Solar Keymark or GreenLight are success stories. All this has always been based upon a fundamental pillar, namely, innovation, even in these especially severe times of crisis in Europe. It is impossible for societies that do not make innovation the driving force of their development to survive in such a competitive, global society and here we have before us a tool that has proved useful precisely for the purpose of developing innovation in the energy sector. Therefore, Commissioner, our modest contribution is to insist that a tool such as this must not be wasted because it has been tried and tested and, accordingly, we have to give extremely careful consideration to the fact that this intelligent energy tool for Europe could disappear. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we are faced with one of the issues that forms the basis for the success of the Internet, namely the competitive nature and neutral character of the network. In this sense, everything that is related to that aspect is extremely important. I would say that the resolution we are proposing and debating this afternoon is, without a doubt, particularly balanced. It is in accordance with the Commission, in the sense that, when information exists that gives us an indication that a change is occurring to the neutral character of the network, then that would be the moment to propose some kind of legislative action, but that, in the meantime, it is necessary to wait to see what is contained in the report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications. I would like to add something else: there are three conditions sine qua non
, which, in my view, are essential for guaranteeing neutrality on the network. Firstly, there needs to be a truly competitive market for service and telecommunications operators. Secondly, the user needs to be able to change supplier quickly and easily. Otherwise, without a doubt, the market will be very weak from a competitive point of view. Third is transparency. Transparency means, however, that users must be properly informed of all the criteria used by network operators, so that they can really know whether or not they are of interest to them or, on the contrary, whether or not it is of interest to them to switch supplier, as was previously commented. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, I would also like to address Mr Barroso, even though he is not here right now, via the Commissioner. I believe that a reasonable work programme has been set, as in previous years. However, what I feel is missing is the sense of urgency, and this worries me. In many countries, of course including Spain, my own Member State, people get up every morning driven by the urgency of the reforms that must be carried out: in the job market, in budgetary stability, public debt, and so on. What we have here is a programme that, to my way of thinking, lacks that sense of urgency. The main thing it lacks is, essentially, the power of the European Union project to help develop growth and employment, which is the internal market, and the digital internal market as a variant of this. We urgently need to address everything that continues to hinder the development of the internal market today – and there is still a lot – in terms of the transposition and development of directives (such as the Services Directive), and many other aspects that prevent us from unifying and integrating the extraordinary legislative fragmentation currently hampering the development of that market. My main message is that you need to regain the sense of urgency, because if you do not, there is not much that the European Union can do. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I believe the climate change conference in Durban has an advantage over its immediate predecessors: there is no doubt whatsoever that achieving a binding international agreement is impossible. This should enable energy to be channelled into proposals and joint lines of action that will indeed allow us to progress in practice towards the goal of emissions cuts. So this is good news, because we were not in this position in Cancún, much less when the Copenhagen climate summit was held. I believe this is the time for the European Union to become the regional leader in energy efficiency proposals, which really can unite the work of a great number of other countries, from the most developed and the richest, to the least developed and the poorest. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fighting against climate change by boosting energy efficiency brings incredible opportunities in all areas, and I sincerely believe that it is time for the European Union to become the leader in combating climate change through energy efficiency.

 Mr President, Commissioner, whenever there has previously been any discussion about SMEs, the focus has been on intervention in financial matters, the lack of liquidity and problems in accessing credit, because that is really the main problem. It is the main problem for governments, SMEs, all companies, banks and, to a large extent, I would say it is the main problem, above all, for each and every member of society. However, allow me to focus on one dimension that I feel is strategically fundamental, and that has only been partially touched upon. It is to do with the internal market. Over recent weeks, the European institutions have been insisting on the importance of taking a decisive step forward in developing the internal market as a strategic element or strategic factor in overcoming the crisis. If we look at the relationship between the internal market and SMEs today, we can see that only 23% of these companies engage in cross-border trade, and that only 13% export outside the European Union, and this gives us a clear idea of how far we still have to go in this area. The problem is that it is very difficult to tackle the current legislative fragmentation on basic issues in the internal market. When SMEs compare the costs and profits, it is really very hard for them to finance the fragmentation in the internal market today, and this is something that must be resolved. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

 Mr President, we are discussing a report that the Commission presented when the occasion arose on the strategy for tackling a matter of special importance, namely, the volatility of prices of raw materials and the increase in demand for raw materials on the part of developing countries, especially China. For my group’s part, we wish to express our thanks for the Bütikofer report and to say that to a very large degree we share the views expressed in it because we consider that it develops, brings into focus and adopts a truly satisfactory approach to raw materials and the strategy for their use, access and development. In that sense, we think that the report we are debating adopts a balanced approach to access to raw materials both within and outside the EU, raw materials which are fundamental and critical. We think that adequate emphasis is placed on the importance of using sources of raw materials efficiently, and that a number of very interesting proposals are put forward for improving recycling practices in the EU. In addition, I would like to point out on behalf of my group that in our opinion, bearing in mind that maintaining growth is fundamental, the issue should not be tackled from the point of view of reducing consumption. Economic growth must be maintained and promoted and, accordingly, what we need to consider are policies for efficient use of these raw materials and policies that truly incentivise rational use of the same. Likewise, we believe that the impact on speculation will be positive because, as a result of the transparency measures proposed by the Commission, we will face a more transparent market than the one in which we find ourselves today and, accordingly, one with reduced scope for speculation.

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have to be careful how debates develop. When the Commissioner is constantly being interrupted, there is then an avalanche of questions from other Members of the House, and it is very difficult for the debate to remain on the subject that is being examined and in relation to the points the Commissioner has raised, rather than other Members’ wishes. The first thing I want to say is that some Members of this House need to show a little humility and a little common sense, because they make it appear that they are the only ones that have ever thought about nuclear safety and the only ones who are worried about the future of their children and humanity. The 58 reactors in France or those in the United Kingdom or those in many other countries do not mean that the French or others may be more stupid or less intelligent, or that the future of their children does not worry them, or that they have never thought about nuclear safety. Ladies and gentlemen, nuclear safety is something that is being continually worked on in all nuclear plants in relation to every nuclear reactor. There are many top-quality professionals, not people sitting here spouting hot air, but rather people that have been working on these issues day in day out since the beginning. Is a joint review of stress tests now required? I am completely in agreement, and I have to say that some of the people that are now talking about these issues refused to endorse this Parliament’s joint resolution on this subject, which was supported by the majority of the groups in the House. On that basis, a distinction must be made: we are talking about stress tests and not the abolition of nuclear energy. Those will be national debates and they will have to be carried out there. This is why, speaking of stress tests, because some people do not want to talk about it, they only speak or discuss this in one debate or another with an undertone of eliminating nuclear energy, I have to say that Commissioner Oettinger has done an extraordinary job in a very short time. He has already agreed and carried out, in practice, a series of measures and tests that will show us the extent of the situation we are now in. Therefore, Commissioner, congratulations, we cannot have anything other than appreciation for you in how you have acted. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, today, we find ourselves discussing in this House a joint proposal for a resolution on the revision of the Small Business Act, which the Commission submitted in February. The relationship between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the economy can be defined in many ways, but in a sense, they are the axis around which any economic system revolves, in this case, the European economies. If they are strong, the economy will do well; if they are weak, the economy will do badly. SMEs generate jobs, growth and, accordingly, prosperity for society. I shall refer to three factors that seem to me to be fundamental to achieving a strong network of enterprises. First, the adoption of information and communication technology and the development of technologies such as online administration or cloud computing, which save money, reduce costs and effort and, therefore, improve the competitiveness of SMEs. Second, innovation, which is equally fundamental in this sector. Accordingly, up-and-coming enterprises in the small and medium-sized business sector must be strongly incentivised. Third, SMEs must be able to participate fully in the internal market, both in terms of cross-border public tendering and as regards all other features of the internal market, which are capable of providing extraordinary benefits to SMEs in terms of their competitiveness but are currently failing to do so. Finally, after all this comes the value of entrepreneurship, a social value which must be strong since, if it is not, the whole network will be weak. In this area, both governments and the European Union have much to do, principally through education. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, our colleague, Mr Hökmark, because his work is excellent and, in addition to being excellent, it has great vision for the future, which I think makes it particularly valuable. However, please also allow me to thank, as he did, all the shadow rapporteurs. The result of all this work was the unanimous backing that this report received in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Of course, the report before us is guided by an objective, which is none other than a way of making the European economy more competitive in a global world. That is the key objective of this report and I therefore believe that it is extraordinarily appropriate. I am not going to go into the details, but I would like to focus on two or three aspects that I consider key. First of all, we are in a situation – and this report points this out – in which wireless broadband through the 800 MHz allocation for mobile communications across Europe will be a reality. However the report goes much further: it is thinking more about the future. We are talking about the 700 MHz frequency band, which also has an extraordinary capacity for mobile telephony and its development. I believe that is why we also have to view and evaluate the proposals made in the report very positively. It is not a trivial issue: the spectrum relating to economic activities currently represents 3% of European gross domestic product (GDP) and that is just the start. I should like to mention the importance of video’s exponential growth as an element of communication between different people, and between different institutions and companies. Right now, video represents 40% of world traffic and that is only the start: by 2014, it will represent 91% of end-user traffic. As such, the report positions itself realistically in a vision of an extraordinary future, so I believe that we should give it our full support the day after tomorrow. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need energy to eat, travel, study, cure diseases, and for many other things. That energy has always come from a variety of sources. In some cases, from the oldest sources, such as hydropower, fossil energy, and even nuclear energy; in other cases, from the most modern, for example, renewables. In addition to this, technologies are being developed to bring about increased safety, in some cases, or to offer greater efficiency, as in the case of renewable energies. There is also research that has not yet been applied, such as carbon storage, or that which is expected to – and will – lead us to fusion power. All of this is necessary, ladies and gentlemen, because human life has operated and developed on the basis of constant improvements to the resources used and the research that made this possible. Communication, energy, medicine and study are based on that: the continual improvement of all our resources. Recently, the tsunami and the earthquake that caused it resulted in serious damage for the people of Japan, including victims, missing people and material losses, as well as significant damage to the Fukushima plant. With all that in mind, what we have to do is improve safety. Tomorrow, this House will vote on a joint resolution, on which the vast majority of the parliamentary groups have agreed. It expresses what unites us, not what divides us. I would ask the groups to remain loyal to the content of the proposal and not to allow their own interests to get in the way of the common interest or of the shared view that we have achieved on this proposal. That is our responsibility for tomorrow. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would also like to start by thanking Mr Lange for his efforts in bringing together so many differing opinions and visions, a situation that is quite common in Parliament. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various political groups. In fact, this report tries to answer a question that has already been under consideration for a long time: do European industries have any future in a global world? I think the answer is yes. Yes, because European Union countries are proving that they do. Yes, because there are also specific European industrial sectors that are proving that they do. All of this has to do with a number of aspects: some are related to the job market, because we need a flexible job market, not a rigid one; others are related to productivity, financial policies and tax incentives. However, allow me to highlight three that are now closely linked to the European Union itself. Firstly, the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. These are two key issues. Enterprise and innovation are key elements of the future of any industry in Europe. Particular attention should be paid to young entrepreneurs. Secondly, strengthening the internal market and making sure it is competitive and, internally, based on free competition. Therefore, the subsidies still being given to transport, energy, and publicly owned businesses should be reduced so as to ensure free competition within the European internal market. Thirdly, respecting the conditions of competition within the international framework: when it comes to environmental policies and product sourcing, it is vital to compete on equal terms. We do not want protectionism within the European Union, nor do we want protectionism when our industry competes with third countries and third regions. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission and the parliamentary delegation, led by our fellow Member Mr Leinen, on the work that they did in Cancún, a meeting that I was unfortunately unable to attend in the end. I believe that Cancún and its results can be viewed, along the lines of what my colleague, Mr Seeber, was saying, from the perspective of Copenhagen: Cancún viewed from the Copenhagen perspective. The first conclusion from this perspective is that there was a fundamental differentiating factor. In Copenhagen, the expectations were very high, and in Cancún the expectations were much more realistic, as a result of which the assessment of Copenhagen was very negative, while the assessment of Cancún, both by those who took part and by the media in general, was very positive. Cancún learned lessons from Copenhagen, and I think that is the first, very interesting, conclusion. I believe that measures have been taken and agreements reached which are not, of course, ground-breaking, but which could be very interesting from the point of view of efficiency. Among other things, I think that the creation of a committee and a technology network to promote technological cooperation is extremely important. Here, we are going to adopt a report during this sitting on energy efficiency, which is one of the fundamental keys to effectively combating climate change. Also, I think that matters such as the World Bank being more involved or official recognition of the actions of countries to reduce emissions returning to the procedure and framework of the United Nations are very positive. Finally, I would like to say that there is one year to go before we get to South Africa. It would be a very good idea if, in the same way that Cancún learnt from Copenhagen, we now learnt from Kyoto, and achieved an international frame of reference for an agreement against climate change that is more flexible, more transparent, more efficient and more integrative.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job. Her report is, of course, as ambitious as it is extensive, and I must say that it is the result of the tough and successful negotiations that resulted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy adopting it practically unanimously. Continuing with this subject, I would like to point out something of which we are all aware, but which there is no harm in saying: the energy situation in Europe is not exactly an optimum one. Not only are we increasingly dependent on energy imports obtained from outside Europe, but we are also having to deal with the huge investments needed in our energy infrastructures at a time when Europe is still suffering the consequences of the crisis. This is all in the context of not yet having managed to apply our own energy legislation. Now in this parliamentary term we have an instrument that was not available in the previous one. The Treaty of Lisbon not only provides a series of clear objectives such as the internal energy market, security of supply, energy efficiency and promoting energy networks, but it also gives the European Union a legal framework and a sound legal basis – Article 194 – for acting in the field of energy policy. In this new context in which we are having this debate, I ask all my fellow Members to support this report, which proposes a series of measures aimed at guaranteeing energy supply and full implementation of the existing legislation and programmes. It also stresses the need to invest in research, promotes the development of pan-European energy grids and gives the creation of the internal energy market the priority it deserves. Thank you very much, and I ask you all to support this report tomorrow. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE
).

Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, I would like to start by saying that I felt that both speeches by the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner gave a very different perspective on the Cancún conference to their perspective on the Copenhagen conference. It is a more realistic, much more viable perspective, and there is therefore much more potential for it to be effective. If Copenhagen was the all-or-nothing summit – as the President-in-Office of the Council said – Cancún must be the summit that provides a variety of viable and efficient options. The battle against climate change has two fundamental features: firstly it has to be global, involving all the major polluters, from the United States to Brazil, China and India. Secondly, it has to be a series of measures that are effective in their impact on climate change, we need to be able to measure that impact, and they must not be detrimental to economic growth. In this respect we also need to have the humility to recognise that the global challenge of tackling climate change offers a variety of technological and political options. There are and may be binding agreements, there are sectoral agreements, there is technology transfer and there is support for research. All the options need to be brought into play, along with a radical increase in energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy and of society. This is the only way that we will be able to effectively tackle the problems of climate change. In this respect, if Cancún is the summit that produces a variety of viable and efficient agreements, it will have been a great success. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, in this time of crisis, in which we find ourselves, there are two main types of policies and actions: preventive policies and actions and stimulative policies and actions. Preventive policies are those that currently concern the supervision of financial services, governance and strengthening governance. In other words, anything that is going to alert us to the fact that there are problems before the problems overwhelm the European economies. However, the second type of policies – stimulative policies – are essential. There are three fundamental aspects of these policies, Mr Barroso, Mr Wathelet. Naturally, there are more, but I am going to highlight three: research and innovation, the development of a digital society – in other words, the digital agenda – and the internal market. The first, research and innovation, is where I find the work programme presented by the Commission to be lacking. President Barroso said earlier that the specific programmes will come in mid-2011, but I do not think that is enough. I can assure you that I and my group would very much have liked to see a reference to the Eighth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, which does not feature in your proposal.

 Madam President, Commissioners, Mr Magnette, there can be no doubt that the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico has raised awareness of these types of situations, while exposing the need to analyse them in depth and to take measures to prevent or counteract them. These things also occur in Europe. They have occurred. I am a national of a country, Spain, where not many years ago, we had a problem – in the north of the country – with spillages of this type due to problems with transportation, in this case, a problem with tankers. When we find ourselves faced with a situation of this type, the risk is to act emotively and without thinking all that much, and therefore without any balance in decision making, which may have undesirable consequences. I believe that what the Commissioners explained to us, the ten points that Commissioner Oettinger set out, is a very important and interesting approximation of the problem, and that it is along the right lines. There is a need to act forcefully with regard to civil responsibility and partnership, arrive at joint positions with the International Maritime Organisation, harmonise the legislation of Member States better, etc., but this needs to be done in such a way that the actions we take do not have any undesirable consequences. What needs to be done therefore needs to be assessed very well, including economically, together with its impact. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, many fellow Members have wondered why the Lisbon Agenda failed and whether we should start by analysing that failure in order to take the next steps. In my view, the problem with the Lisbon Agenda was that it was ultimately nothing more than a symbol enclosed in a bubble, which was not implemented at all in practice. In the end we found that on the one hand there was a theory, the Lisbon Agenda, about which we were all talking, and on the other hand there was the practice, which had nothing to do with it. Therefore, in my view, based on this experience the Europe 2020 strategy must be a new agenda that can only be taken forward if there is a resounding commitment – I would stress, a resounding commitment – from all the institutions: the European political institutions and the national political institutions. This commitment also needs to be one that can be verified and evaluated; it needs to be one that we have information about and an immediate capacity to correct if the commitments are not being fulfilled when there are failures. This is so that we do not find ourselves in any situation of extreme circumstances. Either we all understand that this joint project needs these instruments in order to move forward, or we will soon be in a similar situation. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, this is a debate on an issue on which there is generally a great deal of agreement, so it is not one of those debates in which there are radically different positions, but rather the positions are different in simple terms. We heard this in the speech by Mr López Garrido, and in the speech by the Commissioner, and it is reflected in the resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow in Parliament with the support of all the political groups. Having said this, there are a series of problems to resolve before electric cars can be fully efficient, and the task that we now have in front of us is to focus on seeing how we can resolve these problems as soon as possible so that electric cars can also become part of the whole project of having more sustainable and efficient energy consumption. In this respect I would like to highlight one of the issues that has been mentioned, which is also in the resolution, which is the issue of research. There are still a series of fundamental problems linked to the efficiency of the batteries and recharging, as well as the problems of standardisation, interoperability, and so on, which have a long way to go. In order for this ground to be covered as soon as possible, I think that it is essential, as in so many other aspects linked to energy and other issues, that efforts are focused on research. This does require an enormous effort from a financial point of view, both from the European institutions and from the national institutions. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Madam President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso – who is not here, but whom I am also addressing – the truth is that it has been very good to see you together and, in my opinion, this is because we have seen that there is a move towards and a focus on what should be the foundations of the common strategy in the next ten years and, in my view, this is extremely important. What most interested me about the proposal that we have seen in writing and what you have said is that there only need to be a few objectives: only the top-priority objectives; that they need to be tangible, that we need to be able to measure them and they need to be constantly evaluated in order to see whether or not we are making progress in that direction. I think this is fundamental, and it is a substantial change from the Lisbon Strategy. I am going to highlight one objective: the internal market. The European internal market was conceived more than 20 years ago. Twenty years later, there is a long way to go before we have a truly internal European market in the majority of sectors. In some cases, this is because they are very new sectors, such as the digital market, but in other cases, there is such a degree of fragmentation and such barriers that we are depriving the European economy of the large-scale framework that it needs in order to be able to really develop all the competitiveness that it needs, which will bring about growth, which, in turn, will bring about employment. Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, we need a great deal of political impetus: ‘business as usual’ can no longer be a tool. We need a great deal of leadership, and you have a big responsibility. You do, of course, have my full support for making this possible. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

Mr President, I would firstly like to recognise the effort made, and also the enthusiasm shown by both the Commission and the Council and, of course, Parliament over such a long period throughout this programme to combat climate change. I would like to say that there are a series of certainties that should map out our route for us. The first one is this: we need everyone to take part, especially all the countries that are major polluters. The second near-certainty is this: based on all the information we have, it appears that it will be very difficult for a legally binding agreement to be reached in Copenhagen, in the same way as the agreements on the percentage of emissions are, of course, binding. This reality should not, however, cause us to give up, because pessimism results from failing to acknowledge reality. On the contrary, optimism is based on acknowledging reality. What should we do in Copenhagen, essentially? Of course, we should not forget the possibility of reaching that general agreement. As we are aware of the situation and the possibilities that exist, however, I think we should concentrate on sectoral agreements that are really valid, with viable objectives. I have in mind an agreement on deforestation, an agreement on aid for emerging countries and developing countries, but most importantly, an agreement on technology transfer. I also think it would be an extremely good idea to have agreements to promote programmes so that the industrial sectors that consume the most energy worldwide can reach agreements on emissions, whichever country they are in. This would also make our economies more competitive. To conclude, I would like to stress that optimism is based on realism and effectiveness is based on setting viable objectives. This should be our guide at all times. Pilar del Castillo Vera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks to my fellow Members, and in this case, mainly to the rapporteur, Mrs Trautmann, because she has really done an extraordinary job. You had to be there to know how much was achieved in this final stage, which resulted in success in the conciliation process. I would say that at the moment, we are in an excellent position to begin to tackle a future that is, in a sense, revolutionary, or should be revolutionary. We finally have – or we are soon going to have – a regulatory framework that lays some very good foundations for putting the development of the internet, the digital society and the digital economy at the forefront of our objectives. This framework provides good protection for consumers, promotes their rights and also provides security for investors. I think, however, that it is very important for us to now look decisively towards the future. We must look decisively beyond 2010 so that we can devote all our efforts to setting a digital agenda beyond 2010. The key objectives of this digital agenda should include: enabling everyone, as consumers and citizens, to have all the resources needed to access and participate through the internet and, of course, developing an internal digital market that is open and competitive. This is an absolutely essential objective if we want to put the European economy where it should be in the global world of today. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE
).  
– (ES) 
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission. With regard to the subject that we are debating, there are some certainties and a set of uncertainties. The first certainty, or the first common element, is that there is now a major convergence of opinion that emissions need to be reduced and that clean energy sources need to be developed. The second certainty is that there needs to be a global approach to or way of dealing with the problem. Therefore, the countries that emit the most CO2
 into the atmosphere need to take part in all international agreements. The major producers of CO2
 include the United States, China, India and Brazil. The third certainty is that the European Union is putting a proposal on the table that is an obligatory system of targets: 20% or 30%. The fourth certainty is that there are no reasonable signs, for various reasons, that the major CO2
 emitting countries are going to accept an agreement of this nature, and that is the reality. There is not such a lack of optimism if we acknowledge the reality; pessimism wins the day if we do not know the reality. It is only by acknowledging the reality that we can create an effective policy, and it will be a more optimistic policy. I think that the European Union, as it takes the lead on this issue, has a duty to put additional measures and additional proposals on the table. Japan has been mentioned here, and we have to talk about the success of projects such as the Sector Focus project, which affect the most polluting industries. On the basis of a process of benchmarking, such projects have achieved extraordinary objectives in Japan. These are the realistic ways of tackling climate change. Copenhagen is an opportunity, but it will only be an opportunity for efficiency rather than rhetoric if we base it on reality. Pilar del Castillo Vera  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being very clear in your explanation of the current situation in relation to Nabucco and its potential and viability – seemingly in the short term, according to what you said – and also for the information on the Desertec project. There can be no doubt that the Sun is an extraordinary source of energy. Converting this energy into energy that can be used by people is an area which has seen major developments in the last 20 years. However, there is also no doubt that we still have a way to go before the full potential and viability of this source can be technologically assured, particularly in projects such as the Desertec project which we are now discussing. This project is very welcome and we must therefore support it and keep moving forward in order to solve the technological problems. However, I must really draw your attention to the fact that, when talking about energy efficiency, and particularly about security of supply and therefore diversification of energy sources, one particular energy source is ignored to a certain extent. I am of course talking about nuclear energy. This energy source is systematically being discriminated against, because it does not fit with what is happening in many EU countries or with global trends or with mankind’s current energy needs. This situation must be turned on its head. We must adopt an attitude of considering all possible energy sources in terms of the role that they can play. Here in this Parliament we cannot so obviously turn our backs on this reality. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to use this minute to mention the tragic consequences of the heavy rains which have fallen in southern and south-eastern Spain, particularly in the region of Valencia, Murcia and part of Andalusia. There was torrential rainfall on 28 September 2012 which caused very considerable damage across the whole agricultural sector. Thousands of hectares of crops were flattened, and many farms were completely ruined. The livestock sector also suffered losses, and damage was caused to the municipal road network, to street lighting, homes, buildings, and to industrial and commercial premises. I would also like to stress the difficulties which were already being experienced in Lorca, a town which, as you know, suffered a powerful earthquake a year ago, along with Puerto Lumbreras. Those two towns, those two Spanish municipalities in the region of Murcia, and all those in these and other regions, are seeking the solidarity of the European Union in order to be able to carry on.

 Madam President, the coastal regions, seas and oceans are undoubtedly of fundamental importance for the economic growth of the European Union and all its Member States. Following the Commission’s communication, an ‘Action Plan for an integrated maritime policy for the European Union’, known as the ‘Blue Book’, we are now in the current situation where the idea of an integrated maritime policy is welcome, and what it does and aims to do is certainly to make better use of the opportunities the sea provides. They know that this idea will form the basis for specific environmental and maritime transport policies which are so important for all these areas and for energy, research, fishing and regional policies. All of these aspects are, of course, vital for all these regions. I myself, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, fully support the proposal for a regulation and, furthermore, we believe that the EUR 40 million allocated for the current 2011-2013 period is sufficient. I should also like to say that it would be necessary for this funding to continue into the future, after 2014, since we need to consolidate the process that has been initiated and thereby ensure the continuation of such a promising course of action. I should also like to say that there should be a consistent approach to all the seas within the European Union so that we can see the range of projects and gain real first-hand knowledge of what the issues are in each sea basin. Clearly, the problems of the North Sea are not the same as those of the Mediterranean; hence, it would be valuable to adopt a consistent approach in order to discover more about this diversity. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the various opinions that have been drafted to finalise a programme which we see as of great importance for the future of the European Union.

Madam President, 80 million people, 16% of the population of the European Union, suffer from some kind of disability. This is why Mr Kósa’s report is so timely. It is an important report that discusses the European Disability Strategy and analyses it in detail. I would like to highlight three ideas in this report. The first of these is inclusive education, which is necessary so that each student’s individual characteristics can be taken into account, as required by Article 24 of the United Nations Convention. The second idea is the need for the employment market to open up to people with disabilities, so that we can meet the Europe 2020 strategy target of 75% employment. The third idea is that the economic crisis must never be an excuse to discriminate against disabled people. Lastly, other significant ideas in the report include a single European mobility card that would allow all benefits and rights to be mutually recognised in the Member States, and a similarly unified travel card to consolidate our efforts to help this group.

 Mr President, on 29 June this year the Majorcan pilot Antonio Planas, who was 49 years old, lost his life, the victim of a Taliban terrorist attack, along with 20 other people in Kabul. Antonio was married and he was the father of an eight-year-old girl. He worked for a Turkish airline and his death took place outside the EU. I am using this minute to point out that all those Europeans who are the victims of a terrorist attack outside the EU do not qualify for the forms of compensation that they would qualify for if the attack had taken place within a Member State. Imagine the position of Antonio’s daughter and his widow: they are victims of terrorism but they cannot enjoy the same rights as if the attack had taken place in Spain. Therefore, I would like to seek protection for all those Europeans who are the victims of terrorism when the death takes place outside the territory of the EU. In Spain a law is being formulated, the law for the recognition and comprehensive protection of victims of terrorism, which appears to be capable of correcting that grave error and of rehabilitating and protecting all victims of terrorism equally, in favour of memory, dignity, justice and truth, which are doubtless the ideas that underlie the law itself.

 Mr President, cohesion policy has undoubtedly contributed to increased productivity in all regions of the EU and to eliminating regional disparities and there is no doubt that it has proved fundamental for all citizens and that it is helping – and will continue to help – to combat the economic and financial crisis Europe is suffering. This is why the fifth cohesion report is so timely. There are three key ideas. The first is that gross domestic product should be supplemented by other indicators on the part of national and regional authorities. The second idea is that there should be an intermediate category so that all regions that do not come under convergence and do not manage to achieve competitiveness can be treated in a similar way when similar situations arise and so that these regions do not ever suffer a sudden change. The third idea is to reinforce Objective 3. I wish to make two requests. The maximum distance of 150 kilometres should be removed to enable many regions such as, for example, the Balearic Islands to access cross-border cooperation. My second point is that the report says that the working languages of the EU are French, English and German. That is not so. The 23 languages of the EU are what make us rich and diverse.

 Madam President, in January, the European Commission approved the strategy to tackle early school dropout as a key contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy to fight the school dropout problem across the entire European Union and reduce rates by at least 10%. Strangely, this strategy does not make any reference to disabled people, and this is why I would like to use this minute to make an appeal, since the education ministers of all the Member States will be meeting in Brussels on 2 and 4 May to discuss the global strategies around this issue. I would like to ask that the issue of disabled people be included within this strategy, because it is of fundamental importance for this group of people all over Europe to receive continuous education and therefore to be able to access the labour market. Article 24 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that disabled people are not, under any circumstances, to be excluded from the general education system.

Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the working group led by the chair of the Committee on Regional Development, which has made it possible for us to have this debate today. We certainly all agree that cohesion policy is the essential element for achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and also for achieving European integration and achieving the economic, social and territorial cohesion set out in the Treaty of Lisbon that people are clamouring for so much. What we need to start doing now, in my view, is to see what mistakes we have made and improve what we have done so far. We all agree that the process needs to be much more flexible, there need to be fewer bureaucratic obstacles, and the controls need to be simpler. Also, the regions with specific difficulties, such as islands, mountainous areas, cross-border regions and outermost regions, must receive specific treatment. Gross domestic product must continue to be the main criterion, although there might be other indicators in other decision-making processes, and the regions and local bodies must play a fundamental role. It seems that we all agree on this. So we are going to go down this road, but the Commission should clarify for us whether this is indeed the road we should go down or whether it should be another one. It needs to clarify whether we are going to have the same budgets, which is absolutely essential in order for no one to lose out and for all the regions to be able to make progress in terms of innovation, competitiveness, development, income and progress, especially in a time of crisis when clarity is needed more than ever.

Mr President, I would first of all like to thank all those who signed this motion for a resolution, which is welcomed extremely warmly by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and in Spain, the country that we represent. We have the legal framework, which is Article 174(3) of the Treaty of Lisbon. We also have territorial cohesion, which is the new pillar that is set out in that treaty, and therefore we have the legal basis to step out and help these regions: mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas. In the case of mountain regions – as has been said here – we are talking about 90 million inhabitants; in the case of islands, there are 21 million people living on islands in 14 countries, and many millions more live in mountain regions. All of these areas share a very similar set of problems in terms of culture, education, transport and the environment. Specifically, there is one disadvantage that unites us all, which is in terms of transport. I come from the Balearic Islands, where the additional cost of transport has been calculated at 20%. This undoubtedly has repercussions on our industry, agriculture, strategic sectors, tourism and, in short, on the whole business sector: the entire economic fabric. It therefore affects our competitiveness. Therefore, if we then focus on resources, such as drinking water or land, which is limited, or raw materials such as energy or the living spaces in those areas, we will see that they undoubtedly result in a phenomenon of shortages and of a lack of economic diversification. We are therefore calling for the new financial perspectives to take into account the specific characteristics of these areas and for us to move from words to action – as has also been said here – which should be translated into budgets, and hence into greater territorial cohesion. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

Madam President, Article 3 of the Treaty of Lisbon gives the European Union responsibility for economic, social and territorial cohesion, and for solidarity between the Member States. That cohesion and, in particular, territorial cohesion, is therefore one of the Union’s main objectives in order to ensure harmonious development and remove regional disparities. The Treaty of Lisbon also mentions supporting the island regions. I am speaking because the Spanish Government has announced a cut in the subsidy for discounting flights to the Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla for residents. In other words, it intends to cut into discounts for residents. Residents of these regions see air travel as essential. It is not optional, but rather they depend on it as it is their only means of contact with the outside world, and therefore maintaining discounts will ensure that those regions have equal opportunities and can compete. I ask Parliament to support this territorial cohesion and I trust that it will make the Spanish Government reconsider removing these discounts. Rosa Estaràs Ferragut  (PPE

 Mr President, we approved the Lisbon Agenda with its very ambitious objectives in 2000. Some of these have been met, but a lot of them have not. There is no doubt that the regional funds contributed to the Lisbon Strategy. Ten years on, we find ourselves shaken by the worst economic crisis we can remember. I believe that this crisis has served to enable us to identify, in this new Europe 2020 strategy, where we went wrong, as well as enable us to improve so as to achieve better results. Firstly, we have learned that coordination between all governance levels is essential, as is clearly stated in Mr Cortés Lastra’s report. We have also learned that the contribution of regional funds is essential to meeting the objectives we are proposing. We believe that the combination of specific actions at all levels – European Union, national, regional and local authorities – is an absolute necessity. If we work together, we will be much stronger. It is also important that a Cohesion policy covering economic, social and territorial aspects be incorporated into the Europe 2020 strategy. I would also like to make an observation as regards the Cohesion policy issue here, namely that the bureaucratic procedures should be much more flexible and efficient. Furthermore, in the disability sector, that difference will have to be taken into account in some way. Finally, I would like to underline the important role to be played by European regions and towns and cities, and especially, the need to pay more attention to those areas with special needs, such as mountain areas, coastal areas and islands. In short, if we want to be successful, we have to be able to count on the European regions, the towns and the cities and on a reformed Cohesion policy in line with the new situation.

 Mr President, the closure of a large part of European airspace over recent weeks following the eruption of the Icelandic volcano has had serious consequences for the entire European economy. This is clearly the case for the passengers, airlines and airports of the aviation sector, but it is also true for the tourism sector. That is what I wanted to talk to you about. In Spain, this is our second-largest industry. In the islands I hail from, it is the main industry. There is huge concern for the effects of the volcanic cloud on the tourist industry. There is talk of losses of EUR 42 million a day. It has dealt a serious blow to the tourism sector, which is still concerned about what the future repercussions may be. Mr Tajani, the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship, has committed himself to study the losses in this sector. My request today would be for an urgent relief package both for these airlines and for the other businesses in the tourism sector, and for the tourism sector to be treated as a priority.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have taken the floor to highlight and condemn implementation of the Spanish Government’s Law on the Coastline, in particular, its effects on the island of Formentera. Formentera is one of the Balearic Islands. It is 19 kilometres long and has a perimeter of 69 kilometres. The implementation of this law will be positive in areas devastated by urban development. It will not, however, be beneficial for the island of Formentera, because it requires the elimination of most of the island’s tourist facilities, which means small family businesses will be seized. These facilities are the island’s livelihood and have been legally established for between 30 and 40 years. By way of example, I could mention the Hotel Rocabella, which was the first hotel on the island, or the bar and restaurant known as the Blue Bar, which is internationally renowned and has helped to promote the island abroad. Seventy per cent of these facilities would be affected by the implementation of the aforementioned law, despite having been established legally when they were set up. All this law would do would be to permit seizure. We therefore call for a fair demarcation system for the island of Formentera. I call on the Spanish Government to undertake a new demarcation, respecting private property, in line with the many rulings on the subject by the Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. Never again should a law like this one with retroactive effect be drawn up. It is causing a great deal of damage. In particular, it should be borne in mind that all these facilities were built with respect for the environment. Furthermore, the coast is protected under national and local legislation. It is not possible to build within 300 metres of the coast or to increase the amount of hotel accommodation. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate Mr Goerens on his excellent report. The Agenda for Change is an important roadmap for redefining development cooperation and for striving for better quality and effectiveness of aid, particularly in view of current changes in the new world order, the emergence of new international actors and the necessary process of fiscal consolidation into which we are forced by our current economic situation. We are pleased that the Commission is making poverty a core element of its differentiation policy. However, we deplore the fact that gross national income has been adopted as the key indicator for implementation of that policy. Mr President, 70 % of the people in this world whose income is below the poverty threshold live in middle-income countries. If we want to have a real impact on reducing this poverty, we need to take into account, in addition to wealth, other criteria such as the vulnerability of some of those countries, the lack of internal cohesion or the human development indicator. Many of these countries could also be key players today through triangular or South-South cooperation mechanisms, not to mention drivers of development for the future. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

 Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Cortés Lastra on his excellent report. Latin America is one of the regions of the world that has grown the most in recent years. As its largest global donor, the European Union has made a significant contribution to that development, and this is not the time to suddenly cut off our aid, but rather to do so gradually, so that those countries can consolidate their rule of law and continue to reduce their poverty figures. We need to maintain the levels of cooperation aid to Latin America as, despite achieving regional growth figures of more than 4%, it has the largest pockets of poverty in the world and the greatest levels of economic and social inequality. The European Union and Latin America share common values and interests and must move forward together in order to face up to the global challenges facing our societies, which are now more interdependent than ever.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the tragedy of Mali is the chronicle of a death foretold. One year ago, I had the honour of being the chief observer of an EU election observation mission in Niger; the Nigerien authorities – who knew exactly what they were talking about – and the few ambassadors posted there warned the European governments that there would be terrible consequences for all the Sahel countries if the Tuaregs, who formed part of Gaddafi’s army of mercenaries, returned. They said that those armed Tuaregs would unite, in particular, with their supporters in those countries and also with forces of the al-Qaeda organisation in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM); they also warned that AQIM had infiltrated the Libyan rebels. Baroness Ashton, I am very pleased about the measures you announced for all the Sahel countries, but I would just say that those measures need to be taken urgently and quickly because otherwise, we are going to be facing a truly pressing problem. Most of those countries could soon come under the control of the fundamentalist AQIM forces, all of which will be happening on Europe’s doorstep. I should not like to finish without mentioning all those people who have been abducted by AQIM, and I urge you to take all possible measures to bring about their swift liberation.

 Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Ms Vassiliou, my colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education and the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for the fruitful work we have done together over the past few months. Today the sports world is mourning those who died at a football match in Egypt. I would like to express my strong condemnation, and to remember the victims and their families. While drawing up this report I was in constant contact with the sports world, hearing people’s concerns and trying to reflect the issues on which the EU is being asked to express its opinion. The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has caused a revolution in the sports world because, for the first time, it was given its own legal basis, in Article 165. The first response to the Treaty was the Commission communication entitled ‘Developing the European Dimension in Sport’, which follows the guidelines set out in the 2007 White Paper. Parliament responded with an own-initiative report of the same name. The report was approved by the Committee on Culture and Education by 28 votes in favour and 2 votes against. I would like to highlight two concepts related to sport, of which I was very aware when writing the report. Firstly, the principle of subsidiarity, which recognises the competences of Member States and, secondly, the concept of the specific nature of sport, as mentioned in Article 165. However, this is not a universal principle, but rather one that must be analysed and approved on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the autonomy of governance structures in sport should be respected as a fundamental principle for its organisation. Allow me to briefly highlight some points made in the report. First of all, volunteering, when thousands of citizens selflessly take part to ensure that countless sporting events can be held. We must give them our unconditional support. Secondly, doping. Doping substances are a blight on sport and society. We should educate people on prevention, convict traffickers, pursue cheats and harmonise sanctions between sports law and civil law, maintaining the greatest possible respect for sportspeople. The report urges Member States to treat trafficking in illegal substances in the same way as trafficking in illegal drugs and to adopt national legislation to this end. It is vital to support the practice of sport in schools, and we therefore call for sport to be part of their curriculum. At some point, sportspeople’s professional careers come to an end, and during their career they need to have access to high-quality academic training in order to later become integrated into the world of work. Unfortunately, racism, xenophobia and homophobia are present in sport, and it is therefore necessary to implement new measures to eliminate any signs of those threats at sporting events. I would like to stress the undeniable benefit that sport has on people’s health, leading to a significant reduction in public health spending. I would also highlight the importance of sport as a means of integration for the most vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and socially excluded groups, as well as for those with disabilities. Betting should be protected from unauthorised activities, and from suspected match fixing, in particular by recognising organisers’ property rights with regard to their competitions. The report also calls on Member States to take legal action against sports fraud. It is fundamentally important that commercial exploitation of audiovisual rights for sport competitions should be carried out on a centralised, territorial basis with a view to guaranteeing that revenues are distributed fairly between elite and mass-participation sport. I would like to draw attention to the proposal to establish a European Day of Sports and an Erasmus Sports Programme, and to protect indigenous sports as part of our cultural heritage. These are just a few of the issues dealt with in the report, and I hope I can count on Parliament’s support. Santiago Fisas Ayxela,  
rapporteur. – (ES) 
Mr President, I should like to thank all the Members who have spoken in this sitting. I am not going to waste a second refuting some of the lies that have been told today. Whoever is able to read should simply read the report. I would, however, like to finish by stressing the importance of sport for a variety of vital social issues such as the integration of the most vulnerable groups, public health, education, employment and the economy. We should remember that sport in Europe represents, whether directly or indirectly, 15 million jobs – that is, 5.4% of the active population – and an annual added value of EUR 407 billion, which is 3.65% of European GDP. For this reason, because sport is so important, I welcome the Commission’s initiative and support, and I would also venture to ask the Commissioner whether Structural Funds could be applied specifically to sport. Above all, I would like to thank the main political groups in this House for their support. Thanks to the support shown by those groups, I hope that this report will be adopted in tomorrow’s vote.

 Madam President, fortunately the Libyan opposition has successfully confronted Muammar Gaddafi’s dictatorship, with the help of the international community. Now Gaddafi must be caught and judged for the crimes, violations of human rights, and possible crimes against humanity that he may have committed. The most important thing of all at the moment is to focus our efforts on rebuilding the country and endeavour to help Libya become a democratic state based on the rule of law. There are certain vital elements for ensuring the country is secure and viable: establishing the normal functioning of infrastructures, particularly where water, electricity and oil are concerned; maintaining public order by means of a police force; and effectively collecting all the weapons that have been distributed throughout the country. We should also remember the importance of supporting the Sahel countries: on the one hand, to avoid the extremely serious consequences for their security if mercenaries return and pro-Gaddafi forces flee to those countries; on the other hand, to support their institutions, which are enabling displaced persons from Libya to make an orderly return to their homes. Finally, I believe that the deployment of a United Nations mission to the country would be key to achieving the objectives mentioned. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE
).

Madam President, Lady Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to refer to the case of Libya in particular. Among all the Maghreb countries, the situation of Libya seems to me especially worrying since it is at the gates of Europe and has abundant oil reserves. We have been at war a long time and the situation appears to be stagnating. I believe that the EU should do everything possible to achieve two objectives: that Colonel Gaddafi leaves the country and, also, that Libya enjoys a stable situation and becomes a democratic state, and does not run the risk of degenerating into a failed state which could be infiltrated by al-Qaeda, which would be a very dangerous and worrying situation for Europe. Furthermore, an ungovernable state, the massive return of emigrants to their countries of origin and, above all, of armed Tuaregs, could cause a conflict situation in the neighbouring countries. Libya is an Arab state but, above all, it is an African state, and I think it is very important to take into account the opinion of the neighbouring states of the Sahel in connection with this country’s situation. If we are not capable of getting rid of Gaddafi and bringing this war to an end, maybe these countries have proposals that we should listen to. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

Mr President, as you know, Niger, one of the central countries of the Sahel region, is holding presidential and parliamentary elections at the end of this month. I think that Baroness Ashton’s decision to send a European Union delegation to those elections is an important gesture of support, and I want to thank her for thinking of me to chair it. I would first of all like to express my regret at the recent murder of two young French people in Niger at the hands of terrorists, not forgetting the Nigerien soldiers who died during the rescue operation. The population of the region clearly rejects violence and terrorism, as they are the first to suffer as a result, but they ask the European Union to do everything it can to help them to eradicate terrorist violence and, among other things, to provide weapons and training for their armed forces so that they can respond adequately to these terrorist incursions. In addition, despite having a great wealth of natural resources, Niger is one of the least developed countries in the world. The European Union must therefore work to establish an effective development cooperation strategy to help Niger and the whole region out of the difficult situation they are in. I think there is a great deal at stake for us in this area of the world, because it is not only its welfare, but that of Europe that is dependent on its stability, given its geographical proximity.

Madam President, thousands of Saharans left their cities and peacefully set up the Gdaim Izyk camp in order to demand better living conditions. The Moroccan security forces violently dismantled the camp and, as a result, serious riots broke out in Al Aaiún. The Moroccan armed forces killed a young Saharan, and a Spanish citizen died in unclear circumstances. There are currently no reliable figures regarding the number of deaths, injuries, disappearances or arrests during those riots. Moreover, numerous MEPs have been banned from entering the Sahara, along with journalists who are still having serious problems doing their work. Morocco is Europe’s friend and strategic ally, and it is not good to have doubts or misunderstandings between friends. If Morocco has nothing to hide, it must allow the clarification of what happened. Therefore, although it is true that the Moroccan Parliament has set up an investigative commission, I think it is essential that an international commission be set up, that European and politicians and journalists have freedom of access to the area and that the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara extend its mandate to the protection of human rights, both in the area controlled by Morocco and in the area controlled by Polisario. The Commission and the European governments, least of all the Spanish Government, cannot look the other way in response to this situation. Realpolitik
 must not be an excuse for turning a blind eye. They must request clarification regarding these serious events and ask Morocco and the Polisario to resume discussions as soon as possible in order to arrive at a peaceful agreement on the basis of the United Nations resolutions.

 Madam President, Judge Afiuni granted parole to Eligio Cedeño, in accordance with Venezuelan law and in line with the opinion of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions. This led to her incarceration in a maximum-security prison, in conditions that are putting her life in danger. President Chávez has publicly requested that the prosecutor seek the maximum penalty, and that the National Assembly pass a law to increase her sentence with retroactive effect. Amnesty International and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have indicated their great concern. This is not an isolated case, ladies and gentlemen. On the contrary, it demonstrates the autocratic and authoritarian drift of a regime that, alongside seemingly democratic elections, closes opposing media, orders confiscations and arrests political opponents, showing no respect for human rights and the rule of law. We have therefore requested that Judge Afiuni be freed immediately. Santiago Fisas Ayxela  (PPE

 Mr President, the Sagrada Familia, 
the work of the brilliant, Catalonian architect, Antoni Gaudí, is a genuine icon of Barcelona throughout the world. It was declared to be a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) in 2005. Work is currently being done on the high-speed train that will cross the city by means of a tunnel that lies a mere four metres from the foundations of the Sagrada Familia. There are 38 technical reports opposing these works. The International Council on Monuments and Sites, a specialist Unesco body, has expressed its concern about the route. Moreover, the lower house of the Spanish Parliament adopted a motion on 22 June to ask for a precautionary suspension of the works and the setting up of a committee of experts that could propose another solution within a time limit of two months. I would like to ask what measures the Commission is going to take to preserve a building as emblematic as is Barcelona’s Sagrada Familia against the risk represented by the passing of the high-speed train?

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against poverty and the other Millennium Development Goals should unite us all. I therefore regret the fact that some political groups have introduced certain issues that might make it difficult to achieve that unanimity. They are moral issues, such as proposing abortion as a method of birth control, or economic issues, such as introducing a tax on currency transactions. I think that this tax would be very difficult to implement, control and collect, and if it were not adopted across the board, especially in the main financial blocks, transactions would be moved to the countries where it was not in force. I regret that the report, which contains many positive points, will not receive unanimous support from all the political groups because of these particular issues. Santiago Fisas Ayxela,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mexico has a major problem with drugs trafficking and drug-related violence. To address this situation, the Government of President Felipe Calderón has adopted a tough stance in order to achieve its eradication: he has taken the decision to temporarily mobilise the armed forces, a move which has had a significant impact on the number of people arrested, the destruction of drugs and the confiscation of weapons. The army has accepted all the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission, including those concerning the investigation of complaints about their own conduct. The Government also recognises that it needs to make substantial changes in the area of security and justice, and is implementing an ambitious reform of the justice system in order for it to be more transparent and to bring to justice those who commit crimes, while respecting human rights. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wishes to show its solidarity with the Mexican people in the fight against drugs trafficking, and we support President Calderón in his willingness to combat organised crime. Finally, I would like to express my satisfaction with this agreement, which unites the main political Groups of this Parliament. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,

 Mr President, today is a very important day for all victims, particularly victims of terrorism, because on 11 September 2001, more than 3 000 innocent people died in several terrorist attacks in the United States. We cannot forget those who died in London and Madrid, or the many victims of terrorism in Europe, such as those of the ETA terrorist organisation in Spain, my country. Society as a whole is the victim in a terrorist attack, but a few citizens pay with their lives to defend our freedom. That is why, Mr President, I am dedicating part of my speaking time, including the time I have been allocated at the end of the debate, to observe one minute’s silence for all of these victims. (The House observed a minute’s silence)
 I should like to thank Commissioner Reding for the sensitivity she has shown towards victims, also the Council for its flexibility, and Ms Parvanova for her excellent work, as well as the Members of Parliament who have followed this report. Tomorrow will be crucial not only for victims but for all citizens, and believe me when I say that anyone can become a victim, as we can see from this compelling statistic: 75 million people a year are victims of crime in Europe. I believe it is time to give the victims the place they deserve, that is, at the centre of our debates in Parliament, because, even though the economic situation is our main concern today, I know that in most European countries, people are extremely worried about the way the justice system functions. This directive, which sends a clear message to victims that their rights will not be ignored and that they will be treated with respect and dignity, will serve to build people’s confidence in justice. The response to victims’ call for justice begins in Europe: a transparent and effective framework that restores citizens’ rights and the hope they have lost, in some cases, in their judicial system. Irrespective of their nationality or the place where the crime was committed, the victims will have the right to be informed, to understand and be understood, to legal counsel, and to be heard and protected. Victim support services will be able to provide psychological support and defend the victims at all times. I have heard many victims’ accounts, all of which were very traumatic, but necessary in order to understand the needs of the different types of victims; I would like to add that I dedicate this directive to them, especially to my brother, Alberto, and his wife, who will be looking down on me from heaven. In Parliament today, we are taking an important first step towards helping a father who has lost his son in another country, the victim of an attack, or a girl who has been raped and has no idea where to begin or what to tell the police. They are forced to go through that nightmare, and we are helping all of them here today. I hope this compass guides not only victims when they are crossing the desert of criminal proceedings, but also all those who must support them on their path of pain, such as judges, police officers and legal experts, including in cases involving children, and I also dedicate this directive to them. Today is a very important day for all victims: victims of gender violence, people trafficking, terrorism, organised crime, as well as child victims, victims with disabilities, and all those who have experienced the ordeal of a crime. Unfortunately, we cannot bring back people’s loved ones, nor can we restore their honour, the peace of mind they have lost, or their health, but all of us here today can promise them that we shall continue working towards giving them back their rights, dignity and belief in justice. I am committing myself and I call on the whole of Parliament to do the same with me tomorrow. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur. 
– (ES) 
Mr President, I should like once more to thank all those who have made it possible for this directive to become a reality: the secretariat, the Commission, the rapporteur, all those I am forgetting to mention and all my fellow Members who have supported us. I should like to say to every single victim without exception that, for us, they and their families have faces, names and are real people, and it is specifically on their behalf that we will work to ensure this directive is truly effective and – with the commitment and support of Commissioner Reding, of which I have no doubt whatsoever – is quickly and efficiently implemented, which is what all of us, and all citizens, want. I think there are various victims’ associations that would have wanted, and continue to want, their own directive, but I will make sure they know that the directive we shall vote on tomorrow does not overlook a single victim and, therefore, does not overlook them either. I am certain that this is the first important step and that it will be followed by many other steps that will open the doors of justice, which have been closed to victims for too long. When I am asked, as I often am in my country, what I do in Europe, I will be able to say with great pride that I am legislating in support of victims. That work is a great honour to me personally, and it motivates me to continue working. I am sure that, with the support and commitment of all those who are not only working here in the EU but also in our own countries, as well as your support, ladies and gentlemen, together we will succeed in putting an end to the situation of unjust neglect in which victims find themselves.

 Madam President, I have been denouncing female genital mutilation since I became a Member of Parliament. This silent and accepted crime is suffered by millions of women and girls throughout the world: 70 million, I repeat, 70 million. An unbearable figure for those who stop to examine the terrible consequences of these practices, hidden under the guises of psychological, health, and religious reasons, all of which are false. The truth is that circumcision, preferentially practised on 14-year-old girls, and even those aged one year old, can lead to death by haemorrhagic shock and, at best, cause and bring about strong psychological consequences from the trauma. We should strive with all our efforts in Europe to eradicate this violation of human rights, which infringes on the right to equal opportunities and puts health at risk. It is, ladies and gentlemen, abuse, cruelty and torture against girls, and this degrading treatment also occurs in Europe. We must therefore activate all the available prevention mechanisms in our legal system and encourage our judges to act to prevent the genital mutilation of girls in Europe, punishing those who carry it out. EU law has to speak with a single voice to combat the mutilation on our soil. Lastly, I call on civil society and NGOs to become actively involved in education and prevention campaigns. There is still a long way to go, but we are a large group who will not give up, as we owe it to the 70 million mutilated women. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 Madam President, from the European Parliament I wish to pay tribute to all women today because, despite the fact that we have made much progress since March 1911, when women took to the streets to demand the vote and better working conditions, I think that women’s equality is still a long way away. Today women can work without having to get permission from anyone but, in many cases, they continue to earn less than men for similar work, which is unacceptable. We must also remember women in rural areas, whose work goes unnoticed. I think that another uncomfortable truth, but one which we must continue to denounce, is violence against women. This year alone an excessive number of women have already been murdered, leaving aside serious threats from those who believe they have the right to perpetrate physical or psychological violence against women. It is time to say enough and to say it loud and clear. From this Parliament I reiterate my commitment to the European protection order for victims and to the Directive on the rights of victims which the Commission put forward and which will be voted upon next June, God willing. It also has to be said, and I should like to remind people, that motherhood is still an obstacle to the progression of women and I think this is a trend that should be changed. I want to send a message of hope: many women, with the help of more and more men, need to advance along the path of equal opportunities, rights and responsibilities. We have come a long way but there is a lot left to do. I have to admit that I do not believe in quotas in any way, shape or form but I must say that something has to be done and I agree with many of you and, of course, with Ms Reding, in opening this debate and advancing along that path so that women regain the place that they deserve and to that end you can count on my support. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,

 Madam President, I am pleased to know that the European protection order will be put to the vote and, in all probability, ratified by a large majority in this Chamber tomorrow. I say that from the heart as, since I entered this Parliament, I have been loyal in my commitment to the victims in defence of their rights, and one of the basic rights of any victim is to be suitably protected. My commitment extends to all citizens, as we are all potential victims of crime and we have the need to be able to live in a world and a European area of freedom, justice and security. With your votes in favour, we will be legislating to make life easier for the victims, who will feel equally protected in any country of the European Union going forward, without the need to initiate a new legal procedure with every move. In summary, we will make it easier for the victims to move around and we will limit their aggressors’ movements, which I consider to be a big step forward that I am delighted to have been able to make as the rapporteur for this report. The time is already upon us to stop allowing crime to cross borders, placing our lives at risk. We have the right and duty to protect ourselves, and this tool will serve that purpose. Despite the difficulties and the path we have taken during these two years of negotiations, which has not always been smooth, I want to thank the Polish Presidency today for having skilfully driven the negotiations. I also want to thank the Commission which, thanks to the vision of Ms Reding on presenting the legislative package relative to the victims and an additional regulation in civil law, has finally managed to dispel the Council’s doubts about the convenience of supporting the European protection order, along with opening the door to more wide-ranging legislation for the rights of the victims of crime and their support, on which I am working with a great deal of hope. I want to thank my co-rapporteur, Ms Romero, and also the Secretariat. When we return to our countries and people ask us ‘What do you do over there in Europe?’, given that they view our work as so distant and incomprehensible, this time I will be able to tell them that we have at least created an instrument, which we have ratified in this parliamentary session, which will protect so many people that suffer violence. I offer this future law for the many women killed through male violence, the many innocent people that suffer human trafficking without the possibility of escaping from their aggressors, the many defenceless children, the victims of terrorism that live with their terror, those that run from organised crime, and the many that don’t know where to go for fear of being pursued. We have taken a big step today towards the defence and protection of those that are most in need. I would like to conclude my speech with three words that are the guiding light in my work and life: freedom, justice and dignity. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, I think it is very important to closely follow the application of the European protection order. We refer to filing a report, but these reports should be followed by real protection. We need troops: we can approve good laws, but if we do not provide countries with the necessary means, the victims will not feel confident and they will continue to keep quiet for fear of being assaulted again. Therefore, it is necessary that the judges and the police have the training and means to be able to do their job properly. That is real justice. So many victims complain about the application of a law that does not meet their needs. It is necessary, therefore, that we pool our efforts, that we insist on the statistics to see how this instrument is working, which I believe is really necessary. I ask the Member States to make the effort to understand and apply this regulation, as that’s what we have worked for, and we consider that we have made it clear. I think that from now on, the doors to victim rights are wide open in Europe, that women and men can count on this, and other instruments, which will make victims come forward and put a stop to those that they fear. Today through our voices, and tomorrow through our votes, we will tell the victims that we will never forget their rights in the European Parliament, the support that society owes them, and mostly importantly, justice. I can tell you that it is justice that keeps all the victims alive, regardless of the crime committed against them. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 Madam President, as rapporteur of the report on the drafting of a directive on the rights of victims of crimes, including terrorism, and as a Spaniard who has personally suffered the cruelty of the terrorist organisation ETA, I would like to thank President Buzek for his support for my country and its victims. I understand the pleasure that many people feel at this new statement from ETA, but I must remind you that it is still too soon to celebrate, because they have not yet handed over their weapons, nor disbanded, nor asked their victims for forgiveness. Ladies and gentlemen, it is also important for you to realise that we do not have to reach any kind of peace between the two sides in Spain, because there has not been a war. My brother, Alberto Jiménez-Becerril, who was murdered by ETA along with his wife in Seville, was not returning from war. He was going home, where his three children, who would never see him again, were waiting for him. We have the obligation to tell my brother’s children that his parents were better than their murderers. If we accept an end without winners or losers, we will be showing these children that you can achieve political objectives by killing. So I ask Parliament not to allow itself to be hoodwinked by the ETA terrorists and their accomplices, and to listen to the sincere voices of the victims. The only thing they want is the peace that comes from justice. (Applause) Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I would like to say to everyone that there is only one kind of terrorism, simply that which destroys innocent lives. Where it comes from is not an issue. The victims of terrorism, whom I represent, given that the ETA terrorist organisation killed my brother and his wife, share a common thread, and on their behalf, I would like to say that this report, with such a long title, could have been ambitious, but it is not. It is a disappointing outcome. This report does not represent us, it does not represent hopes for justice, or the balance between freedom and security that we talk about so much here. It does not represent us, and I believe that a report on terrorism should acknowledge the victims of terrorism, but this does not. Therefore, I ask you to vote against this report.

 Mr President, in defence of fundamental rights, I call on the responsible institutions to review the designation of San Sebastián as European Capital of Culture, because I believe that it was chosen on the basis of political criteria, which constitutes discrimination against the other candidate cities. The chairman of the panel said the city was chosen to support the peace process but, as far as I am aware, there is a terrorist organisation in Spain, called ETA, that so far has not laid down its weapons and which two months ago managed to get its political wing, Bildu, into government in San Sebastián, as well as other towns. I do not believe that Europe should be giving such a powerful megaphone to people who fail to condemn terrorist violence and who will create propaganda out of apportioning blame between victims and murderers. Where is the right to freedom and dignity? Clearly not in San Sebastián, where our fellow Members such as Mayor Oreja, Mr Iturgaiz, Mr Zalba, and I myself have to go around with bodyguards. I believe in the culture of life, not in a bullet to the back of the head. Ladies and gentlemen, can there be any true culture without freedom? No, a thousand times no. San Sebastián should once again submit its candidacy when it is a city that is free for everyone. In the meantime, they should learn the culture of respect towards those who think differently, because although the city may deserve the title in future, today, with Batasuna and its successors in its institutions, it does not.

Mr President, the most important thing, and that which is uniting us here today, are the victims, because nobody should feel as unprotected as we, the European consumers, feel at the moment. Furthermore, we need clarity and responsibility in respect of the victims. It is my responsibility to denounce the German authorities, who, wrongly and hastily, accused Spanish cucumbers and, more specifically, the cooperatives of Malaga and Almeria, which were model operations and which will not recover from these accusations. Thousands of jobless families are wondering why – and they need an answer – and, in particular, they want to know what the future holds for them, not just in Andalusia, but throughout European agriculture. Therefore, and in the hope that the experts will soon find the solution, I demand that today, when the Commission speaks to the Council, it asks for immediate and moral economic measures for all the producers from Andalusia and from the whole of Europe, who are looking towards us with indignation, but also with hope. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,

 Mr President, on most occasions that I have spoken in Parliament, it has been to denounce violence against women, and I am here again to combat it. I must say that not only do I not tire of doing this, but I think that it is essential to continue to speak out in public about this violation of human rights, as you cannot defend a cause without a sounding board. Furthermore, this Parliament is the best loudspeaker available to me to defend all those women who suffer daily from abuse and who need us, as legislators, to compel the Member States to punish the perpetrators of this aggression in a manner that befits the seriousness of the crime, and also to provide assistance to the victims. When, according to estimates, one in four women in Europe has suffered gender violence at least once in her life, and the same proportion of children, I believe that we cannot but demand greater commitment, as has been recognised by the Commission in its action plan. I believe that we must keep on insisting, time and time again, in order to protect victims, as we did with the European Protection Order, for which I was rapporteur, and I hope that it will come into effect as soon as possible. This report has benefited from a great measure of consensus and support from the outset. This shows that when we tackle domestic violence, which affects all family members, including children, the elderly, women and men, this should not provide the opportunity for political opportunism, as it does us all great credit to be making progress towards finding a solution to this scourge of our society. The first thing we must do is to speak up, and the second is to get down to work, for, although we have spent decades speaking about gender violence, we have not managed to reduce the number of deaths. We must be doing something wrong, and therefore, it is time to leave demagogy aside and to move from words to actions. We must give more genuine assistance and apply the legislation that women need if they are to live in dignity and safety. I want all the victims to know that I shall always be here to speak up for them, until the day that, by working together, we manage to defeat this terrible enemy, which sadly ends the lives of so many innocent victims. What I say is: we have had enough. It cannot go on. I ask all of you to say likewise. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Madam President, today is a very significant day to talk about equality between men and women because we are celebrating International Women’s Day, remembering those who fought for women’s working and economic rights and their right to vote 100 years ago. We have made considerable progress in those 100 years, but much remains to be done. True equality is still a dream and discrimination against women is a fact of life. I believe that every one of us, both men and women, can do a lot more to achieve true emancipation for women. There are many women in the world whose right to life is being threatened, whose dignity is being violated, and whose freedom is being denied. Allow me, on this International Women’s Day, to demonstrate my support and hope to all women fighting for their democratic rights in the revolution in North Africa. Women cannot be worth half what men are in Arab counties or anywhere in the world. We are worth the same and deserve the same. I will continue fighting to achieve that equality and International Women’s Day will continue to exist until it is achieved. Even if there are many who do not want to see it, the reality is that there are women who earn half of what men do and that domestic violence mainly affects women and children. I must repeat that these facts must continue to be reported in Parliament, and I promise to continue working toward that, of course. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Mr President, while not wishing to take the comparison between terrorism and immigration too far, I have observed that unfortunately, EU action is driven by emergency situations, such as a serious attack or a mass landing of immigrants, as is currently happening in Lampedusa, where the exodus of Tunisians to the Italian coast could culminate in a chronicle of a death foretold. The voyage of hope could end up becoming a cursed voyage, and it will be on the consciences of all of us who witness these continuous uncontrolled influxes and do not say ‘enough is enough’ with sufficient authority. When it happens, we will throw up our hands in horror, but the following day we will forget about it. Europeans have a duty and a right to know the truth: that the Mediterranean strategy is not working, that the common immigration policy will continue to be a dream until European countries commit to equipping the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) with sufficient resources to be effective. Talking does not cost anything, but we need to act. Do you really believe that Frontex is currently able to guarantee the security of the European borders? I do not believe it is. Let us hope that the people of Egypt, Tunisia and other countries of the Maghreb do not decide en masse
 to seek a better future in Europe, but rather that they do so in their own countries, because that is what they have fought for, and we must help them. Solidarity and responsibility are therefore required, along with, above all, truth when talking about a common European immigration policy, which is now more necessary than ever. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, today is an important day for all victims, because today we shall adopt the European Protection Order, which is a significant step forward in terms of their rights. Victims are unfairly forgotten about, and it is paradoxical that aggressors often have many more rights and that there is more said about aggressors’ rights than victims’ rights. Today, Parliament will honour all victims, reminding those who believe that the borders will shield them while they persecute their victims, that this European Protection Order will protect all victims equally in the European Union from this day onwards. We started working more than a year ago to achieve this objective and make progress with the area of freedom and security that was mentioned in the Stockholm Programme, and today we can say with a degree of pride that, although the path has not been easy, as many people have frequently failed to understand the order, and doubted its effectiveness and clarity, we have achieved it. I must say that, following the trialogues with the Belgian Presidency, and many conversations with the Commission, we have achieved a text that almost all the political groups were happy with. This report was therefore adopted by a huge majority with no votes against in the joint vote by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. I hope that today, Parliament will reflect the decision made by those committees and by those of us who produced this report, which was adopted by a huge majority. This would send a clear message to the Council about what Europeans want, which is nothing more than to live in an area of security and justice, to be protected, and for a victim who has a restraining order against her aggressor in her country not to have to begin further court proceedings when she moves to another country. We have an obligation to facilitate access to justice for Europeans, and especially for victims, who are the most vulnerable. The protection of all victims, without exception, has been my beacon throughout the development of this report. I therefore wanted to include victims of terrorism, people trafficking, organised crime and honour crimes, along with a special chapter for minors, who are the most vulnerable victims, and we never think about how to protect them. Although this order will protect all victims, women who suffer from domestic violence will benefit most from this instrument for judicial cooperation, as their aggressors will not be able to travel through Europe with impunity, and will know that they will be pursued in the same way as in the country where they attacked their partners. Parliament must therefore send a clear message to the Council today about what we want. We will therefore vote with our eyes fixed on the victims, on those who suffer, on those who need us to protect them, on those who are afraid and need to live in freedom and hope. We are not going to give up on such a fair and necessary aim that is supported by the majority of Europeans just because there are some who are afraid and never dare to take that one step further. We need to be brave, the Member States need to be brave, and I hope that the vote today will be a majority in favour and encourage those who still have doubts as to whether this instrument will open a door for victims. I also hope that in the near future, the Commission will put forward wide-ranging legislation in favour of victims’ rights, for which it has my full support and, I am sure, Parliament’s support. I repeat: this small but major step that is the European Protection Order will improve protection for all victims, preventing further crimes and relieving the consequences of those that have already been committed. Today, we have an obligation to remove the obstacles that have so far prevented real protection across Europe. Through our vote today, we have the opportunity to save lives, which is what we are going to do, and we should be genuinely proud of that. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,  
rapporteur.
 – (ES) 
Madam President, I think that in this debate, we have clearly seen that we are all in agreement in supporting the objective of this report. The various political groups have shown their support for this directive, which offers greater protection to victims. My question is, therefore: what obstacles are there to adopting this instrument? I repeat: what fears are there regarding something as essential and simple as protecting victims equally across Europe finally becoming a reality? In the hope that Parliament will adopt this report by a majority, I would like to address the Council and the Commission to remind them that we have overcome the legal hurdles in our negotiations, and I welcome the fact that the Commission acknowledges our work, just as we acknowledge the work that it will do in the future. We should not therefore exclude ourselves, but rather help ourselves by adopting this more specific instrument today, and tomorrow by adopting the broader package of measures to help victims that will be presented by the Commission, with which I promise to cooperate. Let us therefore be brave and responsible, and let us help all those who have the right to live in a safer Europe. I repeat: let us help everyone, be they men, women or children. Let us help those who are looking to us today to give them a better life, a life that will restore to them their freedom, their security and, above all, their dignity.

Mr President, I have asked for the floor to remind you of the importance of today’s vote in order to send a clear message to the Council, aimed at the countries that have still not equipped themselves with security in this field. I believe that today, we have an opportunity to defend victims and ensure that they can live without fear and in freedom. It is very important, not only for women, but also for men, children, victims of terrorism, victims of organised crime, victims of trafficking of women and for victims in general.

Mr President, last month, I organised a hearing in this Parliament concerning the victims of terrorism, which was attended by the President of Parliament and various Members of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). The victims have turned to us, as their representatives in Europe, to guarantee them their right to justice which has been trampled on so many times in their own countries, such as Spain, where the Rodríguez Zapatero Government continues to lie to the Spanish people about a negotiation process with a terrorist group which has still not relinquished its arms. It is because of this that such grave incidents as the Bar Faisán
 tip off, in which the terrorists were warned of the operation in progress to arrest them, have still not been thoroughly investigated. Democratic governments cannot turn their backs on the victims of terrorism; they have already paid the highest price in the fight for liberty. Parliament must push for a European Charter which recognises the legitimate demands of the victims, such as not negotiating with terrorists and ensuring that they serve their prison sentences in full.

Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Human Rights, as a Spanish and European citizen, and as a victim of terrorism since the terrorist organisation ETA murdered my brother and his wife in Seville, I am speaking here today to condemn the fact that the Venezuelan Government and its President has allowed ETA terrorists to train on Venezuelan soil on the orders of the alleged terrorist, Arturo Cubillas, who works for Hugo Chávez’s government despite the fact that there is an international warrant out for his arrest; this is a serious violation of the fundamental right to all European citizens’ right to security. I demand firm action from the Spanish Government in response to this serious humiliation of all the Spanish people. Mr Zapatero cannot continue to keep quiet while the Venezuelan Ambassador describes the members of our Civil Guard, who have been, and will continue to be, models of bravery in the fight against ETA, as torturers. Nor can he look the other way as cooperation on Venezuelan soil between ETA and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia grows, which has already been condemned by the Judge Eloy Velasco. Mr Zapatero cannot shake the hand of a leader such as Mr Chávez, who is turning Venezuela into a haven for terrorists. The Prime Minister of a country such as Spain, where terrorism has caused so much pain, cannot continue to ignore this problem and should give the response that such a situation deserves, which is what any ordinary citizen would do if they had the opportunity.

 Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity in this House today, as I was unable to do so on the ‘European Day for the Victims of Terrorism’ on 11 March, to pay a well-deserved tribute to these victims in recognition of the enormous sacrifice made by those who have paid the ultimate price in the name of freedom. We urgently need to start to work on a directive to protect the rights of the victims of terrorism, who are always the ones who are overlooked and who suffer the humiliation of being unjustly equated with their murderers. It is high time that we within these European institutions recognise the dignity of the victims of terrorism, and help to defend their right to protection and justice. This right should soon be embodied in a law that honours all those who make this possible, whose first article should state that support to victims of terrorism entails recognition of their right to justice and that no government should ever pay a price for this. I call on all those in a position to defend the victims never to forget that true peace is a peace born of justice, and that is the only peace that those of us who believe in freedom and democracy in Europe and anywhere else in the world should defend. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to say that I did not come to Parliament to applaud the brand new law in Spain on abortion. What I am concerned about is human life, and I am particularly concerned about the women – who I am here to defend – whose lives are in danger as a result of gender violence, and I am here to offer them a space in which they can live freely and safely. Parliament’s Resolution of 2 February 2006 recommended that the Member States adopt an attitude of zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women, and that they adopt the necessary measures to ensure better protection for victims. The Stockholm Programme, which was adopted in this House, established an area of freedom, justice and security for all European citizens, and combating gender violence was considered to be a priority in that programme. This reflected my request for the Spanish Presidency to promote a European protection order for the victims of gender violence during its mandate, to ensure that the victims of these crimes have the same level of protection in all the Member States. In a Europe without borders, the fight against gender violence should also be without borders, and the Member States should work hard to harmonise their legislation so that the fight against ill-treatment of women overcomes the legislative obstacles in its way and we can finally protect the lives of women and their children, at least within the European Union, I therefore ask the Commission and the Council to do everything that is necessary and everything in their power to move forward with the European protection order for victims, which is a very effective instrument for ensuring that those who fail to respect the dignity of women and their right to live freely and safely do not go unpunished. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

Mr President, when dealing with a topic as serious as terrorism, we should not wait for things to happen before we act. We should anticipate events, but we do not. Unfortunately, we only change in response to each attack, such as the failed attack in Detroit, which is forcing us today to take decisions to ensure the safety of air transport. Taking a decision on body scanners in airports is a responsibility that we cannot avoid, ladies and gentlemen. We cannot wait any longer because the terrorists are not waiting. Consequently, the Commission must guarantee, as soon as possible, that the dignity and privacy of individuals will be preserved and that there will be no harmful effects on health. Once this is guaranteed, we must adopt decisions for the European Union as a whole. To those who are worried about infringement of our fundamental rights, I say that there is no greater right than the right to life, and those of us who cherish freedom above all else must be able to live safely in order to feel truly free. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE

 According to a United Nations report, in 2009, some 270 000 people were victims of human trafficking within the European Union. With these figures in mind, we need to ensure that European Union action is based, first and foremost, on victim protection, with special focus on the situation of women and children, who are the most vulnerable. We cannot continue to stand by and remain indifferent to the play that is being enacted, to the sideshow of sexual exploitation that is unfolding before our eyes. For this reason, I completely support the Parliament’s demands that victim assistance should be unconditional and that more forceful methods and more severe penalties should be adopted, as Mr Barrot has just told us. Having said that, I would like to call on the Spanish Presidency, the European Commission and the Council to use all the European legislation at their disposal, both existing and future legislation, to protect the victims of human trafficking. I consider that the proposed European victim protection system, which I personally demanded from the Spanish Presidency during the Stockholm Programme debates, and which has finally come to fruition, will be an effective instrument for fighting such crimes. I hope for a firm undertaking, as we have already seen, from the Spanish Presidency, to ensure that this system offers victims special protective measures that will be effective throughout the European Union. I hope that we who are responsible for taking action against the most severe problems in our society will come up with a real and substantial response to this extremely severe problem of human trafficking and that our words will not be empty promises. We really owe it to all the victims. Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio,

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to say that the majority of governments and citizens only remember the victims of terrorism after a serious attack such as the ones in Madrid, New York or London. Once the wave of emotion has passed, they tend to forget about the terrorist threat and the rights of victims. Today, however, there is no doubt about the European Union’s commitment to the fight against terrorism. As Commissioner Barrot has just told us, this commitment has also been reflected in the recently adopted Stockholm Programme, which recognises the courage and dignity of the victims and the need to defend their rights. Despite this progress, the fight against terrorism has always been based on trust and mutual cooperation between the Member States. Taking into account the perspective offered by the Treaty of Lisbon, I wonder whether it would be a good idea for the European Union to promote harmonisation of the legislation of the Member States on the rights of victims of terrorism. The adoption of a European charter of the rights of victims of terrorism would be a big step forward that would help those fighting terrorism and would be a strong blow for those that defend it. It is the courage and dignity of the victims that is the greatest failure of terrorism and therefore the greatest triumph of democracy. We should never forget that the only weapon that innocent victims have against terrorism is their word and the recognition of society. Therefore, you should also not forget, ladies and gentlemen, that none of us are safe from being victims of terrorism. My question is, therefore: would the Commission agree with adopting a European charter to recognise the defence of the rights of the victims of terrorism and to promote those rights? If so, what measures would the new Commission take to drive forward this Charter under its new mandate? Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio  (PPE
). 
 – (ES) 
Mr President, today there is no doubt about the European Union’s commitment to the fight against terrorism, and thanks to the Stockholm Programme, we will continue to make progress on this essential area of freedom, security and justice. In my view, this fight has been based on mutual trust between the Member States, but now, with the possibilities opened up by the Treaty of Lisbon, it is high time to harmonise national legislation so that there is no time limit on prosecuting terrorist crimes, which should be considered as crimes against humanity. When this happens, nobody in this Parliament or in any other will defend terrorists, as has happened, is happening and may continue to happen, to the detriment of victims of terrorism, who watch those who murdered their loved ones being treated like heroes, while they suffer in silence. I therefore ask Parliament to drive forward or adopt a European charter for the rights of the victims of terrorism, based on defending the memory… (The President cut off the speaker) Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to congratulate you as the Commission’s proposal on the employment package is very important. It is an ambitious and difficult challenge in the context of the current crisis, but we have to achieve the objective of the Europe 2020 strategy and create new jobs. To achieve this objective, the job markets need to be reformed so that they are more dynamic and inclusive, with workers trained in appropriate skills so they are more resistant to economic adjustment processes, and make full use of their potential for job creation during growth periods. Hiring needs to be stimulated through tax incentives that: promote and support self-employment and business start-ups, back innovative sectors with a high potential for job creation, improve the job market situation for the most vulnerable groups, such as young people and women, and fight against informal or non-declared employment. It is also important to note, however, that despite the high unemployment rate, there are increasingly more vacancies to be filled due to a lack of personnel with the appropriate skills. This gap needs to be filled by better planning for the needs of the job market and encouraging geographical mobility. In this sense, decisive progress needs to be made towards the creation of a European job market. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, our objective in the area of employment and social issues should continue to be the Europe 2020 strategy. Unfortunately, however, and partly due to the erroneous policies of previous governments, there are some countries, including my own, where there is no longer any room to manoeuvre and the only option left is to apply very rigorous budgetary adjustment programmes to tackle the sovereign debt crisis. Unemployment has reached unacceptable levels and continues to rise in some countries, with young people in a particularly serious situation. Poverty and the risk of social exclusion have increased considerably. There is a greater need than ever to redirect spending towards growth and job creation, and to avoid cutbacks in social policies that would further exacerbate the situation faced by the weakest in society. Fiscal consolidation is a necessary condition, but it is not enough to exit the crisis. Fiscal consolidation, growth and job creation should go hand in hand. The priority elements of national programmes and European Union social policy should be integrated, active inclusion strategies, measures to support sustainable job creation, particularly for the young, and, ultimately, carrying out the necessary reform of our labour markets, as is currently taking place in Spain.

 Madam President, Commissioner, poverty is the cause of the great inequalities on our planet. We cannot accept a system in the 21st century that continues to exacerbate differences between people because of their place of birth, gender, or their country’s development prospects. It is vital to create a new social, employment and economic framework that will ensure the basic needs of our population. Around 80 million people live below the poverty line, of whom more than half are women and 20 million are children. The platform that is the subject of this report could help to achieve greater social justice in Europe. It calls for priority to be placed on education and youth policies as a key element around which to build a fairer and more just society; for an overhaul of the insecure employment contracts that have proliferated in many Member States, undermining protection of the weakest groups in society; for the recognition of the rights of women living in rural areas, whose work is not valued and who are excluded from the basic rights enjoyed by all workers; and for an improvement in national home care programmes for the elderly. The austerity measures that are so badly needed at this time of crisis must not be incompatible with maintaining basic social services. Some 116 million people are threatened by poverty in the European Union, and 42 million live in conditions of severe material deprivation. We must ensure these people’s social protection and create a more prosperous environment that will help to reduce these figures. Lastly, I would like to say how pleased I am with the Council’s decision, following several months of stalled negotiations, to release food aid for the poorest members of society. It is essential to maintain this economic support in the new 2014-2020 funding cycle, with an annual maximum amount of EUR 500 million. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, at a time when Europe is experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis, with unemployment at 9.5%, I think it is very positive to discuss the Agenda for New Skills and Jobs today, and I want to congratulate Ms Bastos on the quality of her report, which forms part of the Europe 2020 strategy and will make a key contribution towards achieving the ambitious target of a 75% employment rate within the European Union. The 23 million unemployed Europeans demand that institutions and governments take the necessary measures and adopt the reforms that guarantee competitiveness in the job market and the creation of jobs. This agenda is on the right track, and we will only achieve this aim by working together within a strengthened single market. I want to make a specific reference to one of the sectors that create most jobs within the Union, and which is suffering the most at present: small and medium-sized enterprises. The importance of SMEs in the European Union is clear if we bear in mind that they generate 84% of jobs. In my country, Spain, that figure is even higher. This means we have to focus our efforts on the flexibility of the job market, the removal of cumbersome processes that slow down company creation, and to provide incentives for the self-employed and SMEs. Job flexibility and security will be key for understanding future legislation, job mobility and the productive collaboration between training institutions and companies. Veronica Lope Fontagné,

Madam President, first of all I would like to draw attention to the significant contribution that cohesion policy has made to economic growth and to the integration of the citizens and territories of the EU. For this reason, it was essential that Parliament should have its say on the policy to be followed from 2013 and it would be unfair to fail to mention the work carried out by Mr Pieper in his extensive report. Within cohesion policy the European Social Fund has been and will be a very important tool to assist Member States to adapt their policies to the Europe 2020 strategy and to combat the financial crisis. The Fund must concentrate its efforts on creating employment, promoting lifelong learning, helping in particular low-skilled workers, those outside the labour market, along with the most vulnerable groups, those who suffer discrimination and, of course, SMEs. It should also aim to achieve social inclusion and reduce poverty. In order to achieve these objectives it is imperative for the Social Fund, as part of the Structural Funds, to count on adequate resources and that administrative and procedural burdens are relaxed as much as possible and reduced to a minimum.

There are various reasons for supporting coal aid: strategic reasons, regional sustainability reasons and social reasons. With regard to the strategic reasons, we need to take into account the fact that the market is changing rapidly. Therefore, abandoning coal without having a viable alternative would not be appropriate. The environmental argument is not relevant either, as imported coal is equally as polluting as indigenous coal. Moreover, we should not forget that, on many occasions, the mines from which we import coal do not comply with social rights. With regard to regional sustainability, in many cases, the mines are in sparsely populated areas that are entirely dependent on the industry to maintain the region, and we risk turning our lands into deserts. The final and most important reason is the more than 180 000 families that could be affected. In Spain, in my region of Aragon, we are pioneers of renewable energy sources, with almost 60% energy independence. The only resource that we can store is coal, and we need more time in order to improve our technologies and apply them to mining, thus transforming our indigenous coal into clean, sustainable coal.

Madam President, Europe needs a strategy that will enable it to emerge stronger from the economic and financial crisis and tackle the long-term challenges that it has to face, such as, for example, the ageing population. In the strategy for the next decade, the Europe 2020 strategy, employment policy has to play a very important role. Its objectives must be sustainable growth, job creation and seeking greater social cohesion, and combating poverty is a new priority for the Union to which my group is committed. The strategy demonstrates the need to undertake structural reforms in order to improve the way that labour markets operate, while also improving competitiveness and productivity. We would not be consistent if we only thought about job creation in the future and allowed existing jobs to be destroyed, as is occurring in some sectors such as the coal sector at the moment, where a large number of jobs could be lost across Europe. Mining needs to be maintained as a strategic reserve and to complement renewable energy sources. If you will allow me, I will talk about my country, Spain, and my region, Aragon. For one of the provinces, Teruel – where the population density is around 12 inhabitants per square metre – the loss of around 5 000 jobs would mean the desertification of a whole area of land. We therefore need to focus, on the one hand, on consolidating and maintaining the jobs that we have at the moment and, on the other, on undertaking the reforms set out in this report.

 Madam President, we believe it to be essential to include the self-employed in this directive, and this view is shared by the representatives of both unions and employers’ associations in my country, who have expressly requested the inclusion of the self-employed in this directive. We believe that there are several reasons for their inclusion. Firstly, because of workers’ safety: self-employed hauliers deserve the same protection as other hauliers, not just when they are driving, but also when they are undertaking other tasks that are directly related to a road transport operation. Secondly, for reasons of fair competition, as bringing back discrimination between self-employed and employed workers will distort both the labour market and the transport market. Finally, it also seems inappropriate to me that each Member State should be able to apply the provisions of the directive to drivers if it so wishes. There needs to be a general rule for the entire EU, since the majority of hauliers work outside their own countries; without it, fair competition would be impeded. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, the future 2020 strategy must enable the European Union to correct the shortcomings detected in the Lisbon Strategy if we really want to create a competitive economic space, and one that is economically, socially and territorially cohesive. In spite of the fact that the postulates of the by now outdated Lisbon Strategy are still valid, I would like to point out that one of the reasons why it lost force was because of its highly complex structure, particularly its lack of clarity in defining the responsibilities and tasks incumbent upon the European Union and other levels of government, particularly those of a regional and local nature. Regions and local authorities must be included in the design and implementation of policies if we want the 2020 strategy to bear any fruit in the medium term. Our regions and cities are key agents in the development and implementation of a great deal of EU public investment related to growth and employment. The allocation of regional policy resources thus becomes a key factor in terms of meeting the European objectives that we are defining. I would like to point out that the resources invested from 2000 to 2006 by way of the European Regional Development Fund have enabled the creation of 1 400 000 jobs in the European Union, as well as the building of over 2 000 km of motorways. I would like to finish by pointing out once more the value of the European regional policy with respect to strategic goals such as growth and employment. Economic, social and territorial cohesion represents a basic objective guaranteed by the treaties. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately we are having to deal with this sad and now customary matter once again. I would like to express my respect and gratitude to all the professionals and volunteers who have contributed to the rescue and reconstruction effort in the affected areas, and I would like to express my particular condolences to the families of the victims. We need to provide help to the victims and pave the way so that the affected areas can recover quickly. We also need to continue working intensively in the area of prevention. Finally, and most importantly, I would call on the Spanish Government to use its current Presidency of the European Union to provide the impetus needed to modify the current European Union Solidarity Fund Regulation – a request already made on a number of occasions by the European Parliament – in order to achieve faster, more flexible and more efficient access to it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wish to express my solidarity with the families of all those affected by the dreadful news of the closure of the Antwerp plant. We are thinking not only of all those who will be directly affected and lose their jobs, but also of all the subcontracting companies that will suffer as a result. We must keep them in mind too. The Figueruelas plant is in my region, Aragón, so this matter affects us directly. We therefore advocate an active policy for the automotive sector, with new models that are more environmentally friendly and innovative and lead to the creation of new jobs. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to talk about the aid approved under the Temporary Framework aimed at reducing the problems that have arisen as a result of the economic crisis, and specifically about Opel. I would like to ask you whether the Commission is examining whether the aid received by Germany under the Temporary Framework was dependent on a prior agreement regarding the geographical distribution of the restructuring measures, which would not be in line with the purpose of this aid. If this is the case, I would like to know whether you agree with the company having the freedom to revise the distribution and restructuring of Opel according to its own economic and production criteria and maintaining the greatest possible number of jobs. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, when it was proposed that we have a debate in plenary on the future of Opel Europe, we were not yet aware of the purchase of the company by Magna and its Russian partner, Sberbank, on Thursday. After months of uncertainty, a new phase is beginning for Opel Europe which, for some, is grounds for hope, while for others, grounds for concern. We want the conditions of the final contract, which will be signed in the next few months, to be positive for the future of the company, and I hope that the German Government is right in thinking that this is the most reliable offer for the survival of the company. However, as a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and as someone from Aragon, where the Figueruelas factory, which is currently one of the most productive plants, is located, I must express my concern regarding the fate of the workers. There is talk that in its restructuring plan, Magna is considering making 10 560 workers redundant – currently 1 700 at the Aragon plant – to which many indirect redundancies will have to be added. We are aware that in order to save the company, there needs to be major restructuring, and that this will affect our workers, but we hope that the plan will be made using economic and productivity criteria, seeking to arrive at the best solution for everyone. We trust that, in the coming months, the governments of the affected countries will get involved along with Europe. This will mean that together, using economic criteria, we can support the viability of Opel with the lowest possible cost to the workers at all its European plants. Veronica Lope Fontagné  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, in this first plenary sitting of the legislature, we have to deal with this sad and now customary issue: natural disasters and, in particular, fires. Once again we are lamenting the proliferation of fires during the summer of 2009, which have caused human losses. Twenty lives have been lost, all in my country. Therefore, my first thought and my utmost sympathy is for the human suffering caused by these catastrophes. I would like to stress the disastrous impact that this type of disaster has on the lives of the populations that are affected, on their economies, employment, natural and cultural heritage, the environment and tourism. In my region, 22 000 hectares burned this summer, half of which were in areas that are protected due to their environmental importance. We must respond to these problems without hesitation, the people are demanding it. The European institutions cannot be incapable once more of finding an adequate solution for those who are affected. We need to be able to help the victims and to pave the way for restoring the affected areas. We need to continue to work hard on prevention and to proceed further with developing the European civil protection service. I would like to make two calls: firstly, I would like to call on the European Commission to analyse the situation and adopt the appropriate measures to compensate for the social costs inherent in the loss of jobs and sources of income for the inhabitants of the affected regions. Secondly, I would like to call on the Spanish Government, which will hold the Presidency of the Council from January 2010. The Spanish Government must be capable of passing on its feeling and concern to its counterparts. I consider it essential that it makes it a priority in its programme to unblock the reform of the European Solidarity Fund. The Spanish Presidency must also make a clear commitment to developing a common European strategy. It must also review prevention measures and the forestry management models that encourage large fires.
