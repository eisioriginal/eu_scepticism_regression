Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive concerning unfair commercial practices takes over a large part of the Green Paper on consumer protection, referred to by the Commissioner in his report. The reasons underlying the directive, which is designed to achieve higher consumer protection, are of an economic nature, and therefore relate to the completion and smooth operation of the internal market. In order for these general economic goals to be achieved, it is necessary to have a consumer protection policy to create European consumer confidence and to give a fresh impetus to international and European commercial transactions. The benefit of economic growth in the internal market ought to translate into both higher profits for businesses and higher protection and financial benefits for consumers. Through a joint policy for consumers and the harmonisation of the internal market it will also be possible to achieve price convergence. Conversely, unfair commercial practices lead to irrational financial behaviour in consumers, create distortions of competition and place barriers in the way of the proper functioning of the market. To this end, I endorse the Commission's approach, which is based on harmonisation, on the principle of mutual recognition of the country of origin, on a general prohibition on unfair commercial practices, on the identifying of specific criteria and examples and on the fact that the scope of application is limited to a framework directive based on business-consumer relations. The creation of a European legislative framework covering unfair commercial practices based on an appropriate level of harmonisation and aimed at clear and effective protection of consumers within the European Union will result in enhanced consumer confidence, an increase in international trade and will allow businesses to compete in a situation of legal clarity. While endorsing the basic approach and the main objectives of the directive, Parliament is nevertheless tabling a raft of amendments which, in our opinion, make a series of definitions and options clearer and unequivocal. In this regard, we have tabled an amendment concerning the legal basis, that is, a proposal to include, in addition to the legal basis proposed by the Commission in relation to the internal market, a legal basis based on Article 153 concerning consumer protection, so that we can reconcile the objective of harmonisation and mutual recognition of the internal market with the possibility for the Member States to maintain legislation which goes further to protect consumers. In this way, I believe that we can respond to the fears of those who think that greater harmonisation could lead to downward levelling of consumer protection or entail a step backwards with regard to existing legislation in many Member States. We also feel that it is important – with regard to the definition of consumers – to refer to a particular group of consumers, specifically vulnerable consumers who, as a result of various factors such as age, physical or mental abilities, their level of literacy or disability, need greater protection. Again with reference to Article 2, in relation to the definitions, it is important to amend the definition of professional diligence and I will retable an amendment in plenary in this regard. In essence, we support the Commission’s approach to the regulation of misleading and aggressive practices but we stress, though, that the information which consumers must receive about unfair commercial practices and codes of conduct is an essential element. Similarly we also think, in relation to codes of conduct, that the distinction between national and Community codes is slightly artificial, and we therefore point out the need to provide for appropriate, efficient mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the codes. Another important point, which concerns the codes of conduct as a method of regulating and resolving disputes between businesses and consumers, is arbitration, which cannot and should not replace or prevent recourse to administrative bodies, but which could play an important part. Therefore, as my fellow Members and Commissioner Byrne also pointed out, adoption of this directive and tomorrow’s report is of the utmost importance both for the development of the internal market and for consumer protection. I will conclude by thanking all my fellow Members who sought to improve this document and find a solution with their contributions. In particular, I would like to thank Mrs Paciotti, who deputised for me for a time when I was absent owing to ill health, and did an outstanding job on my behalf.

 Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission presented the communication on modernising company law and enhancing corporate governance in the European Union to the 
Council and the European Parliament. This communication responds to the report of 4 November 2002 of the High Level Group of Company Law Experts, which Commissioner Bolkestein appointed for the purpose of, precisely, recommending a modern regulatory framework for company law in Europe. The communication sets out the major political objectives that should guide all our future initiatives. It includes an action plan which lays down a timescale for a series of instruments, regulatory or otherwise, intended to be set up in the short, medium and long term, together with a grid indicating the priority of the measures themselves. In this proposal, the Commission has taken into account the need to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, basing its own regulatory approach on gradual application, without however, losing sight of regulatory developments at international level. There are two fundamental objectives sought by the Commission by reforming company law in Europe: strengthening shareholders’ rights and third parties’ protection; fostering efficiency and competitiveness of businesses. The main grounds underlying this initiative can be distinguished as the establishment of a more homogenous reference framework for company law in order to facilitate cross-border establishment and restructuring; the creation of conditions to prevent a repetition of recent corporate scandals – among which the Parmalat
 scandal in my country stands out owing to its size – the consequences of which have severely affected millions of people’s livelihoods, pensions, jobs, savings and investments; making the most of the advantages offered by the internal market. In order to realise the first objective proposed by the action plan, it is essential to provide an effective, up-to-date system to protect shareholders and their rights. We must also take into due consideration the position of certain third parties, who are particularly qualified in terms of their interests: creditors and workers. From this point of view, the Commission’s approach to the issue of governance seems simplistic and inadequate. Corporate governance is presented as a problem confined solely to relations between shareholders and management, as if a business were a body solely concerned with shareholders’ interests. In this way it is describing a virtual company, without giving due importance to workers and without more general responsibilities towards other categories of parties with an interest in the life of the company itself such as, for example, creditors and other stakeholders. With regard to the second objective, competitiveness of businesses may be fostered by various elements, including the inevitable existence of an appropriate regulatory framework for company law, firmly balanced between national and Community measures. I believe that the challenge that we must meet today is to aim to bring out the distinctive, characteristic features of European capitalism in the age of globalisation. In other words, we need to ascertain whether there is a true European model, which differs significantly from the North American model, not because it corresponds with and emerges from a framework of challenges and issues other than those which concern everyone in a context of economic globalisation, but because it considers social consequences and implications, making it more balanced and more human: a model, therefore, which seeks to conceive of the essential core of the corporate model, represented by a company’s interests, not just as the common interest of members and shareholders but as the interest of the company itself, a company which, as an independent economic operator, is also responsible for the specific interests of all parties outside and within the company itself. These include employees, customers, suppliers, creditors, the public administration, in its capacity as distributor of welfare and tax revenue, and the entire civil society, which is structurally connected, by means of the general and common interest, to the company’s prosperity and continuity. One final comment of a general nature: we need to obtain the correct balance between self-regulation and legislative regulation when the European governance framework is formulated. Today there is a widespread tendency to fill regulatory gaps with self-regulation codes. This is positive but it does not go far enough. We need to maintain a system of legally binding rules, equipped with effective sanctions, applied by public bodies entrusted with the tasks of guidance and monitoring. The aim must be precisely to globalise governance rules and to place the public supervisory authorities into a network. On this basis, we have focused our attention on certain key points, which I will just mention: transparency and shareholders’ rights, role of institutional investors, promotion of the role of independent directors, the specific issue of corporate pyramids, rights of workers as particularly qualified creditors of the company and the centrality of a system of public oversight of audits.

Mr President, many things have already been said and, in the minute at my disposal, I will not even be able to cover the most important aspects. I believe that there is no doubt as to the need to adopt a statute, even from the point of view of the role and legitimacy of this Parliament. Furthermore, everyone in my group, in particular Mr Rothley and Mr Barón Crespo and the Italian delegation, have always declared themselves in favour of the Statute and have always supported the need for it, voting for it with conviction last June. I believe, however, that we should not delude ourselves, Mr President. What we are, in fact, discussing today – and, if it is necessary, let us do so – is not the Statute, but the adjustments of salaries. I think that it is rather humiliating for Parliament, but that is all we are discussing. Let us call a spade a spade. If it is the only thing we can do – and this is the Council’s responsibility – let us do it; but we must not call it a statute, because this is not a statute.

 Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for her work because I feel that - as this morning’s debate has confirmed - this is a very complex, sensitive issue. As has already been said, software plays an important role in countless industries; it is a basic form of creation and expression. Software is, in addition, a field of specialised engineering and a basic human activity, with more than ten million professional developers throughout the world and tens of millions of people creating software. Independent software developers and small businesses play a fundamental role in innovation in this area, above all in Europe. Europe is at the forefront of the culture of information technology: 71% of open source software developers work in Europe and only 13% in the US. Patents should not, therefore, permit the monopolisation of tools for the expression, creation, dissemination and exchange of information and knowledge, must not hold back the development of research and knowledge. The stakes are considerable because this is a matter of guaranteeing that research and innovation continue to be free and – according to the spirit of Lisbon - to stimulate economic growth based on knowledge, to bring about the stimulation of software-based innovation and inventions at all levels and to avoid production and trade monopolies for products that use the software. Thus, some fundamental points of the Commission proposal need to be modified and improved on, so that the regulation is a step towards clear, severe limitation of the conditions for patentability. A great deal has been said about technical contribution, industrial application, the meaning of computer-implemented invention; the conditions for the industrial use of an invention based on software filed for a patent must be extended to the product as well as the method. This is why Commissioner Bolkestein said that he is concerned that the amendments tabled in this House will be adopted, For my part, I have to say that I am concerned that, if they are not adopted, we will not be able to support the proposal on the table.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us today slots perfectly into European policy on equal opportunities, which, as we know, has two basic branches: specific measures benefiting women and gender mainstreaming, or the incorporation of the perspective of gender equality into all stages and levels of public policy by all the actors involved in the decision-making process. Gender budgeting is the application of the principle of gender mainstreaming in the budgetary process. As we are all aware, budgets are not gender-neutral, but reflect the way in which power is distributed within society. Whenever they define revenue and expenditure policies, public budgetary authorities at all levels are taking policy decisions. Budgets are not merely economic tools but, in fact, key instruments with which political authorities shape a society's model of socio-economic development and criteria for internal redistribution and prioritise the measures to be taken in respect of policies and the needs of their own citizens. The impact this has is not the same on men and women. The way in which public budgets are normally drawn up tends to ignore the differences – in terms of roles and responsibilities – between men and women, and, in most cases, the indicators and data used fail to make any gender distinction. Although they are presented as neutral economic instruments, public budgets, in actual fact, reflect and thus reproduce the socio-economic disparities already present in the Community. Analysing budgetary policies on the basis of the different impacts they have on men and women and adjusting them accordingly serves to ensure that public budgets meet appropriate criteria in terms of fairness and cost-effectiveness. In order to be not merely fair but also efficient, public spending must help to promote the development and exploit the potential of all sections of society. It is therefore a matter of adopting an economic and social approach based on the principle that, even in an open and globalised market economy, economic and social development are considered inseparable and interconnected. An economy cannot be competitive, dynamic and healthy in the long term unless the productive, commercial and financial processes are backed up by a stable, cohesive and fair society in which human rights, resources and capacities are properly developed. The strengthening, modernisation and reorganisation of public intervention, and hence budgetary policies, with a view to social development are, in fact, an absolutely essential intangible investment in capacities, empowerment and new resources and opportunities for economies wishing to be dynamic and competitive through being knowledge-based, in accordance with the objective set by the European Council in Lisbon. Although this is the first time that Parliament has discussed gender budgeting, it is by no means a new concept. The Platform for Action drawn up at Beijing at the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women specifically refers to it; an experts' working group has been set up within the Council of Europe's Directorate-General for Human Rights; the Commission itself, after the conference organised by the Belgian Presidency, set up a working group of experts; but, above all, numerous experiments have been carried out in Eastern countries, starting with Australia, which adopted this instrument – like many developing countries, moreover – as early as 1984, and there have been interesting experiments carried out within the European Union too for some years now at both national and local level. What are the specific objectives of the report? Firstly, raising awareness among the public and political and economic actors at all levels. Disseminating information on the gender budgeting strategy and method among the institutions of the European Union and the Member States. Calling on the Commission, which has already expressed its support, to produce and distribute as widely as possible an information brochure on gender budgeting. Involving the actors operating in the Community at all levels in the building of budgets. Most importantly, indicating an action framework for the implementation of gender budgeting, providing for bottom-up democratic participation and the involvement of organised individuals, NGOs and women's associations. I will end, Madam President, with this point: wherever, especially at local level, experiments of this kind are already underway, they have also served to wipe away the indifference and detachment we see today at all levels in relationships between the citizens and the public authorities. This is an instrument which brings great participation as well as great justice.

Mr President, the fact that the European Parliament is addressing today this major, sensitive issue concerning the health of millions of people, millions of women in our continent and throughout the world is due, as we all acknowledge, to the determination and sensitivity of Mrs Jöns, whom I too would like to thank from the bottom of my heart. Considering that breast cancer can be cured in 90% of cases if diagnosed early on and properly treated, as is shown, not least, by the figures provided by Mrs Jöns and by current research; considering that high quality breast screening within the framework of a regional or national programme can reduce the breast cancer mortality rate by as much as 35% for women between the ages of 50 and 69, and that, according to scientific studies recorded, the mortality rate can be reduced by 20% for women between 40 and 49 too, every woman should have access to screening, to treatment and to high quality aftercare, irrespective of where they live, their social position, profession or level of education. The main important points of Mrs Jöns’ report are precisely an excellent prevention strategy, rapid treatment and appropriate post-operative care. Thus, the call to the Member States and the Commission – I would like to thank the Commissioner for her words this morning, which were reassuring – to make combating breast cancer a priority in health policy and to develop and implement effective strategies for increasing prevention, with the goal of reducing the average breast cancer mortality rate in the Union by 25% by 2008, is a key point of this report, as is the right for women suffering from breast cancer to be treated by a multidisciplinary team. It is therefore important for the Member States to develop a wide network of certified multidisciplinary breast units which meet specific quality criteria. One last point which I want to stress is the importance of research. The Sixth Framework Programme allocates funds to research: that is all well and good, but we need to insist that these funds for research increase, thanks, not least, to increased commitment from the Member States.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the Commission for its proposal for guidelines and the Commissioner for his words. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, for I feel that he has endeavoured in a short space of time to take into account all the different viewpoints in the House, without compromising on quality objectives. I would like to focus on a number of considerations. If we take into account the economic climate and the experience we have gained in recent years on the European employment strategy, it would appear that the Commission has already endeavoured in its proposals to define specific objectives which I consider to be particularly important because they are in line with the recommendations made by the Commission on the basis of the evaluation of national employment plans. I therefore believe that this strategy is becoming increasingly specific. If the Community institutions are to foster this tendency towards specific measures, we need firmer support from many Member States. In this regard, I would like to focus on a number of points. The Commission, the rapporteur and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have defined precisely a number of aspects of the Commission’s communication, such as the need to invest in quality and services to make female employment a reality. In all the countries, some of them in particular, this aspect of the employment situation is distressing, in that there is both a high inactivity rate and a high unemployment rate. Matters can be improved by providing training for women and the services necessary to make the market favourable to female employment. The amendments adopted in committee are along these lines. Then we need a more effective partnership at Member State level involving governments, national Parliaments and local authorities in their respective roles. I feel these are tangible goals. This is a point on which we all agree but which is incompatible with cutting taxes across the board, for we cannot have it both ways: either we have investment resources or we reduce taxation.

 Mr President, many Members have already spoken about the Council’s failure to take the opportunity to observe and recognise the European Parliament’s prerogatives laid down by the Treaty and to propose a legal base providing for Parliamentary codecision in respect of the regulation on the Statute for a European Cooperative Society. It is important to remember that, as early as 1991, the Council specified this legal basis in respect of the three proposals for regulations it presented at that time, on a European Cooperative Society, a European association and a European mutual society respectively, as well in respect of the original proposal on the European company. The Council’s attitude is even more incomprehensible in the light of its previous actions, and so I hope that it will reconsider its position after the House votes tomorrow. In this connection – as the rapporteur has already explained – the aim of the proposal for a regulation on the Statute for a Cooperative Society is harmonisation, to approximate Member States’ laws, in other words to remove all the barriers hindering the functioning of the internal market. It does not regulate matters of taxation or competition – although these are important and will have to be addressed in future – or matters of copyright or insolvency, but merely the structure of the societies, referring systematically to the national law of the country in which the cooperative society has its registered office. That said, we cannot fail to agree that it is important and urgent that we find a solution for the creation of the cooperative society, given that work on this project has been at a standstill for decades and that it was only in December 2000 that the Council finally reached political agreement on the substance, the content of the regulation and the Directive on Worker Involvement, 
which is linked to the creation of the European Cooperative Society. Over these years – or decades, rather – the world of cooperatives in Europe has expanded greatly, acquired economic weight and shown that it actually has a key social role to play, particularly in terms of employment. On a number of occasions during these years, the European Parliament has expressed itself, through various reports, on the importance of the third sector for the economy, on the essential role it plays in preserving society, on its proven ability – borne out by numerous studies – to create jobs, not least high-quality jobs. Mr Hughes mentioned a successful European Parliament initiative which revealed the zeal and skill shown by the third sector and the cooperative sector in responding to the challenges of employment and social cohesion. With the proposed amendments, which I hope will be adopted tomorrow and taken into consideration by the Commission and the Council, the European Parliament is enhancing the proposal, introducing into the regulation the changes necessary to harmonise the statute and the provisions of the Directive on Worker Involvement. Information and consultation rights are laid down, to ensure that they are fully respected during the pre-legislative phase and whenever any structural changes or modifications are made. I will end, Mr President, by congratulating the two rapporteurs for my part too, for they have worked together and developed these two important reports side by side.

 Mr President, I too should like to thank Mrs Avilés Perea for her excellent report and, to tell the truth, there is not much to add to what she has written and what has been said this evening. I therefore want to focus on the lessons we should learn from the Avilés Perea report, from what the Commissioner has said and also, I believe, from the Gröner report. First of all, I think it is important to say that these two initiative reports aim to be a tool and a stimulus for the subsequent steps that the Commission, Parliament and the Member States have to achieve, because they focus on the tools that we should have available both at the planning stage and at the stage of assessing the impact that the policies we issue have on the actual, real lives of our citizens, especially women. From this perspective, I think there are some important, positive examples: the indicators defined in the European employment strategy and the impact assessment carried out by the Commission can be a splendid benchmark for doing the same thing in other policy areas too, for instance in the assessment of Structural Fund programmes, and I am pleased to have heard the Commissioner say this evening that these will be the points taken into consideration in the mid-term review. It is necessary, therefore, to develop the tools of statistics, the presence of women in decision-making positions and committees, and impact assessment indicators. To these I believe another tool will be added, which we are developing as a guideline in the Committee on Women’s Rights: budget structure from a gender perspective. I think this will be an important package that we can work on together, in order to have some effect on the implementation of these policies at all levels – national, regional and local – in the Member States. We must, I think, provide greater information on the tools available, emphasise the positive things that have been done – even if we are not completely happy because there is still a lot to do – but we must not become dejected that we do not have any tools at our disposal: the tools are there, so let us try and use them!

 Mr President, unlike the rapporteur, who spoke earlier, I believe that the European employment strategy has played a major part in combating unemployment thus far and that it has had a positive effect on national labour market policies – not in all the Member States, of course, but certainly in some. Then, because of the ambitious goals we set ourselves, the Lisbon Summit was a decisive step, with the goals being updated each year by specific indicators, just as the Commission’s assessment of the national plans and the respective recommendations are a point of reference and an incentive to follow the example of those countries which are more successful than others in obtaining positive results by means of a proactive policy involving the social partners at all levels. Each year, the European Parliament has consistently succeeded in its resolutions in finding the right balance between flexibility and security and putting economic policy, employment policy and social policy on an equal footing. Now, in the face of the new generation of guidelines proposed by the Commission, which seek, as has been said, to achieve three objectives – to bring the employment rate further into line with the Lisbon objectives, to improve the quality of jobs and to promote a labour market which is open to socially vulnerable groups – it is a little surprising that the rapporteur proposed in committee and is proposing once again in the form of amendments in the House a series of instruments – reducing taxation across the board, recourse to what is known as 
‘minor work’, the introduction of excessive flexibility – which are incompatible with improving job quality, investment in human resources or effective reconciliation of family and professional life which is not detrimental in terms of security. I feel that these instruments serve the purposes of the ideological debates taking place in some of the Member States – Italy, for example – rather than stimulating and coordinating the Union. This line was partially adjusted in committee and the result is more balanced, and that is why, as has been said, we do not support the amendments. I would like to end with a comment. Mrs Bastos rightly upheld the paragraph of the resolution which calls for greater cooperation between universities and research centres. It is a shame that her group has tabled an amendment seeking to replace cooperation with competition.

Mr President, I too would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten for what they have told us today. I too, like other fellow Members, recently went to Afghanistan with a European Parliament delegation and I can bear witness to the truth of the things reported by Commissioner Patten. Let us not forget that we found a country ravaged by 23 years of war and years of drought. The progress made in one year since the first Bonn Conference is truly remarkable, and likewise we should applaud the determination, selflessness and competence of our Commission officials in Kabul. All this is true: schools have been opened, they have started to rebuild some health facilities; valuable work is being done, particularly in terms of supporting the administration. In this connection, I would like to urge Commissioner Patten not to abandon the aspect of specific personnel training, including for customs officers, which is fundamental. It is also true, however – and the last Bonn Conference showed this to some degree – that the most committed donor countries are asking the Karzai Government to show more determination. There has been some criticism: reforms announced by the Karzai Government itself have been delayed; even though a commission has been appointed to draw up the new Constitution, it is being obstructed by religious issues, by minorities, whereas it needs to go ahead, especially with a specific acknowledgement of women’s rights too; security is still a serious problem; there is no judicial system and there is no national defence force; an operative police force is still lacking. All this is true. The European Union, which has done a great deal, must therefore persevere on these issues. Lastly – a final word on women’s rights – I would like to refer here, to the European Parliament, to the appeal which the Minister, Mrs Sarabi, made to us: each donor country has chosen a specific area of intervention; however, no one has chosen the specific issue of women’s rights. This is an urgent appeal that I am making to the European Union and to us all lest we forget this: there is no chance of making progress or finding a way out of this situation unless women are directly involved in this process.

 Mr President, I would like to inform you and my fellow Members of a matter which I consider quite serious. In a press release issued on 25 November, Belgian State Railways announced that, as of 15 December, it will be withdrawing the Brussels/Milan train which, for years, has been the main link between Belgium and northern Italy. Major areas are served along its route, which is also of relevance to the European Parliament as it links Brussels, Luxembourg and Alsace-Lorraine – that is, the European Parliament’s three places of work – and it is used by thousands and thousands of travellers. The press release states that until 15 December, the running costs will be divided between the various legs of the journey and that, after this date, that will no longer be the case. Mr President, at the very moment when we are discussing European integration and the need to involve our citizens and convince them of the importance of integration and the positive effect it will have on their daily lives too, this decision is particularly worrying. I personally and, likewise, many of my fellow Members, often use this night train to return to Milan from Strasbourg. I wish to draw your attention to this problem and call on Parliament and the Presidency to make inquiries and attend to this matter. Moreover, the decision will take effect precisely as of 15 December: close, therefore, to the Christmas holidays.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her patient work on a difficult issue. Parliament can debate today, and tomorrow, I hope, it will be able to adopt a report that improves the Commission proposal. It is, as has already been said, a very problematic dossier, because the different countries have very different systems to deal with this matter – they range from situations of all-embracing guarantees to a lack of any kind of protection. I too applaud the Commission’s initiative, which is not a straitjacket restricting autonomy and subsidiarity but comes after 20 years of attempts by employers and workers to reach an agreement. I believe there are three basic objectives of equality of treatment contained in the proposal: equality of treatment for temporary workers compared with other workers in terms of job security and status; respect for established social standards within the user enterprises, through equal treatment in terms of pay and working conditions of temporary workers and other, comparable workers in the user enterprises; and recognition of the work of agencies supplying temporary workers as a legitimate professional activity, removing unnecessary restrictions, authorisations and prohibitions. The purpose of the directive is thus to guarantee and harmonise a common minimum level of protection for temporary workers, without any discrimination. It is a directive that places temporary work within its own part of the labour market, recognising its importance and value without, however, pushing it until it becomes almost the only system for hiring people. I also believe, since Lisbon has been mentioned, that this directive regulates temporary work in a way that brings it qualitatively into line with the Lisbon objectives.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like, first of all, to congratulate Mrs Smet, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on her excellent work and on her supreme willingness to take into account the wealth of suggestions made during the debate in committee. The balanced participation of women in decision-making bodies is an issue which is frequently raised and with regard to which Europe has often emphasised the need to take measures, and this issue has by no means been resolved. As the Commissioner said, there is a democratic deficit here in all areas of society – economic, social and political. This report seeks to take stock of the situation in the social and political fields, of the representation of women among the social partners. With regard to this matter, the first thing that becomes clear is the lack of systematic data. There is very little information available about the participation of women inside the organisational structures and internal decision-making bodies of the social partners, while even less information is available about the gender-specific composition of delegations of negotiators in the social dialogue. Moreover, there are no statistics available about the advisory bodies in which social partners are represented. The European Trade Union Confederation has made genuine efforts to compile statistics, but it encountered many difficulties because of the poor cooperation of the national trade unions. In any case, these studies reveal a pyramid structure, in which about 40% of the total number of trade union members are women, and the percentage falls to less than half that figure the nearer one gets to the decision-making structures at the top of the pyramid. There is even less information available regarding employers’ organisations. All this means that women are very poorly represented in negotiating delegations, which has an impact on the success of the equal opportunities policy too. Indeed, in recent years, at the request, not least, of Europe, a number of strategies have been implemented, tailored to the situations of the different Member States, which have led to an improvement in the situation, although it still remains wholly unsatisfactory. In Italy, for example, a policy of positive measures has been implemented within the trade associations, facilitated by legislation and by the funding of specific training projects, to encourage the participation of women in administrative bodies, and, in many cases, this has resulted in organisations including quotas in their statutes. It is true that all this has yielded significant positive results but they have been almost exclusively at local level: progress stops when we reach national decision-making levels. There is a direct link between the participation of women in decision-making bodies and negotiating bodies and the pursuit of an equal opportunities policy. This connection is confirmed, not least, by the results of research promoted by the Dublin Foundation on the subject of ‘Equal Opportunities and Collective Bargaining’ in the Union, which stresses that the participation of women negotiators has yielded positive results in terms of reducing the existing inequalities, increasing the attention paid to reconciling work and family life and tackling the issue of wage inequality between men and women. It is therefore necessary, as Mrs Smet’s report calls, for the European Commission to make a start on the compilation of data and the establishment of a database relating to the representation of women among the social partners so that indicators can be established with a view to increasing the influence exercised by women in decision-making bodies, to create a database relating to the results of collective bargaining in the context of equal opportunities and to use it for the dissemination of best practice, and to urge the social partners to create networks among women negotiators and women administrators with a view to their exchanging experience and expertise and, in their employment policy, to develop further the role allotted to them in the promotion of equal opportunities. The development of the social dialogue at European level will certainly yield benefits in terms of influence, effectiveness and success in the pursuit of the objectives if more gender balance is developed at all levels, including in the socio-economic context.

 Mr President, in its opinion on the Green Paper on compensation to crime victims, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market congratulates the Commission on the approach it has proposed and adopted and welcomes the definition of the three major objectives for possible action at Community level: firstly, the need to guarantee crime victims within the Union the possibility of obtaining state compensation, providing for a safety net for all Union residents; secondly, the need to adopt the necessary measures to limit the unfair effects that result from the great differences that currently exist between levels of compensation in the different Member States, which, in practice, vary according to the Member State of residence of the victim or the Member State in which they were the victims of the crime; and, thirdly, the need to facilitate cross-border victims’ access to state compensation, ensuring that victims’ access to compensation is not excessively dependent upon the place in the Union in which the crime was committed. However, the Committee on Legal Affairs has expressed some considerations – and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Angelilli, for having included in the body of the text all the amendments contained in the Committee on Legal Affairs’ opinion – to the effect that compensation should cover both material and non-material damage caused to the victim. Generous time limits should be set for the submission of claims for state compensation; similar provisions must apply concerning the dies a quo
 (the date from which the time limit is calculated) in order to avoid disparities in the way cases are treated. Moreover, it is crucial that harmonised compensation claims forms are drawn up in all the Community languages and that the minimum procedural guarantees include, inter alia
, the right to impartial judgment, the right to be represented by a lawyer, the right of access to the procedure and easier access for cross-border victims to State compensation. In conclusion, the Community initiative on compensation to victims would indeed be a major contribution to the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice.

 Mr President, wars, the Soviet presence and the Taliban have left a State without institutions or industry and with its agriculture struggling to survive. It has left a State with levels of poverty and illiteracy, including returning illiteracy, in men as well as women, which are truly incredible. Furthermore, the lack of integration between the different cultural, social, religious and ethnic identities making up Afghan society increases the complexity of the problem with which the transitional government has to deal on a daily basis. As has been said, governing this country means not just carrying out essential institutional reforms, starting with the Constitution, but creating a basic banking system from scratch with all speed, disseminating education and promoting respect between the citizens and ethnic groups, rebuilding cities and infrastructure, separating military and civil affairs and creating anew industry and agriculture which will be able to survive in a globalised world. The challenge facing the transitional government is not inconsiderable, for it is a question of doing everything at once with all possible speed, as cheaply as possible and with the widest possible participation. Clearly, these tasks are not easy, particularly if they have to be carried out within a relatively short space of time. Moreover, Mr Karzai has explicitly undertaken to achieve a stable peace between the citizens, between ethnic groups and between the sexes, to establish the bases for democratisation of the country in the transitional government’s two years of office. However, as Commissioner Patten said, the path is still very tortuous. There has been no real, practical improvement in the situation of women, in particular, despite Mr Karzai’s statements. The level of illiteracy among women is incredible – six or seven percent compared to 39% previously. Even the new government has deteriorated from this point of view, with some warlords assuming a political role not just in the decentralised administrations but in the Kabul government too. Censorship has increased, as has been mentioned, and women continue to wear the burka
 and are marginalised, particularly in the southern and south-eastern regions. The Union must multiply its endeavours to ensure that the hopes which were raised at Bonn are not completely dashed and that the present situation of far-reaching inequality, discrimination and failure to respect human rights does not become established in the long-term.

 Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commission for its proposals, but I would also like to draw attention to a subject which is inextricably linked to the improvement of economic and employment policy coordination, and that is the debate, which is quite heated in some Member States, on the Stability Pact and the flexibility thereof. I would like to ask the Commission how it intends to respond, to distinguish between the attitude of certain Member States, of certain governments, which would like to revise the Stability Pact and make it less rigid – in some cases for the simple reason that they are having difficulty keeping their public finances under control but want to keep promises they have made to cut taxes at such a difficult economic time – and the attitude and position of others, which are putting forward what I believe are sensible proposals to turn the Growth Pact and investments to good account, making good use of the golden rule that the most fruitful public investments have to be incorporated into and integrated with the Lisbon strategy. Lastly, how will this be coordinated with the proposals the Commission has presented this evening?

Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Beysen, very much for his thorough work and for his attention to all the issues which, as the previous speaker, Mr Lehne, pointed out too, have been the subject of a great deal of debate in the Commission. I believe that it was a good idea to present the proposal in the form of a regulation, for I feel that a regulation is genuinely the most suitable vehicle for laying down uniform rules on specific, clearly-defined issues, for guaranteeing price transparency and for increasing legal certainty, and that it is the best way to meet the need for uniform rules now the euro has been introduced. Above all, the regulatory approach makes it possible to create a legal framework on the basis of which the consumer and other market actors can obtain sufficient information to be able to make informed decisions. The text before us, which we are to vote on tomorrow, is, in any case, the result of thorough analysis in committee and in the committees responsible for drawing up opinions. It amends and improves many important aspects of the original proposal relating to the provision of protection and guarantees for consumers, minors, small and medium-sized enterprises and healthy competition, and the introduction of the subsidiarity mechanism. Indeed, an amendment introduces the principle of subsidiarity, on the basis of which the Member States can partially limit trade communications on grounds of consumer protection, safeguarding competition or the protection of providers. I feel that the provision adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market – increasing protection for minors, particularly as regards personal data and potentially dangerous free samples and premiums – is especially important. In addition, the consumer is also safeguarded as regards the court or out-of-court settlement of claims. All in all, I feel this is a well-balanced proposal which takes into account both the need to make the international market fully functional and the need to protect the consumer.

 Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Schmid for his work. The Commission communication, which I consider to be extremely positive, follows the consultation process launched by the Commission in 2000 on “Acting locally for employment”, which involved a large number of actors at European, national and local levels and confirmed the opinion that Parliament had expressed on a number of occasions in the past. It also tallied with the positions of the Commission regarding the necessity and importance of making good use of local actors. If we want to achieve the goal set by the Heads of State and Government at Lisbon of implementing a European employment strategy which will achieve full, high quality employment while promoting social cohesion by 2010, there is no doubt that we need to give due consideration to, make use of and support the efforts being made by actors at local level, and to tailor our involvement to the sphere in which they are operating. To this end, we need to urge the Member States to follow the recommendations we have consistently provided at European level, namely partnership, support for local employment projects and support for all the actors – whether social bodies or non-governmental or ‘third sector’ organisations – giving primary responsibility to the public institutions. I feel that we really must continue, as we are doing with this communication, to call upon the Member States to ensure through the European employment strategy and the launching of national plans that the local actors are listened to, for it is local officials who have to respond in person to the daily challenges represented by the new demands for job creation and use of mobility instruments and life-long training instruments, which are crucial to the achievement of this objective. I will end by pointing out that the forum which the Commission has undertaken to organise for next year would appear essential. Secondly, in my own view and in the opinion of the Socialist Group, the amendments tabled are superfluous and run counter to the spirit of unity which characterised the vote on the Communication in committee. We would therefore like the text adopted in committee to remain in its current form.

 Mr President, in recent days, I and my colleagues have been inundated with e
-mails and faxes containing urgent calls to vote against Mrs Van Lancker’s report because it would be an invitation to legalise abortion throughout Europe. This is the result of an extremely disturbing false information campaign launched by the right, which must be firmly condemned. The report addresses the sensitive issue of sexual and reproductive health and rights, women’s reproductive health and the dissemination of contraceptive practices, it focuses at length on a policy of health and sexual education policy for young people, and, of course, it is also concerned with unwanted pregnancies and abortion. This issue is, however, addressed in the context of the recommendations made to the Member States and the candidate countries with the aim of safeguarding women’s reproductive health and rights. The rapporteur makes numerous recommendations regarding prevention. The governments of the Member States and the candidate countries are called upon to endeavour to implement a health and social policy which will reduce recourse to abortion, particularly through the establishment of a network of counselling and family planning services. The report proposes that impartial, scientific information should be provided on reproductive health, including the prevention of unwanted pregnancies. It stresses that interrupting pregnancies should not be promoted as a family planning method and recommends that, in order to protect women’s reproductive health and rights, abortion must be legal, safe and accessible to all. In any case, the experience of the countries which have legislation in place on the interruption of pregnancies reveals that fewer abortions take place if they do not have to be carried out illegally but can be performed in safe establishments under strict medical control without risks to health. In Italy, for example, the abortion rate fell by 40% between 1980 and 1998. Mrs Van Lancker does not undermine the principle of subsidiarity in this extremely balanced report. She does not suggest that the European institutions should take over the competences and responsibilities of the Member States, but recommends that they adopt a policy of prevention – sexual education – and reminds us all that sexuality and reproductive health are, first and foremost, women’s rights.

 Mr President, this evening, we are discussing conciliation, the outcome of the negotiations on a major proposal for a directive amending the 1976 directive, and we are satisfied, whatever Mrs Lulling says. She never fails to reiterate her opinion, but if Parliament, Mrs Hautala and the entire Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities had followed Mrs Lulling’s approach, we would not be here today expressing our satisfaction, for hers was without a doubt a minority proposal. (Applause)
 I would, however, like to thank Mrs Hautala because, despite the difficulties of the negotiations, we have succeeded in achieving an excellent result. Why were the negotiations difficult? Because the difference between the Council and Parliament’s positions was considerable. Mrs Hautala’s approach and the commendable cooperation of all – and I repeat – all the groups, and the willingness shown by Commissioner Diamantopoulou and the Spanish Presidency, whom I would like to thank, to find solutions, mean that the result we have achieved is significant. Why is it significant? Because, three years on from the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we can, at last, say that things are starting to change. The Treaty of Amsterdam was a leap forwards in terms of recognition of the principle of equal opportunities and we now, at last, have a directive which provides specific, accurate definitions of direct and indirect discrimination, a directive which, in addition to providing an important definition of harassment and sexual harassment, recognises without a shadow of doubt that sexual harassment is to be considered direct discrimination and is therefore a punishable offence, a directive which recognises the importance of maternity and paternity leave and adoption and therefore the need and the right of mothers and fathers returning from such leave to be provided with equal or equivalent work, a directive which recognises the need for and compels each Member State to lay down equal and proportionate sanctions, a directive which, moreover, recognises independent bodies and makes companies responsible for producing equal opportunities plans, thus making positive actions under Article 141 possible. I see this result as significant, Mr President, particularly because the matter is being discussed by the Convention and, on the basis of this result, we will be able to call for a further step forward to be taken in the Convention too.

 Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, almost three years on from the Tampere Council, which established a strategy for creating a European area of freedom, security and justice and laid the foundations for a work programme and a common policy in the field of immigration and asylum, we can now take stock of the progress made or not made and of the current state of affairs. I am afraid to say that the result is neither positive nor encouraging. Implementing the Tampere conclusions, the Commission has indicated through a legislative programme the need to develop a proactive policy which recognises that the pressure from migration is going to continue and that ordered migration can bring benefits for Europe, for the migrants themselves and for their countries of origin. The approach proposed by the Commission involves a comprehensive policy which addresses all the issues – economic, social, political and humanitarian – and provides for close cooperation between government actions and initiatives of the social partners, the associations and local and regional authorities. As we know and as you, President-in-Office, have pointed out, all this means working on five policies simultaneously: defining legal immigration channels, combating illegal immigration, equal treatment in line with the principles of non-discrimination against non-Community citizens and with integration policies, partnership with the countries of origin, and the establishment of a European asylum system. Despite this positive line taken by the Commission and the incorporation of Parliament’s contributions, our progress is neither positive nor encouraging. I feel that the Council is largely responsible for all this for, on the one hand, it is laying down a path to follow – as it did, indeed, at Tampere – and, on the other, it has constantly failed to fulfil its undertakings or to shoulder its ensuing responsibilities. The Council and many governments are overlooking the fact that one of the causes of immigration is precisely our own labour shortage. We have to admit that we have failed to identify the needs of our labour market or to see the need to combat illegal working, to see the link between these concerns 
and an effective immigration policy. We focus purely on security issues which, although important, need to be addressed in a balanced way with a policy based on respect for the law and the rights of individuals. As regards security and immigration, however, some of the governments in Europe, such as the Italian Government, tend to practise a combination of alarmism and utopianism. Immigration is seen solely as a threat against which the country must defend itself, people’s fears are fed and it is promised that the problem will miraculously disappear; populist slogans imply that the State and the police are justified in anything they do to secure order. The opposite is true, however. A responsible security policy must be based on two, interconnected pillars: firstly, holding the doors open to the flows of legal immigration, with precise rules and limits, and I do mean holding the doors open, not flinging them wide. The other pillar is an effective fight against illegal immigration. Failure to do the former will mean having to step up the latter, however, for the most desperate people, those determined – or forced – to emigrate, throw themselves into the arms of the criminal traffickers offering to take them to Europe in their floating death traps. Although it is true that the citizens’ concerns cannot, indeed must not be ignored, it is also true that these concerns cannot be addressed, much less resolved, through alarmism or blind, repressive policies.

 Mr President, I too would like to thank the two rapporteurs for the contribution they have made with this report. I would, however, like to focus in particular on Mrs Avilés Perea’s report, for I feel that, as has already been said, the annual report is a genuinely important instrument which allows us all to follow up, assess and monitor the initiatives undertaken by the Union and the Member States and the coherence of these initiatives with the global legislation and strategy defined at Union level. As the rapporteurs have already said, although the 2000 report does record some progress, it reveals a Europe which is still a hostile environment for women and which is, in many respects, a long way from achieving the goal of equal opportunities: the female unemployment rate is higher than the male unemployment rate, the employment rate is still a long way off the goal set at Lisbon, the labour market is still segregated, women continue to be heavily under-represented in positions of responsibility and, above all, there is a pay gap which is frankly scandalous considering that this is Europe in the third millennium. With the Community framework strategy on equal opportunities, the mainstreaming of the gender dimension and the Community equal opportunities policy as a whole, we are heading in the right direction. In particular, I feel that the 2002 employment guidelines and the amending of the directive on access to employment and training, which were successfully completed in conciliation last week, the directive on gender equality based on Article 13, in the context of which I, like Mrs Fraisse, feel that we should call more strongly for the individualisation of rights – a directive which the Commission is to present shortly – and the programmes combating violence against women and trafficking are new, important elements which fill gaps in the overall strategy. However, we need to do more. With regard to the pay gap between men and women, the under-representation of women in positions of responsibility and the balanced participation of women and men in decision-making processes, we need to be more forceful in making everyone – the social partners, the political organisations, the institutions and the Member States – shoulder their responsibilities, and we should maybe introduce more effective instruments that provide better incentives than those used hitherto.

 Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the result achieved in conciliation and I would like to thank the Commission for its contribution to the achievement of this agreement and for its support. The measures included in the decision we are discussing today are important funding instruments for achieving the strategic objective set at the Lisbon Summit, and the decision will, indeed, serve to increase cooperation between the Member States on labour market policies. The gamble of implementing the European employment strategy through open coordination in recent years has started to pay off. It is important to note, however – and we too see evidence of this every day – that there is a huge information gap between citizens regarding the existence of this strategy, its objectives and the procedures for implementing it. That is why the European Parliament persisted in calling for all the information measures aimed at raising public awareness, particularly the awareness of those who can benefit from this strategy, to be implemented and therefore to be set forth in this decision. A further point on which the European Parliament has insisted – and rightly so – is the involvement, association and participation of the local and regional levels in implementing the employment strategy. We know how important the role of the local and regional authorities is in promoting employment and high-quality employment, particularly for those people for whom it is most difficult to penetrate or re-enter the world of work – women, young people, people with disabilities, older workers – for they can involve all the social operators present on the territory and create favourable conditions for employment. To this end, I feel it is absolutely essential to introduce activities relating to awareness-building, best practice, cooperation and exchange of experiences. The partnership, which has already been used to implement other initiatives and has proved to be an extraordinary, effective involvement tool, must become a traditional, standard method of working in the field of employment too.

 Mr President, Nigeria has ratified a number of international conventions on human rights, in particular the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. Despite this, however, here we are once again discussing the violation of women’s rights, pointing out that the death penalty still exists in Nigeria, declaring that current practice and the countless regulations contained in the new codes of criminal procedure of the Sharia 
continue to further the severe violation of human rights, even to the point of enforcing the death penalty. We, together with many men and women of democratic countries, have roused ourselves to action, and that is what saved the lives of Safiya and of Hafsatu, but, despite this victory, the Islamic court in Bakori has condemned another woman, Mrs Amina Lawal, to being stoned to death. Now, I do not feel we can continue – although we must do so – to discuss these massacres. We must demand that Nigeria, which is preparing for democratic elections and must therefore be supported by the European Union, not merely – as has been mentioned in the context of the Cotonou Agreement – consolidate pluralist democracy and social and economic justice, but that it put an end to these violations too. I feel that we can no longer be content with just discussing the ongoing violations and waiting for something to happen. We must be more resolute and take action using all the tools available to us.

 Mr President, as the rapporteur has made quite clear, this directive does not require us to debate the hazardous nature of asbestos but to start from the certainty of that fact. Although further scientific research is necessary to completely clear up the remaining doubts regarding the risks of asbestos exposure to human health, the number of victims of asbestos-related diseases in Europe is such that the majority of the Member States have implemented the ban on the marketing and use of products containing asbestos. The problem is now also responding to the shift of asbestos-related risks from one sector to another: from the traditional risks in the production sector – which, although significant, are controllable – to the risks in the sectors in which asbestos has to be handled because removal, maintenance, repair, or demolition work is carried out. The latter are potentially high, predictable risks, with regard to which it is becoming essential to base proposals squarely on the precautionary principle when setting exposure limits. Furthermore, the risks posed by asbestos extend beyond the workers directly exposed to it. Others, such as the families of workers and persons living near work sites, may also be at risk, albeit to a much lesser extent, namely the families of workers and persons living near work sites. Although Italy is fortunate in that its legislation is more advanced than the proposed rules, it is important that we support the rapporteur now and adopt the report, for we need to make it absolutely clear that standards of safety at the workplace cannot be lowered. We must never forget that a high level of competitiveness is based partly on high quality social conditions and that quality of work is an important production factor. In conclusion, over and above the general political considerations mentioned, which, as we socialists see it, cannot be ignored, we must remember that the internationalisation of the economic and social costs of occupational diseases, both those already diagnosed and those still to be so, as well as accidents at work, should convince everybody beyond any doubt that high standards of health and safety in the workplace are, in addition to being a right of the workers, also beneficial to the companies themselves and to the economy in general.

 Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, on her presentation of this report to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and on her extremely detailed work. We know that Europe is one of the most prosperous continents in the world but, despite that, a substantial number of our citizens live in conditions of extreme poverty and social marginalisation. One of the parameters for measuring these conditions, in addition to income, is, without a doubt, illiteracy, for illiteracy is a cause of exclusion and prevents access to human rights, as the rapporteur rightly said in her report. Illiteracy, understood to mean either a lack of basic education or ‘returning’ illiteracy, is causing an increasing divide between those who are privileged and enjoy relative security and those who are disadvantaged and marginalised, who do not have access to work, who are in danger of isolation and do not participate in social life. Illiteracy also represents an expense, a cost both for businesses and in social terms, as well as a cause of exclusion. It is an ongoing problem in Europe, although it is not thought of as a cost, but there are no reliable data available for analysis. Combating illiteracy and social marginalisation is now essentially the responsibility of the Member States, but at the Lisbon Summit – as has already been said – the Heads of State and Government set themselves the goal of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, etc, etc. Moreover, the European Social Agenda was adopted at Nice. Therefore, combating illiteracy and marginalisation must become one of the priorities of the Union and the Member States, with all the relevant policies applied in the context of a global, integrated strategy. We therefore firmly support the rapporteur’s calls for a Green Paper and an Action Plan. I will not go into their contents because they are already outlined in the report. However, we do call strongly upon the Commission to promote these texts: Parliament will support them and stand shoulder to shoulder with the Commission to ensure the Council endorses them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, as the previous speakers have already said, the situation in Eritrea is becoming increasingly serious as far democracy is concerned. The Eritrean Parliament, which is made up of elected members who all belong to the People’s Front for Democracy and Justice, has decided to ban the formation of political parties. The independent press has been suppressed and many journalists, politicians and political opponents, including former government ministers, have been arrested, accused of treason against the national assembly. There is an increase in repressive measures being taken to control the citizens, especially students, two of whom died while imprisoned in the desert. The Italian ambassador has been expelled. The state of the economy and of citizens’ living conditions is becoming increasingly serious. The non-governmental organisations operating in Eritrea report situations which have reached hitherto unknown severity: even doctors, nurses and paramedics have been removed from hospitals and sent to the front, leaving the people with no health care at all. The violence inflicted on the people, particularly women and children, is indescribable. The international community cannot just stand by and watch. We need to intervene as swiftly as possible to help define the borders. The UN Security Council and the Algiers Commission have committed themselves to doing this, but we need a European delegation, a troika, to go to Eritrea and we need to reassess relations with this country on the basis of the Cotonou agreements. We need to demand the announcement of parliamentary elections – already scheduled, moreover, for December 2001 – elections which must take place under international supervision. We must demand the release of all political prisoners, and that the freedom of the press, the freedom of association, the freedom to develop society and the freedom to form political parties and trade unions be restored. All this must be an essential prerequisite if the Union is to resume the financing which is absolutely vital for the reconstruction of the country’s war-torn economy and for its development. The Council and the Member States need to adopt a coordinated approach to relations with Eritrea which is as effective as possible and such as to contribute quickly to the process of achieving peace at the country’s borders and within Eritrea. The ACP/EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly will take place as of mid-March. We hope that, at that forum, we will be able to debate the processes announced previously as having already taken place, and that we will be able to find a way to initiate a peace process with the Eritreans as well, to restore democracy and, most importantly, to restore to the citizens, men, women and children acceptable living conditions which are no longer shameful.

 Mr President, today’s debate and tomorrow’s vote in the Chamber mark the end of a long, difficult path which the three institutions have been following for some years, conducting a frank, heated debate on a subject of major importance: the information, consultation and participation of workers. With conciliation, which was concluded satisfactorily on 17 December last, the European Union defined minimum information and consultation standards to be applied throughout Union territory. Thus, after the directives on European Works Councils, the European Company Statute and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, this directive completes the existing Community and national frameworks, which can help to ensure that necessary preparations are made for the change, that restructuring is carried out in an acceptable context and that the ‘employment’ objective is given the necessary priority in the current situation. It seems to me particularly significant that agreement has been reached before the Barcelona Summit. Almost all the Member States have a legal framework in place – either statutory or contractual in origin – which seeks to ensure that workers are informed and consulted: almost all, I said, but not all, and this directive extends the right so that it exists throughout the Union. Basically, this directive recognises the rights of workers and their representatives in all undertakings with less than 50 employees to be informed and consulted about all aspects of the life of the undertaking, particularly the implications of company choices on employment, the organisation of work, training and skill development. It is important that the directive should focus on the content and procedures, including time frames, for informing and consulting workers. It explicitly lays down that information and consultation must be timely, for that is a prerequisite for the success of the restructuring and adaptation processes of undertakings and of processes identifying anticipatory measures necessary to offset negative impact on workers. It recognises a number of rights of workers’ representatives and of workers themselves; it lays down sanctions that the Member States have to introduce into their own legislation – when implementing and applying the directive – effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. I feel that this is a particularly important point and it has been the subject of much debate. The Commission’s initial plan, supported by Parliament, was to lay down a European sanction. However, in respect for the principle of subsidiarity, the directive stipulates that the Member States themselves should introduce sanctions. A transitional period is also laid down for those States which do not yet have any statutory system – either legal or contractual – although it is shorter than that provided for in the common position. Clearly, the European Parliament would have liked more: it would have liked more specific information, clearer definition and more content, but considering the sensitivity of the subject and the resistance in recent months from both governments and lobbies, I feel that we can consider ourselves satisfied with the result. The Parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee voted unanimously for this agreement. We can be satisfied because rights are recognised, the social dialogue is given due importance and the principle of subsidiarity is respected while a uniform framework is defined for the entire territory of the Union: there will no longer be A class workers and B class workers when it comes to the rights recognised in undertakings. I want to end by thanking, in particular, the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, and her staff, the Belgian Presidency and Mrs Onkelinx. I would point out that we were three women, the three of us, in particular, working on this directive. I feel that it was our determination and our strong awareness of the major importance of the subject, not least – supported as we were, I by my committee and Parliament and the Commissioner and the Minister by their convictions – which enabled us to bring such a vital process to a conclusion. In my opinion, the Barcelona Summit will be a good opportunity for us to see whether our conclusions have a positive, practical impact.

 Mr President, the information, consultation and participation of employees assumed primary importance in the European debate as far back as 1974, when the first social action programme was adopted by the Council. Since then, the issue has featured in many of our debates in this Chamber and the Commission has launched a large number of initiatives, which have met with resistance. Almost all the Member States have a legislative or contractual legal framework in place intended to guarantee the information and consultation of employees. This directive proposes the introduction of minimum information and consultation standards which would be implemented throughout Union territory: after the European Company Statute, the European Works Council Directive and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the directive before us today completes the existing Community and national frameworks, thus contributing to the ultimate purpose of the law in question which is to ensure that adequate preparations are made for the change, that restructuring takes place under acceptable conditions and that due importance is given to the employment objective in the current situation. The Commission presented its proposal – a sound proposal – in November 1998, and the European Parliament concluded its first reading in April 1999, adopting a series of amendments to improve it. Only in June 2001 did the Council adopt a common position. In general terms, the common position reflects the position adopted by the Commission following Parliament’s first reading but, if we compare the first reading of the European Parliament with the common position, we see that thirty or so of the amendments made by Parliament were not actually accepted. As rapporteur, I called upon the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs not to repropose all the amendments adopted at first reading but concentrate on the most important points in order to improve the common position. My colleagues – whom I would like to thank for their cooperation – put forward 15 amendments to my proposal, almost all of which serve to reinforce it. After an in-depth debate, we came up with the text on which the House is to vote today. There are 16 amendments and they concern: the procedures for consulting employees, and these are in line with the common position but more specific in identifying problems; the definition of economic and financial information; the exact definition of ‘social partners’, in order to avoid ambiguities; the protection of employees’ representatives, which needs to be better defined in terms of protection against disadvantage with regard to career, wage and training
; suspension of decisions which could result in substantial negative consequences for employees, so that the taking of a final decision can be deferred for a suitable period at the request of employees’ representatives in order to allow time for further negotiation and for a solution acceptable to all parties to be found. Transitional periods: this is an extremely sensitive point. We do not feel that specific transitional periods are necessary. Precisely because this directive introduces minimum standard 
rights, it must be enforced for all European employees simultaneously. The question of penalties is the most sensitive point. It has provoked a deluge of lobbies from all sides of the House. We have decided not to include our initial suggestion of a European penalty with legal effect in our proposal, but we have reinforced the common position, stipulating that it should be the Member States that, whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity, introduce more stringent penalties for serious violations which impact upon employees. This is an interpretation of the common position, which states that the Member States must lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. It is my genuine hope that this House will confirm the wide majority reached in committee and will lose no time in providing the Union and the Member States with this major legislative instrument during the Belgian Presidency.

 Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, for her willingness to take into account the considerations and the work of all the political groups. The report she is tabling today and upon which we are to vote tomorrow shows that Parliament has focused on the most important points, which will improve the common position, in order to achieve the adoption of the amendments to the directive with all speed. Although the common position recognised Parliament’s position at first reading on a precise definition of direct and indirect discrimination – which we welcome – we feel that it is necessary – and this is an important amendment – to provide precise definitions of harassment, sexual harassment and the procedures for combating it, including preventive measures. We also feel that it is important to keep our amendment reducing the derogations provided for by the Commission and the Council in respect of the implementation of the directive, and that it is necessary to reinforce protection of maternity and paternity rights, including in cases of adoption, providing effective safeguards against discrimination against parents using the rights they are entitled to.
 There is one point which I am sure will be discussed in conciliation, for the Commission too expressed reservations regarding this point in its amended position, and it is the provision for positive measures laying down specific advantages. We felt that it was important to include them because that consolidates the provisions of the Treaty. Another important point which we feel should still be included is the laying down of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, leaving it to the Member States to identify procedures, an issue which we have also addressed in other debates in this very Chamber and which we endorsed with the vote on the report on information and consultation. Moreover, it is necessary to make clear, as we have done, the concept of protection for victims, the extension of this protection to trade union representatives and the need for the bodies created to apply the principle of equality to be provided with adequate resources so that they can lend appropriate legal and other assistance to the victims of gender discrimination. We must also clarify the provision made for 
collective action to be brought in the event of breaches of the directive and the requirement for employees to draw up equal opportunities plans. The Socialist Group will vote for all the amendments adopted in committee. Regrettably, however, I have to tell the rapporteur that we do not support the two amendments she tabled together with the Liberals and the GUE, not so much as regards the content as because we feel they do not achieve anything substantial in legislative terms and, on the contrary, inappropriately go against the compromise reached, which I hope will be confirmed tomorrow with a very wide majority in this House to give us more power in conciliation.

 Madam President, I would like to thank you for mentioning at the start of the sitting the tragedy which took place at Milan Linate airport, which claimed 118 lives. Investigations are currently being carried out into who is responsible. Of course, it became clear very early on that, while, regrettably, human error is always possible, it was made possible in this case largely by the severe lack of security in that airport, which we all believed to be safe. From the human point of view, I feel that it is becoming imperative that these errors are not repeated and that such a tragic incident should compel all those responsible to undertake solemnly to ensure that such tragedies are avoided in the future. As regards responsibility, I feel that we, as the European Union, should call upon the Commission and the Council to be more rigorous in enforcing the imperative need for airport security, to ensure that such tragedies are avoided in future.

 Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Prodi for having clarified in his speech certain points which, from a reading of the White Paper, could have given rise to misunderstandings. Today’s debate on governance is important because it aims at encouraging broader discussion on the meaning of European integration and its goals. It complements the debate on the future of the Union, and thus it should concentrate on the connection between general objectives and the concrete actions seen by the citizens. As we all know, what really lies at the basis of this deliberation is the realisation that the long-term credibility of European integration is undermined by the lack of mutual recognition between public structures and civil society. We must therefore involve numerous sections and expressions of civil society to the greatest extent possible, because in this way the citizens will also be playing a greater part in policy- and decision-making. This is an important task that the institutions of the European Union must all make a real effort to carry out together. To this end, I would recall that during the last Parliamentary term the European Parliament itself, and in particular the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, recognised the need to initiate and formalise a dialogue with civil society. To do this an effort must be made to identify the most representative groups, so as to avoid an excess of consultations and overlapping. We therefore ask for an Interinstitutional Agreement on this, which will lead to a division of labour and, at the same time, collaboration between Commission, Parliament and Council. A second important point, which has already been hinted at, is the need to simplify Community legislative procedures, distinguishing, that is, between political and legislative decisions, which must not become detailed technical instruments; and distinguishing between Parliament’s prerogatives and competences that belong to the executive. Something that you, Mr Prodi, have mentioned is therefore important: the need to specify a call-back mechanism for secondary legislation which can safeguard and strengthen the role of the European Parliament. (Applause)

 Madam President, I would like to go back to Mr Berlusconi’s statements, not least because it is an issue which extends beyond Italian concern, as is indicated by the reactions of all the Heads of State and Government to these statements. I have to say, Madam President, that we Italians – or at least the majority of the Italians sitting in this House – are particularly concerned by Mr Berlucsoni’s statements because these statements, in addition to being in blatant conflict with the conclusions of the Brussels European Council, subscribed to by Mr Berlusconi himself, moreover, reflect the attitude – which I hope has ceased to prevail – of part of the majority supporting the Italian government. In matters such as these which, regrettably, can carry such weight as to tip the balance towards war or peace, exploitation for political ends is unacceptable; however, equally unacceptable are superficial expressions which, I am sad to say, appear to mask attitudes of intolerance which must be opposed. Without wishing to exacerbate the issue, we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that, after 11 September, a major government coalition party held public demonstrations with boards saying ‘Immigrants = terrorists’, and that, in recent days, two mayors of cities in Northern Italy from the same party have ordered the closure of the premises used as mosques. That, Madam President, is why we will feel more reassured if you too, as President of this Parliament, particularly following Mr Santini’s words, were to confirm a clear message of open dialogue, such as Parliament has already had occasion to send to the Muslim Arab communities and countries with which we intend to work to combat terrorism, together, openly and resolutely.

 Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Smet on this own-initiative report and on the thorough, comprehensive document before us. The wage gap between men and women is a well-known phenomenon which is present in all the States of the Union, although in different proportions, and the issue has been on our agendas for a long time now. Previous speakers have mentioned the World Labour Organisation Convention of 1951, the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, the 1995 directive and the Treaty of Amsterdam. A great deal has been done, including in terms of the measures to be taken. The Commission has been presenting recommendations for over 10 years now, sometimes at Parliament’s request; I also remember the code of conduct prepared by the Commission which sought to raise awareness in the Member States and the two sides of industry in order to take practical action in this field. Although the information is still not complete, analysis of the phenomenon allows us to understand the reasons for the existence of the differentials. There are structural reasons, which have been recorded, such as age, training, seniority, and precarious and part-time work, in which mainly women are employed. However, there is also genuine discrimination, direct discrimination – in some cases there is unequal pay for equal work – but, above all, value discrimination: women’s work is still considered to be of less value than men’s, even when they have the same qualifications and responsibilities. Here is an example from my country: it was only in the mid-1980’s, after 15 years of campaigning, that a pay rise was at last obtained in the textile workers’ pay agreement 
for the category of workers ‘packing supervisor’, which exists in the textiles sector. This only happened, that is, when women lost their jobs during restructuring in this profession, which had been a typically female profession, and men began to be employed as well. I feel that this is a tangible example of an issue which was only resolved in Italy in the mid-80s and which still remains unresolved today in a great many other situations. The rapporteur has made numerous proposals and, in my opinion, we should follow her recommendations. The Commissioner and the Commission are very open to such proposals and the employment guidelines for 2002 make this a priority too.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Menrad for his thorough work in drawing up this report, including the hearings he organised together with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in order to examine closely the incorporation of the directive into national legal systems. This study shows, without a doubt, that the incorporation of the directive into national legal systems is, for the most part, having positive results and that European works councils have been set up in around 2000 European companies. In many companies, the directive has contributed to eliminating the barriers to information and consultation. What is more, the timely participation of the Company committees in some of the decision-making processes has certainly yielded positive results, first and foremost for the workers in areas such as health, safety and equal opportunities but also for the companies in that the number of disputes has fallen. Having said that, the Menrad report – which we support – also reveals a series of gaps in the directive itself, and I consider it absolutely essential that the Commission takes measures to amend the directive to deal with these gaps without delay. I would, in particular, like to focus on three elements which, in addition to those cited by other Members, I feel are the most sensitive points and those which require swift action to be taken. Firstly, the information timeframe: there is no clear stipulation in the directive regarding the timely provision of information and, in recent years – we have often discussed the matter in this House – we have adopted resolutions but have, I regret to say, had a great deal of negative incidents such as workers learning of their fate from the press or being presented with a final decision by companies. In this regard, we could cite cases such as Ahlston
, Adb
, Marks and Spencer
 and many others. Well then, if this is the case, it is necessary, absolutely essential for the directive to be more precise, for it to lay down timeframes which ensure that information is provided and consultation carried out before any decision is taken, to provide a real opportunity for negotiation, otherwise it will serve no purpose at all! Secondly, I am sure the Members will agree with me when I say that there are no rules in a legal system which, if disregarded, lose their effect. It is strange that it is only in the area of work and social rights that this is almost the norm! There have thus been many disputes and incidents of recourse to industrial tribunals in recent years, precisely because the failure of companies to respect the stipulations of the directive does not on any account place in question the validity of the effects of the decision taken and certainly does not do so automatically. It is therefore necessary for appropriate, dissuasive penalties to be laid down and, similarly, in serious cases of breach of the directive, it is necessary to provide for the suspension of a decision in order to allow negotiations to continue.

 Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, for her thorough work and for her willingness to take into account all the contributions and suggestions that all the political groups made on such a delicate matter. The last speech showed how intense the discussion within the Committee on Women’s Rights was, because it is quite true that the 1976 directive played a remarkable role, but 25 years have passed and both social behaviour and the role of women have changed. Behind us we have numerous decisions of the Court of Justice but, most importantly, we have the Treaty of Amsterdam which, from the legal standpoint, gives us the opportunity to consolidate and make more effective the legal instruments which, as we are quite aware, are instruments, but vital instruments for implementing active policies and for putting the principle of equal opportunities into practice, even as regards access to employment. The temptation to try to use this amendment to the directive to tackle many of the problems facing women has been great – in this respect Mrs Lulling is right – but I believe that the result of our labours is, from a legal standpoint, absolutely consistent with the proposals and objectives of the draft amendment that the Commission presented to us. I believe the definitions of ‘direct discrimination’ and ‘indirect discrimination’ which we have taken from the Commission proposal and improved upon are such as to make the use of this instrument clear at a legal level. The inclusion of harassment and sexual harassment as elements of discrimination is, without a shadow of a doubt, equally clear, as is also the clarification that the right to maternity, like the right to paternity, cannot be used as an instrument for enforcing discrimination. The possibility of putting into practice positive actions like, indeed, the possibility given to us by Article 141(4) of the Treaty, is, I believe, an equally clear instrument, so that the directive – which I hope will be operational by the end of this year and will be an instrument at the service of all the Member States, all women, all organisations – may truly become one more instrument added to those that the European Union has for all these years placed at the service of so many Member States. Somebody raised the point that the European Union might interfere more than it should do under the principle of subsidiarity. Well, in my opinion, not even this could ever be used as an excuse by anybody, because the legal instruments that can be adopted are specified here and in some cases there are obligations associated with them and in others opportunities, depending on the laws of the Member States. But I believe and hope that, today, the House will, by a large majority, approve Mrs Hautala’s proposal, which has the consensus of the overwhelming majority of the Committee on Women’s Rights, because I feel that this, too, will be a step forwards in making one of the basic principles of our Community – the principle of equal opportunities – become a reality.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I was pleased to hear that for the next Council the Commission intends to insist that the Council assume its responsibilities with regard to the directive on employees’ rights to information and consultation. As several Members have already pointed out, it is now three years since Parliament gave it its first reading. In these three years we have several times in this House debated problems of redundancies, mergers and company relocations, but the Council has never assumed any responsibility, has never had the courage to face up to this subject and make a decision, adding something to the laws and other instruments that the Union has and can use to strengthen its own intervention regarding companies’ social responsibilities. Now it seems that some countries have dropped their reservations, and so the conditions are right for the next Council to take up a position. The information and consultation problem is one that has something to do with the possibility of intervening in a preventive manner so that the consequences of unilateral company decisions are not such that they place jobs, working conditions or the living conditions of workers at risk. For this to happen, however, it is necessary to reach a precise agreement, and Parliament’s positions from this point of view were highly specific even at first reading on the methods, times and content of consultations and information. In addition – and I am pleased that the Commission has remembered this – there is a fundamental instrument which, paradoxically, is regarded as a fundamental element in all laws except those concerning workers, i.e. that of penalties. There is no law on any subject that does not lay down penalties for breach of the law. Only in the case of workers’ rights does this still not happen in Europe. The directive on the right to information and consultation does lay down sanctions, and I am pleased that the Commission is maintaining this position. Parliament not only upholds the Commission’s position but supports the Commission in its position and I believe this matter of penalties will not only be confirmed in the Council’s positions on the directive but will extend to other legislation as well – works councils, mass redundancies – otherwise without a penalty instrument all these laws too will be less effective than we would like them to be.

 Mr President, I am happy to say that the remaining two hostages, two humanitarian workers, British citizens, were released yesterday. They had been captured on 27 March last together with a further seven westerners and a Somali by the warlord Musse Sudi Yalahow. Of course, we are reassured by their release, but it does not diminish our concern at the failure to respect human rights and our condemnation of the continued acts of violence and banditry perpetrated by the armed militia in Somalia. It is vital that the temporary Somali Government does everything possible to initiate constructive dialogue working towards peace, stability and national reconciliation with all the parties involved, Somali community leaders and the authorities of Somaliland and Puntland. We all need to renounce the use of arms in order to be able to address the country's serious political, social and economic problems, so that all the parties tackle the issues of the management of aid, education, health and the economy together. The donor countries must all step up humanitarian aid and cooperation activities, ensure that the embargo on arms is fully respected and require all the parties concerned to cooperate to re-establish peace. The European Union, in particular, must provide all the financial and technical assistance necessary to guarantee the success of the peace initiative of the Intergovernmental Development Authority and Djibouti, but, in particular, it must, as it did in the case of the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, undertake a coherent political initiative and speak with one voice to promote dialogue and negotiation to resolve the country's most urgent problems. Civil society, the local communities and the non-governmental organisations, which are fighting for national reconciliation and peace, must be supported. We must disband the armed groups which have caused the death of at least 20 civilians in recent weeks and step up mine-clearance operations. We must also show our complete solidarity with and support for the organisation "Médecins sans frontières", which, as I said, was attacked on 27 March last.

 Mr President, in her speech before the House this morning, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel expressed her amazement and alarm at the frequency with which this issue comes up in this House, and wondered why this is. I too am amazed at how often it crops up. We are concerned at the tragic implications of industrial restructuring and mergers – of which the workers are all too often only informed at the last minute when all the decisions have been made – for unemployment, working conditions, the very competitiveness of Community businesses and economic cohesion, and we appeal to companies' sense of responsibility and express our sympathy, but then we do not follow the cases up. Community legislation does not go far enough and, what is more, in many cases it is disregarded or applied too leniently. I could produce a long list, as many Members have done, of relevant cases which we have discussed in recent years. One of the objectives set by the Lisbon Council was to achieve a high level of high quality employment. How can we achieve a Europe which is both competitive and has a high level of high quality employment? Of course, this can be accomplished by improving coordination and the play of balance between the Union's different policies, but there is no doubt that the Community legislation on the subject needs to be more effective and more stringent. Therefore, we can wait no longer – and here the Commission must assume its responsibilities – for a revision of the directive on European works councils, mass redundancies and relocation of enterprises, which does not make specific provision for a system of effective penalties for failure to comply. But what really appals me – and here I refer to the Council in particular – is that it is already two years since Parliament expressed its opinion at the first reading of the only instrument which would allow us to deal effectively with these issues, the information and consultation directive, and in these two years, despite the general agreement that dialogue is the best way to deal with problems, the Council has not yet been able to summon up the courage or the strength to adopt a position on the matter. Parliament can no longer tolerate such behaviour.

 Mr President, as many Members have said, speaking on ‘Plan Columbia’, this United States military plan, the European Union must intervene autonomously and independently, pursuing a non-military strategy, promoting and safeguarding respect for human rights, humanitarian law and fundamental freedoms and, most importantly, doing something to improve the standard of living of the local communities. On several occasions, including in recent months, we have drawn up resolutions on human rights in Columbia, resolutions adopted in this Chamber. Well then, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this debate to condemn another incident: since 15 September 2000, three Italian citizens, engineers employed by a company which makes sweet-making machines, have been in the hands of the National Liberation Army. Together with these three Italian citizens, there are three other Europeans and thousands of Colombians. Not only have they been held prisoner for four months, it has not been possible to communicate with them at all. The Italian authorities are doing everything in their power but there is a certain unwillingness, even on the part of the Colombian Government, to undertake serious negotiations with the National Liberation Army in order to reach a solution. Now, I feel that we must make human rights our priority, and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to ask the President of Parliament to send a letter to the Colombian authorities calling for respect for human rights and urging the government to make every endeavour to ensure, since it says that it is negotiating with the Liberation Army and the other forces, that any agreement reached will, without fail, include the immediate liberation of all the European and Colombian citizens – both Europeans and non-Europeans – who are deprived of their freedom and are prisoners of the militaries.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the floods which have affected various areas of northern Italy and other European countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland and France in recent weeks once again raise the issue for Parliament both of an extraordinary, urgent intervention to alleviate the distress of the people, communities and companies affected, and a longer term policy to prevent the repetition of natural disasters of this scale. Certain regions of Italy have suffered particularly badly for the second time in less than a month. The damage is considerable this time as well, people have died and the material damage has been enormous. In Liguria, in particular, entire plantations of specialised flower and fruit and vegetable crops have been destroyed and there has been a great deal of damage to seaside resorts, civil engineering works and factories, caused by storm surges as well as the floods. And given the remarkable scale of the disaster, the request made in the resolution which we tabled together with other groups is totally justified, despite the fact that these issues have been debated recently in this House – on 26 October to be precise – and that a Parliamentary resolution was adopted on that occasion as well. We call upon the Commission to set aside part of its budget for emergency funds, so as to incorporate the interventions envisaged by the national authorities in the areas affected, and, pursuant to Article 87(2) of the Treaty on European Union, immediately to grant fitting financial assistance to the sectors affected by the disasters and, in general, to take into consideration the fact that the majority of the disaster areas are eligible for assistance from the existing funds: the Regional Fund, the EAGGF Guarantee Fund and the LIFE programme, which can provide a genuinely substantial contribution to the reconstruction work and restore the normal lives of the peoples who have been the victims of these disasters as soon as possible, but, above all, which can contribute to preventing further such damage. It is vital that the Union does not restrict itself to making one-off interventions after disasters have occurred. Europe must remind the Member States to update their legislation on the environment, construction abuse, reforestation and the promotion of farming methods which seek not only to increase production quantities, but also to protect and replenish the land. Clearly, such large-scale action cannot be developed effectively at national level alone, due, primarily, to the amount of resources necessary but also because of the very nature of the natural disasters in question which, like those resulting from climate change, certainly have no respect for borders. With this resolution, we call for an urgent intervention contributing to repairing the damage and also for a longer-term policy to make Europe an increasingly safe and accommodating region for its citizens to live in.

 Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and Mrs Péry on this presentation of the social agenda. I consider the social policy agenda to be an extremely important political document which identifies instruments, sectors of intervention and timeframes and guarantees positive, dynamic interaction between economic, social and employment policies. These instruments are intended to adapt the European social model in line with the changing reality. I fully support Mrs Van Lancker's report and I would like, in particular, to stress a point which has, moreover, already been raised by both the rapporteur and Mrs Péry in their speeches, and that is the need for all the instruments to be genuinely implemented at European level, and therefore for application of the open coordination method to go hand in hand with reinforcement of the legal dimension. This is what happens in many countries. In conclusion, I would like to give an example: last week, the Italian Parliament adopted a new law on welfare which was proposed by a Minister – a woman, like the three representatives of the three institutions. This is tantamount to a revolution, for the old law on welfare had been in force for over 100 years.

Mr President, I too would like to thank Minister Péry and Commissioner Diamantopoulou for today's debate. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, whose report not only contains observations on the situation of equal opportunities in the European Union, but also recommends a course of action. I would particularly like to thank the Minister for the work she is doing in her own country and as President-in-Office of the Council, and I would like to make a connection between the work of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the work of the Commission, focusing on one point: employment. The report before us is, I feel, a major synergistic work. The guidelines for 2001 on equal opportunities in the world of employment are starting to become better defined, more specific and more effective. This is the way forward. The Committee on Women's Rights would like to congratulate the Commission and also propose a few even more specific pointers. I truly believe that this report and the Fifth Action Programme which lays down a strategy are the way forward. We might do better to stop complaining, or rather to complain but, at the same time, to show due appreciation for the positive steps which are being taken to ensure that we make increasingly effective progress.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her thorough, responsible and unreserved report. This is an extremely sensitive issue which is closely related to other matters which are regularly referred to such as the ageing population, the demographic trend, the low birth rate, the right to health, the right to work, the right to motherhood and the social value of motherhood. This matter cannot be viewed as affecting women alone: they must be protected and supported by society. The 1992 directive, whose implementation in the Member States we are assessing today, is intended precisely to introduce minimum measures to encourage the improvement of the health and safety of pregnant women and women who have recently given birth and are breastfeeding. The Commission's evaluation report shows that the directive has proved its utility in that it has been of some benefit in a number of Member States in certain areas of the issue, such as leave on grounds of health and safety, etc. However, apart from these points, which are of a general nature, we share the rapporteur's criticism of the Commission's report. This report was overdue and limited almost exclusively to dealing with legal and technical transposition. There is a lack of concrete statistics and data on vital aspects of the directive, such as the monitoring of workplace risk assessment for pregnant workers and the frequency of work-related accidents and illnesses, and satisfactory information is not provided on the coordination of legislative adaptation of specialist inspection, penalties or scientific research for the detection, prevention, elimination and recuperation of professional hazards relating to pregnancy. We feel that there has been a lack of serious monitoring on the part of the Commission. There has been a lack of coordination between the health and safety directorate and the equal opportunities unit, and the ambiguity of the directive itself in this area has become apparent. The delay in the production of an evaluation report – and I would remind you that, precisely because of the low minimum standards set, Italy was only persuaded to approve the directive on the condition that its implementation would be monitored very soon afterwards – should have led the Commission to put forward a proposal to revise the directive, particularly in relation to certain aspects referred to by the rapporteur: the length of maternity leave, the increase in the duration of maternity leave where risks are involved, a more precise definition of the concept of an adequate allowance, the prohibition of dismissal of women during pregnancy or maternity leave with effective penalties, the prohibition of any form of discrimination with regard to women's careers or the improvement of working conditions, the implementation of all the measures necessary to safeguard the health and safety of woman and unborn child, without prejudice to the woman's right to work or her career and encouraging breastfeeding through diverse measures. In addition to taking all the necessary compatibilities into consideration, when they revise the directive, the Commission and the Member States should be motivated by the principle of non-discrimination and the recognition of motherhood and fatherhood as fundamental rights which are essential for a balanced society.

 Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists in support of Mr Pronk's words on behalf of the Committee as a whole. I have to say that I was not totally satisfied by the Commissioners' responses, in that the documents that were referred to, with which we are familiar, as Mr Pronk said, need to contain time frames and rather more practical decision.  As we know, we have been discussing the issue for years. Parliament has played a fundamental role in this dialogue, but it is now time to move on from dialogue and declarations to concrete action. The Commission needs to start putting forward practical solutions, for otherwise the issue will never be resolved. I can see a certain contradiction and I am concerned, and I believe I speak for the rest of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as well, that behaviour within the Commission in relation to the issue appears to be somewhat contradictory. The role of the non-governmental organisations in the democratic construction of the Union and the economic and social role they play in Europe, the entire social economy sector, the third sector, is now acknowledged in practice as well as in documents – if we consider that approximately nine million workers are employed in this sector – as a major sector of fundamental importance. Well, the most recent decisions of the Commission – and I refer to the Directorate-General for Industry – have labelled this a negative priority – they have now invented the concepts of positive and negative priorities – and have abolished the 'social economy' operative unit. In my opinion, this is extremely serious and leaves us extremely sceptical as to whether the declarations made repeatedly in this House, which we have heard on several occasions, will be followed by practical action in the right direction. The NGO platform, with which Parliament and the Commission have maintained dialogue, and all those involved feel as if they have been taken for a ride, and I think that we parliamentarians also feel rather as if we have been deceived, when declarations are made saying one thing and then, in reality, practical decisions lead to another.  The absence of an interlocutor on the administrative side apart from anything else will make it all the more difficult to resolve these problems rather than making it easier. So if we genuinely want to make positive progress, speed up the procedures and provide positive responses for the European citizens as well as the Non-Governmental Organisations, in my opinion, we need to rethink a whole series of decisions which have been taken and, most importantly, change them.

 Mr President, Mr Turco’s report, which recommends that Parliament accepts the proposal for an agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on the participation of Norway in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, was discussed at length and then unanimously adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. The amendments made by the Committee in agreement with the rapporteur, which have been incorporated into the proposal, are intended to exploit the opportunity presented by this agreement with Norway to give fresh impetus to the Centre’s work. The committee took into particular consideration the 1999 report on the Centre’s work and the difficulties encountered, and the outcome of the interinstitutional conference on drugs which took place in Brussels late last February. These sources showed that some of the constraints on the activities hitherto carried out by the Centre, which also restrict Union activity in this field, are caused by the wide range of differing information gathered by the various national centres linked to the Centre, with the result that it is difficult to draw conclusions from this information which would be useful in terms of prevention or damage limitation measures and operations to fight illegal trafficking. The various amendments, including those dealing with the Centre’s Management Board, are therefore intended to ensure that the Board uses genuinely effective data-gathering methods which are capable of interpreting the data in the light of unit criteria and provide useful indications regarding the efficiency of the various national anti-drugs policies. Indeed, it appeared to many members of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs that both the annual reports of the Centre and those tabled and adopted by Parliament fail to take into due account the analysis of the results obtained in the various countries, whose anti-drugs policies differ, moreover. The European Union needs to decide on its policies and recommendations to the governments of the Member States by means of a comprehensive assessment – which is not, as all too often happens, purely moralist – of the various strategies being followed in the various countries, especially with regard to prevention, damage limitation and consumer safety in the face of the constant emergence of new synthetic drugs.  We believe that the agreement on the participation of Norway in the work of the Centre, which, we hope, will pave the way for other enlargement initiatives, provides a major opportunity to revitalise the activity of this technical and scientific body, for the EMCDDA must become an increasingly important reference point in the development of a European policy to fight the illegal sale and distribution of drugs which are harmful to the health of the citizens of our countries.

 Mr President, I would also like to support the report presented by Mr Casaca on the European Commission proposal on the Integrated administration and control system for Community aid schemes, which was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control. In my opinion, the reservations expressed by the Executive, particularly the Commission’s position on Article 1 of the proposal, are unfounded. The products which the rapporteur intends to add to the list all fall within sectors of considerable financial consequence whose control mechanisms have proved to be insufficient. In fact, these products have all been subject to fraud and irregularity in the past. Moreover, the extension of this system to a greater number of products would facilitate sound, effective management, which would lead to simpler procedures for both the Executive and farmers. It is, in effect, necessary to harmonise the excessive number of different regulations which are currently in force, for the purposes of containing costs as well. On the basis of the above considerations, I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to incorporate the position of the Committee on Budgetary Control and, in particular, Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 2.

 Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency, in particular Minister Maria de Belém, and the Commission, represented by Commissioner Diamantopoulou, for their guidance and coordination work both at the preparatory stage and during the Conference, for this allowed the European Union to make a substantial contribution to the production of the final document.  It has already been said many times: the work carried out by the UN and in New York has demonstrated clearly that some progress has been made since Beijing. Women are no longer regarded as merely vulnerable people who need to be protected but as the social protagonists of change and as an essential part of society’s resources. The need to continue the fight against all forms of discrimination on grounds of gender, race, ethnic origin, religion, age, disability and sexual orientation, which are still rife throughout the world, has become clear. The need has become clear for governments to include a gender aspect in all government policies, from employment to development, from social policies to the fight against violence. There is an evident need to continue to step up dialogue and cooperation with autonomous women’s organisations in civil society, politics and the institutions. A number of challenges remain at national and international levels and for the European Union, particularly in the context of its development cooperation policy. In this regard, I would like to draw Commissioner Patten’s attention to the Commission’s frequently negligent attitude towards the adoption of drafts which provide for the involvement of women on development cooperation with Mediterranean countries. Poverty affects women more than anybody else. Therefore, we need to focus on clear policies which fight the social exclusion of women and consolidate their role as active protagonists of political change and economic development. If globalisation is to provide new opportunities, it must include globalisation of the human rights of all people, globalisation of fairness and globalisation of equal opportunities. Development must be regarded as a project to expand the freedoms which all human beings have the right to enjoy. Therefore, the need for recognition of rights without any discrimination must be a priority both for us and for the international organisations.

 Mr President, if we are to discuss trafficking in women, we have to be aware that we are talking about a form of slavery, a modern form of slavery in which the majority of the victims are women subjected to trafficking run by organised crime networks.  Trafficking in human beings supplies various markets: the market in organs for medical transplants, the market in new-born babies for those who do not have any children and the sweatshop market. However, the greatest area of crime involves women, the majority of whom are victims of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The poverty and marginalisation of the women in their countries of origin, the high earnings guaranteed to traffickers and the low risks they incur, and the substantial demand for women for prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation are the factors behind the growth of this trade.  The Tampere European Council recently charged the European Union to fight against illegal immigration and, amongst other things, against those who profit from the trafficking in human beings. Mrs Sörensen’s report goes beyond this perspective and gives absolute priority to the fight against trafficking in human beings. It is estimated that 500 000 women are trafficked every year, the majority of whom then work illegally, but the underground nature of the trade means that the true extent of the problem is unknown. The contribution of non-governmental organisations in revealing the causes, methods and consequences of the trafficking in women for sexual exploitation, and the support they provide for the victims, has brought about greater awareness of these issues.  The STOP and DAPHNE programmes already represent a major contribution of the European Union, but we must not stop there. Mrs Sörensen’s excellent report stresses the links between the trafficking in human beings and the policy on immigration and asylum, and calls, in the first place, upon the Intergovernmental Conference to bring about integral communitarisation of European policy in this field. As the report requests, it will therefore be necessary to establish a legal framework and effective prevention, protection and victim support measures at European level. On the other hand, the Member States and candidate countries must intervene themselves at legislative, administrative and police levels in order to eliminate this crime and, at the same time, increase international cooperation with Europol and Interpol to fight criminal networks.  At national level, refugee status must be granted to the victims of trafficking and they must be issued with residence permits. Some countries – Italy and Belgium – assisted by NGOs, have already introduced some early measures. Furthermore, information campaigns must be launched in the victims’ countries of origin and an awareness action pursued in the Member States to raise public awareness, in particular, among the male population.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, there has already been a great deal of discussion, and I hope that I will not repeat any of what has gone before. I would, however, like to thank the Portuguese Presidency most heartily for the document presented and for the excellent address given by the President-in-Office of the Council.  As President Guterres reminded us, it is true that we do not intend to introduce new processes in Lisbon, but rather to combine those decided upon in Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne. However, this is the first time in many years that a strategic objective has been put forward, and I feel that it is extremely important: to transform the Union into an economic area based on innovation and knowledge, in order to boost economic growth, achieve full employment in proper jobs and bring about social cohesion. Last year, the Commission carried out a study which revealed that, if we do not make radical changes to the qualification and professional training systems, by the year 2010, the skills of 80% of those currently in employment will be outdated, and this will exacerbate existing inequalities and open up new gulfs. The answer is lifelong learning and a large-scale investment in technical skills and knowledge. The amount of research – another strategic sector – which is carried out in the Member States of Europe must also increase. We must take a qualitative step forwards and move on from framework programmes to a European research area and a common research policy. This is innovation, and not just structural, technological innovation but also innovation in the field of procedures and methods. As Mr Van Lancker has already said, the “Social Affairs” Council must have the same status as the ECOFIN Council. Social dialogue must then be consolidated as a fundamental means of reaching a consensus on the implementation of the necessary changes. Lisbon must be remembered, not only for its excellent preparatory document, but as a Summit which, at the start of the new millennium, will mark a significant turnaround for economic growth, employment and social cohesion in Europe.

 I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today. The presence of women in decision-making bodies, in particular, is a question of democracy. All citizens, both men and women, should be able to see, to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule. If we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision-making bodies, it is clear that we are still far from true democracy. However, it is also a question of political agendas. In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model. Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan, where I live, 90% said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day. Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men. The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time. If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point. Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women. Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe, but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation. I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere – the entire European political sphere – to represent women and men on an equal footing, and for decisive action to be taken in this matter.

 Mr President, Commissioner, as the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we have tabled a compromise resolution together with the other groups of the left, the Greens and the GUE as we wanted to highlight and condemn the more striking, negative aspects of the behaviour of the companies discussed in the resolution, ABB-Alsthom and Goodyear Dunlop. The Goodyear case is not localised and limited to the industry in question: it concerns a thousand families who have lost their jobs overnight, and are left without income or prospects for the future. The cases we are discussing today, like many others we have discussed here – and I fear they will not be the last – as you, Commissioner, reminded us, provide us with the opportunity to discuss the imperative need to supplement European legislation. An example is the directive on the information and consultation of workers which you mentioned, that has been awaiting a solution for years and upon which the European Parliament gave its opinion very clearly in April last year. I am also referring to the importance of reinforcing European legislation across the board by revising existing directives. I believe that the European Union and the Commission must ask the Council and the Member States to consider the procedures for implementing these directives in the different States as well.   Italy is no exception – it is not one of the most advanced states when it comes to implementing directives – but there are many countries where the directives, which, in any case, only lay down minimum rights, are hardly implemented at all. This makes it possible for companies to relocate, even within the European Union, from one country to another where directives are less strictly applied, companies have greater benefits and workers are less well protected. And the result of this is social dumping.  Therefore, we must keep tabs on the application of these directives and reinforce European coordination. All this confirms our conviction that something like sanctions, which we reiterated were very important when we gave our opinion on the information and consultation directive last year, can on no account be abandoned. Otherwise, I believe that the cases we are discussing today will multiply constantly, and that, one day, the European Union will have no control over them, particularly with regard to competition and change-inducing technologies, and this will contribute to higher unemployment and weaken social cohesion.

 Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow.  In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible.  We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible.

Mr President, I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants, which we have always considered to be a priority, and inform you that – as the Italian delegation of the group – in response to the invitation from the group leader, Mr Barón Crespo, we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the Quaestors.  I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway. I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise.

 Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, has already pointed out, we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to 
the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations.  As we have heard, the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas, bearing in mind that 80% of the population of Europe lives in cities.  Creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation, action to combat poverty, measures to assist low-income groups and old people, facilities for children, racial and ethnic integration, better opportunities for participation, a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures. 
 The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic, social, and infrastructural measures. 
 However, we must remember that, in addition to URBAN, a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector: innovative actions under Article 6 of the ESF regulation, pilot projects, particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and mainstream ESF activities.  As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion, the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding.  While, on the one hand, we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary, we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved. Not only is this coordination essential but, as we stated in our opinion, exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential.

 Madam President, I shall speak for two minutes on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and for the other two minutes on behalf of the socialist group that I represent within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the EQUAL report. The EQUAL Community initiative, whose objective is to promote new practices and combat all forms of discrimination and inequality, has been discussed in detail by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities with regard to discrimination against women. This is because discrimination based on sex is structural and horizontal, and – given the fact that women are not a minority but represent more than half of the world population – the Committee on Women’s Rights is of the opinion that it might have been a mistake to include discrimination based on sex with all the other forms of discrimination. We believe that it should have been incorporated in a special Chapter of the Treaty devoted to Equal Opportunity between women and men. This would have been a logical consequence of the new central role given to equality between women and men in the Treaty.   Having said that, we nevertheless welcome the Commission’s proposals and feel that equality between women and men is to be promoted as an integral part of all four pillars of the employment strategy and thematic fields, and that equality should also be targeted specifically in a separate pillar. With regard to the EQUAL proposals, in the Community Initiative Programmes, there should be a clear distinction between priority actions aimed at combating gender discrimination and actions aimed at combating other kinds of discrimination. A gender-mainstreaming approach must be adopted by Member States, and they therefore need to put the emphasis on projects that not only aim to promote the fight against gender discrimination, but also facilitate reconciliation of work and family life.  In more general terms, there was a major debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on Mrs Stenzel’s report because the approach proposed by Mrs Stenzel and the one proposed by my group were very different.  Our assessment of the Commission’s proposal is very favourable, although we are trying – because the aim is for the European Parliament to express an opinion which will then have an influence on the Commission and Council’s assessments – to find solutions that might lead to a convergence of opinions, so that the report will be adopted by a broad majority.  Some issues were more sensitive than others: partnerships, for example, on which we need to reach a compromise in order to assert and support the Commission proposal. At the same time, we nevertheless need to ask the Commission for a certain amount of flexibility so that we can subsequently include other topics. Technical assistance and simplification must also be included among the fundamental points.  From a political point of view, the most sensitive issue was asylum-seekers. I would like to spend a few moments on this since we feel that the Commission’s proposal is considerate and positive. We have put a lot of time into coming up with a definition of ‘asylum-seeker’ because it is difficult from a legal point of view, but I think that we have now achieved a compromise with the rapporteur – at least I hope we have – and the silence on the report on asylum-seekers, which Parliament is going to put to the vote 
must be seen as Parliament supporting the Commission’s position.  We would never have accepted Parliament 
backing down 
– this is our position – from what the Commission has already proposed, and I am keen to stress this. I agree with the rapporteur that we should hold the vote on Wednesday, as she proposed, to allow more time to seek out every possible solution in order to hopefully make Parliament’s report more progressive, and not more backward-looking, than the Commission proposal.

 Mr President, in my intervention I would like to stress the fundamental role played by the European Parliament, and in particular, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, in, I hope, reaching the point where the final adoption of this programme will be debated. It has already been mentioned in other interventions that, a few years ago, the European Parliament promoted pilot projects supporting non-governmental organisations and local authorities that, for some time, have been endeavouring to use actions to fight violence against women and children. This phenomenon of violence against women and children is, unfortunately, not only very widespread but is increasing, and is gradually taking on new, even more sophisticated forms, which are therefore more difficult to combat.  The programme we are debating today is the result of this previous work. A very thorough discussion took place with the Executive Commission, especially with regard to amending the legal basis and therefore making the adjustments implied in the proposal to the original proposal.  I do not wish to return to this topic, but I would like, however, to express a certain amount of satisfaction, despite the change to the legal basis, that the Commission and the Council have in any case adopted some elements which are extremely important to us. I am referring to the fact that the common position contains references to health in terms of physical, mental and social well-being, to quality of life and to violence as a violation of human rights, and, in particular, to the fact that this programme also covers victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation. I also find it especially significant that there is recognition of the important role played by the NGOs and multidisciplinary networks as well as public bodies who are already carrying out valuable work, in particular with regard to the prevention of violence and the support and protection of victims. To give this programme real added value, we must launch a major awareness campaign involving Parliament and the Commission, but, above all, the Member States, which must take complete responsibility for fighting violence.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in April 1999, the European Parliament adopted at first reading its legislative resolution on the Commission proposal establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Union. The proposal for a directive establishes a framework which aims to remedy the gaps and counter the shortcomings of the national and Community legislation currently in force.  The objectives of this proposal are the following: to ensure that the right to regular information and consultation of employees on economic and strategic developments in the firm and on the decisions which affect them exists in all Member States of the European Community; to consolidate social dialogue and relations of trust within the firm in order to assist risk anticipation, develop the flexibility of work organisation within a framework of security and enhance employees’ awareness of the need to adapt, encouraging this; to include the situation and anticipated development of employment within the firm among the subjects of information and consultation; to ensure that workers are informed and consulted prior to decisions which are likely to lead to substantial changes in work organisation or in contractual relations; ensure the effectiveness of these procedures by introducing specific penalties for those who seriously violate their obligations in this field. In this regard, we have seen recently – judging by some debates held in this Chamber – how important it is to lay down a precise reference framework for information and consultation.  This proposal will ensure minimum standards for information and consultation to be applied throughout the Community, by harmonising the fundamental rights of employees – these are already in place in many Member States – and helping to strengthen the European social dimension, which is what we are all aiming for.  The European Parliament has adopted a series of amendments, aiming, in particular, to specify procedures and definitions for information and consultation, in particular as regards the moment at which information should be transmitted. We believe, however, that it is important for this to be carried out during the planning stage so as to allow employees to anticipate change, extending the Directive’s field of application and ensuring that it contains minimum provisions at Community level, derogations from which may be allowed only if they are more favourable to employees, as well as extending the content to the areas which directly affect the workers and their future.  The Commission reacted positively to some amendments to our report and voiced reservations about others. Nevertheless – and here is the reason for this oral question – it still has not tabled a revised proposal that clearly states its position on Parliament’s amendments, and also – and I must say this with regret, in that we had expected the Finnish Presidency to take this issue into account – the Finnish Presidency has not shown the political will to continue with this dossier. The reason for this question is, in fact, to ask the Commission not just to express its position on Parliament’s proposals clearly, but, above all, to ask it for the procedures and time periods for the tabling of its own revised version on Parliament’s position.  On behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the question I would like to ask the Commissioner – who moreover, has displayed great sensitivity on these subjects in other circumstances – is the following: can you tell us what the conflicting aspects of the matter are and the reasons why a revised proposal has not yet been tabled? Moreover, can you anticipate the proposal to be tabled before the end of the year? But above all, what measures do you intend to adopt to facilitate a political agreement on the issue, an agreement which is of prime importance for the Commission, Council and Parliament to be able to take a final decision on this matter? We consider this to be especially important, and besides, it is part of a more wide-ranging issue which is concerned with preparing and accompanying the changes underway in the labour market, so that they do not produce negative results, especially as far as employees’ job security is concerned.

 Mr President, in its document on the guidelines on employment policies in the Member States for 2000, the Commission takes as its starting point a basic consideration: that after its launch at the extraordinary summit, the progress made in the development of the process towards employment has been considerable. It states that 1.8 million additional jobs have been created in Europe, and therefore confirms the four pillar structure and the main points of the guidelines.  We can agree on the need to keep the structure substantially unchanged. Nevertheless, despite Mr Menrad’s commendable work, both the Commission document and the European Parliament report could have and, above all, should have attempted more. In particular, coordination between the macroeconomic policies and the guidelines for employment must change from being simple dialogue to agreement between the Member States, without invalidating the competences and responsibilities of the States themselves, which no-one is calling into question. However, the guidelines and recommendations at European level need to be transformed into concrete, quantifiable objectives which the Member States must aim towards with their own national plans – concrete objectives which define targets that we can gauge in the medium term, converging in terms of employment levels and the reduction of the current gap between the employment of men and women, and also through investments in infrastructure and services and the promotion of youth employment. We need to establish quantitative and qualitative indicators. It is not a question of a solution at European level, as some fear, but it is, of course, a question of recommending a range of instruments which will effectively allow us to create employment and bring about social cohesion. We need, then, to take a giant leap forwards. We need to be bold. The launch of the single currency was possible because constraints were set down. If we do not do the same for employment we will never achieve sufficient results.

 Mr President, we are here once again – this is not the first time, unfortunately – to discuss a very serious problem: the redundancies of thousands of workers due to the unilateral choices of a firm. And the Michelin case, which I do not want to talk about in detail because other speakers have already done so, gives us the opportunity for this debate.  In many Member States – as recent history reminds us – there have been cases of restructuring: indeed, history is full of cases of restructuring, relocations and firm closures – Mr Wurtz reminded us of some – which not only reduce employment, but jeopardise the economic and social cohesion of affected areas, create a climate of social insecurity among workers and create a climate which certainly does not encourage development and growth. The requirement for greater competitiveness of firms, especially in the era of globalisation of the economy must, however, be able to combine the necessary flexibility within companies with the security of workers. These processes, these phenomena which are becoming increasingly more frequent, must be regulated using the instruments available and these must be improved. Commissioner Diamantopoulou, whom I would like to thank for the clarity of her statement, spoke of intelligent restructuring. The existing instruments for prevention and management of the phenomena must be used both at national and European level, because job losses, Mr Pronk, concern Europe. They do not only concern individual countries, but all of us.  In particular, the case we are discussing today should give the Commission the chance to pledge today, before the European Parliament, that it will make an assessment, a revision of the Directive on redundancies and the closure of companies to make it more effective in terms of protecting jobs. Moreover, we need to speed up the re-examination of the Works Council Directive, strengthening information processes and consultation in particular but, I would add, we must also include in that directive the fundamental issue of sanctions. Rules must be obeyed, and those who do not obey them must pay the price.

 Mr President, we have called for this discussion on Burma because we are on the eve of the decisions that the Council of the Union must take to renew sanctions against the regime which oppresses this country by means of a cruel military dictatorship and continuously violates the most basic human rights and the rights of ethnic minorities.  Firstly, we are asking the Council to confirm and strengthen its common position on sanctions. This is the request made by my group and the other groups which have subscribed to the motion for a resolution that we are discussing today. Unfortunately, no positive developments have been reported in Burma, but we are witnessing a worsening of the repression, as the resolution says. Over the last few weeks there have again been dozens of arrests of Burmese citizens and foreigners who continue to fight for democracy and human rights in this country. At this time, we must reconfirm our complete and total solidarity with, and give our sympathy to Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, President of the League for Democracy which obtained the majority of votes in the 1990 elections. Despite the limitations imposed on her freedom of movement and expression, this courageous woman is continuing her tenacious opposition to the regime, and we cannot fail to remember the inhuman way she was treated by the regime on the death of her husband. This has already been condemned by this Parliament. The resolution also asks the Burmese Government to put an immediate stop to the loathsome practice of forced labour which much of the civilian population is forced to do and which particularly affects children and women from ethnic minorities. We also denounce, as does the International Labour Office, these practices as a crime against humanity. The European Union must consider the situation in Burma to be one of the key areas for its international action in the defence of human rights and democracy. We must hold our battle up as an example to all the other similar regimes in the world, but we must also succeed in transforming it increasingly into a coherent, efficient and practical policy. The Member States must also join the fight to tackle the Burma question in accordance with the common position of the Council, with the same intensity in all the international bodies: from the UN to the regional organisations which unite the Asian countries. Only the isolation of the military dictatorship through sanctions and dialogue with the opposition groups and the ethnic minorities can contribute to establishing democracy in Burma. (Applause)
