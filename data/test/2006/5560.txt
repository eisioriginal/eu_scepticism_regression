 Madam President, I would also have preferred to speak directly to Mr Sarkozy and Mr Barroso, in particular because I wanted to approach the President of the Commission, as we have had little success with some of the Commissioners in recent years. The citizens expect Europe to concern itself with important matters and not with trivialities. Mr Schulz, who has just left the Chamber, has lumped all the Conservatives together. People do not expect to be nannied over minor issues. Instead they want more freedom from regulation for small and medium-sized businesses and for citizens and more action on major questions. I would like to emphasise that the European Parliament has already called on the Commission in 2003 to present a proposal on credit rating agencies. Amazingly the Commission has become aware in the meantime of the term hedge fund, although this undoubtedly is not true of all the Commissioners. The Commission President is now looking into this area. Mr Schulz made things very simple for himself by stating that only the Conservatives were to blame. In fact it was the Council which over many years prevented any progress being made in the area of supervision. It was the German finance ministers Mr Eichel and Mr Steinbrück. I would like to remind Parliament that the person who was regularly responsible for slowing things down at a European level – and I would ask the socialists to tell their Chairman this – was Mr Koch-Weser, who now holds a good position at Deutsche Bank. In future we expect Europe to introduce its moral values and priorities into the regulation of the financial markets. This means sustainability, not just maximising the risks in order to maximise the returns. It also means focusing on the fundamentals, as a medium-sized business would do. This is something which we must introduce in an international context. It is not enough simply to hold international conferences. Europe must be united in order to ensure at an international level that something like this does not happen again.

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, listening to the Commissioner's statement just now, it felt as if I was in the wrong film. He repeatedly emphasised that swift and rapid action is being taken. In reality, the only thing that has moved swiftly in recent weeks, months and years is the market, which is frequently invoked in our regular debates here. The fact is that the market regulated the problem of the investment banks very quickly on its own. We were unable to react as swiftly. 'Swift' is certainly not the word that we can use when we look at the Council and particularly the Commission. We are now being kindly invited by the Americans to pay a share. I do not wish to comment on that at this juncture. It is enough, at this stage, to monitor developments. However, what I expect from the Council – although when it comes to the Commission, I am not sure whether the Barroso Commission is capable of this – is to ensure, at the least, that we overcome the American and British resistance to transparency in the financial markets. I need only remind you of the German Presidency, when President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel came up with an initiative and the Barroso Commission sat back and said, 'Who is Sarkozy and who is Merkel anyway?' and took no action. 'Swift' is really not the word we can use. I need only remind you of Enron and Parmalat. At the time, the European Parliament had adopted a relevant report by Mr Katiforis – I was the shadow rapporteur – on the issue of credit rating agencies. That was back in 2003. Now, in October 2008, the Commission may well present proposals, but the IOSCO is already saying that we should not deviate from the Securities and Exchange Commission and US rules, for otherwise the international financial system will be disrupted. Europe must go its own way here. That is why I do not really care what the SEC is proposing, and if the Commission plans to move in the same direction as the SEC, all I can say is that it should wrap up warmly. We must do what we think is right, and the Americans can then follow us. That is all I have to say about rating agencies. It has been said that we should deal with the revision of Basel II at one reading. I hope that the Council representative is listening, as that is something that he mentioned. We can do it at one reading, as long as the Council gives up its opposition to a European supervisory regime. What the Council has achieved so far through its closer cooperation with the European supervisory authorities is lamentable. Nice was based on intergovernmental cooperation. That being the case, the Council should jump over its own shadow for once and think along European lines. Hedge funds have also been mentioned, along with private equity. Commissioner McCreevy told the House only this week that we must not be overhasty. We can accuse Mr McCreevy of many things, but being overhasty is not one of them. (Heckling and applause)
 I have regularly attacked Mr McCreevy in the House on the issue of hedge funds and private equity. We must ensure that the Commission now presents proper analyses and does not remain in a state of denial. This is no longer Mr McCreevy's problem; it is now Mr Barroso's problem. (Applause)
 I would be delighted if we were now to make it clear to the US that the SEC – the Securities and Exchange Commission – should put its own house in order for once. Siemens is the subject of a rigorous investigation, but no one looks at the US. I expect the Commission and the Council to enable us to set out a European policy course in this area. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur. I have been having a few additional thoughts about Slovakia’s accession to the euro area over the last few days. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be voting in favour of this report. Based on the events surrounding the change from the koruna to the euro, we again submitted relevant amendments and compromise proposals because this change, which was more than the allowable 15% fluctuation, led to a dispute in Parliament too. All we can do is ask of the Commission – and not just ask, but actually insist – that it helps out here so that for future adoptions of the single currency, the criteria that are already laid down in the Treaty will be made specific. Since becoming a Member of the European Parliament, I have been present every time a new country has adopted the single currency. Each time, we have been presented with new arguments, including the one that ‘after all, the previous states were able to do it this way too’, and this will become a neverending story. I consider it important that we see joining the euro area less as a matter of national honour and more as a goal of making the criteria more objective, which is good for the state that is joining. The upward revaluation of the koruna by more than 17% is certainly economically justified. Whether it was right to combine the timing of the revaluation with entry to the euro area is another matter. Therefore, we should do everything possible to ensure that the euro and the overall economy achieve something good, rather than restricting ourselves to the point of view of a political situation of limited duration, whether European or national. Let me mention briefly what happened on Thursday. I think it is wrong for the European Parliament to ignore this repeatedly, and we will have a major debate about this tomorrow. We will vote today on whether Slovakia should join the euro area and ECOFIN will do so in July. We saw on Thursday how one member of the euro area said that it did not want the European Union to be the way it is. High representatives of your home country then chimed in along the same lines, Commissioner. The euro was never an end in itself. The euro was always just a marker along the way to further development of the European Union. Now – although the Council is not here, unfortunately – everyone is asking the same question: where to with Europe now? What are the next specific steps? Some are talking about the core of Europe, others of alternatives, still others are saying we should stop expanding, but some are behaving as if nothing will change. Therefore, we will try again with the euro, and even try again after that. However, when we make these decisions, we should bear in mind the political realities in the European Union, so when we vote today, I will have very mixed feelings about whether simply ignoring the vote – the reality in Europe – is really the right thing to do.

Madam President, the subject matter of the report before us would seem, at first glance, to be highly technical. It concerns so-called accounting standards in the European Union and worldwide, particularly for small and medium-sized companies. It may very well be the type of subject that is discussed now in the European Parliament and then takes several years to begin to affect the economy and ordinary people. At that stage the cry will go up that nobody knows where these standards come from or who is responsible for them. Nor will anyone know why they have to be applied. The objective is to achieve a single set of global accounting standards, particularly for public limited companies. We support that objective. The argument we hear advanced for it is that we need ‘high quality standards’, and this House considers itself the only forum empowered to set those high quality standards. However, in these times of turbulence on the financial markets, it is astonishing to hear the same people who previously argued for the principle of ‘fair value’ now questioning that principle and asking, too, whether a ‘market to market’ approach still makes sense if we no longer have a market. The very people who let the genie out of the bottle are the ones now asking whether we are on the right track. The only people responsible for these standards are the people sitting in the offices of this private organisation in London, who are undoubtedly influenced in making their standards by the desire to keep themselves in a job. My report, on which we are to vote today, therefore concerns not just the impact on small and medium-sized companies, but also the fundamental question of who makes rules for whom, and who supervises the application of the rules. The first issue to address is that of governance: how transparent is this organisation? In other words, how transparent is its funding? There are certainly hidden interests here. The members of this committee, who are demanding transparency and always try to portray the market as transparent, should make at least a modicum of effort to comply themselves with the transparency requirements they lay down for the market! My impression so far is that this organisation fights with every means at its disposal to avoid transparency in any form. Who takes the decisions about financing and the choice of personnel for specific posts? Why are individuals appointed? Is it about regional balance? Is it about inter-sector balance? The current project concerns IFRS for small and medium-sized companies, so it is fair to ask who represents small and medium-sized companies. Who knows about small and medium-sized companies? And another thing: why are IFRS for small and medium-sized companies actually on the agenda right now? Who sets the agenda? Commissioner McCreevy and Sir David Tweedie have also been asked many times, over a number of years, why we are actually doing this. Several years down the line we now know why we are discussing IFRS for small and medium-sized companies in Europe: it is because of requests from South Africa and Brazil. What a marvellous answer! We know quite well that the focus of all this is not South Africa or Brazil, but rather the European market, where there will be a lot of money to be made if SMEs are required to introduce something like this. So these are the issues at stake in the matter of governance – and some initial, positive steps have been taken. But all the bodies that are to be set up in the future will be assessed according to whether the people who belong to this supervisory organisation and have to answer questions about it at political level – and they could include a Member of the Commission – will also have the power to shape new developments. It is not enough for them simply to be notified of proposals. One of our aims is convergence. We must take care, however, that the interpretation of convergence does not slip from Europe’s grasp, to be replaced by the SEC’s interpretation. In Europe today we are sufficiently familiar with the way the US stock exchange is supervised. We should not be so naïve as to leave the business of supervision to the Americans. What we want is therefore what we have already called for: IFRS as Europe understands them and not as this board dictates. Small and medium-sized companies are the ones affected here, and I have to say, without mincing my words, that the ideas on the table today are too complicated and too difficult. I would also warn against taking the voluntary approach. I am wearing my Bavarian national costume today and a good old Bavarian term comes to mind here: it is ‘hinterfotzig
’ and it means something like ‘through the back door’. We know very well – despite all the denials and the acquiescence – that IFRS for small and medium-sized companies will be introduced to the European market through the back door, via a small number of Member States. We will then hear the same voices calling for a single set of standards, and they will proceed to foist their standards on the market – standards which are too complex, which nobody understands and nobody wants – purely because there is a market opportunity. What we have here is a case of a minority trying to impose its will on a majority at global level, and it is unacceptable!

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much indeed for this debate, in which the main thrust of the report has certainly received support and alternatives have been outlined in various areas. I should like to pick up on two things. There is one point on which I am sure we all agree, and it has been made repeatedly today by speakers who fully support this general development, namely that the IFRS organisation has now taken some action, for example on governance issues, as a result of the pressure applied by this House – by the European Parliament – and by the European Union. There are times when we need to be quite blunt – and I am aware that some of my female colleagues have criticised me in that regard – because certain individuals who have appeared before this House in recent years have occasionally given the unmistakable impression that the European Parliament is of little interest to them. How little progress there has been is clear from the proposal on governance, where it is suggested that the future supervisory bodies may take advice only from persons they have appointed. All I can say is that anyone required in future to report to a parliament on how he or she voted on a particular point should make sure that a share of responsibility and a say in policy-making is part of the package. That is the first point. How little commitment there is on the matter of impact assessments is clear from current discussions, in which the IFRS organisation is still refusing to conduct them. Turning to the question of standards for SMEs, I have something to say to all those who believe we should introduce them on a voluntary basis. Inspired here by John Purvis – John, this is for you – I intend to quote an independent commentator. Peter Holgate, a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers, writing in the German edition of the Financial Times
, said the following:  ‘I don’t take the European position all that seriously. Even if they end up not endorsing it, various countries could adopt it in their national generally accepted accounting principles. If a few major players do that you have it brought in by a different door even if the EC doesn’t want to play ball.’  At the end of the day, this means you have to assume that, once a few states have adopted these standards, you will have them imposed on a compulsory basis throughout the European Union. Such is the strategy of this organisation. PricewaterhouseCoopers has already indicated that they see this as a business model. That is why we need our own European set of standards for SMEs: we can build on the IFRS if that is appropriate but if it is not, then we will develop our own standards. It is the Commission’s responsibility to ensure that we do not have standards foisted on us through the back door, which nobody wants but which would then become generally binding.

Madam President, Commissioner, in 1999 we initiated the European single financial market project and have since been pressing ahead with it. We are on the path to success. We now have to see that market developments do not overtake political developments. The Lamfalussy Process was a step in this direction. Level 3 could be a way of bringing supervisors in Europe a step closer together. However, I hold on to what Commissioner Almunia has said, and that is: act quickly and effectively. We are going through a sub-prime crisis or sub-prime turbulence. The Americans – whether they are the SEC, the White House, politicians or the offices of the District Attorney in New York or Washington – have long been drawing up the relevant summaries and thinking about what measures are required, while finance ministers in Europe are still reflecting on which direction they could be taking. The finance ministers are refusing to push a European supervisory structure, so I shall not be talking about a European supervisor here. What the finance ministers already have to answer for, however – and here I appeal specifically to the Council – is the fact that Europe is not present at the international discussion on how to deal with this problem. Once again we shall ultimately find ourselves merely adopting the rules of other nations, such as the United States, for example. I would just remind you of the Katiforis report. After Parmalat and Enron, we asked the Commission and Council in 2003-2006 to speak out on rating agencies.
 The Commission does indeed analyse everything in Europe, but when crises arise, no analysis takes place. On the subject of hedge funds, for instance, no analysis is taking place in the European Union. Hence my urgent appeal: throw off your lethargy, leave your national egotisms behind and keep working on turning the European financial market into a success story not only in Europe, so that what has stood the test here also becomes the rule throughout the world.

Madam President, sum up globalisation in two minutes – well, here goes! My first request is that we deal a little more honestly with the subject of globalisation in our discussions. My native region of Bavaria earns half of its GDP from exports. Many people are critical of globalisation, but if we asked them whether they agreed that their local companies should not be allowed to serve the world market any more, they would say ‘no’. Likewise, if we turned to the public galleries and asked whether anyone was prepared to give up the opportunity to buy competitively priced goods – be they electrical appliances, textiles or other products – there would be no volunteers. Everyone knows that imports from low-cost countries are the reason for the low inflation rates of recent years. It is only right and proper to acknowledge that, even if we regularly speak of globalisation as a threat. Europe must shape the globalisation process, for it has been benefiting our manufacturers as well as our consumers. That is the purpose, for instance, of eliminating red tape, which is an important objective both for Commissioner Verheugen and for Europe. I do not wish to imply that this is a task for the Commission alone; I am also referring to Parliament and the Council. We are speaking about globalisation now, but afterwards we shall be adopting the Soil Protection Directive and creating more red tape. In short, our actions need to be rigorously consistent in Europe, and it is our mission to shape Europe. When we consider the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, we need to realise that international financial markets are intertwined and that we Europeans must help to make things happen. How do we deal with rating agencies, and how do we deal with hedge funds? Regrettably, Commissioner McCreevy, who is responsible for these matters, has not yet taken the lead in the movement to rein in the Americans and other markets, and so Europe is lagging behind. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that Europe is well prepared for globalisation. We are benefiting from it, which we must explain to the public, and we must press for minimum standards, although these would not be European standards, and then we shall be prepared and fit to win the globalisation game. Whether or not globalisation takes place is not determined in Brussels or Strasbourg.

 Mr President, Commissioner, this discussion on comitology has been going on for a long time. On the basis of the Basel II report, the European Parliament has finally won rights of scrutiny that should actually be normal in a democracy, against huge opposition from the Council and opposition from the Commission. Now we must attend to adapting the directives accordingly. Here the focus has been on the question of adapting the relevant directives – and that is understandable. The question of the extent to which we adapt the directives legislatively is certainly an important aspect. However, the agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council is about how Parliament can be appropriately involved. The Commissioner expressed her hope that Parliament will adopt the relevant alignments in the current year. It is important to us that Parliament be informed about the processes in good time and that the exchange of information to Parliament via the comitology committees take place promptly. The actual implementation phase is yet to begin and time will tell whether or not this will strengthen the rights of Parliament. The same applies to requests for urgent debate. To take one example: accounting is next on the agenda, IFRS 8. Here the procedure was that we in the comitology process were, unfortunately, only informed by the Commission at the last minute. Then we were expected to take a decision relatively quickly. The key, apart from the formal alignment process, will be whether the Commission, the relevant Directorates-General, the officials working in this area, are willing to include Parliament in the work in good time. Only then will effective scrutiny be possible. This is where it will be revealed whether the Commission as a whole is for this or not.
 Alexander Radwan,  
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group
. – Mr President, Commissioner, the IFRS 8 process is symptomatic of where we stand today with regard to implementation, endorsement, of IFRS in Europe. I should like to say very clearly from the outset, to those who perhaps always assume the opposite of Parliament, that the majority of the European Parliament is in favour of IFRS, of a global standard, and of taking the same course on this, the right course. We ought to examine this IFRS process, in particular, in relation to whether all is well with it at the moment: the Commission presents the European Parliament with a standard at short notice, the Commission and industry are expected to implement it relatively quickly, pressure from industry gets stronger and stronger, and those who have the duty of justifying it to citizens on the ground are not given any opportunity to form an opinion on it. The Commission has prescribed an appropriate phase, but we are going to have to do some straight talking about what has happened now, as the implementation phase is now being postponed retrospectively. To avoid this happening in future it is vital that the legislative institutions, such as the European Parliament, are informed about the work in good time. I welcome the announcement last week by the Commission, with the SSI, the Japanese and IOSCO. What the IFRS organisation then presented – regarding providing its own governance – is a correct, but long-overdue step towards appropriate legitimisation and governance. We, the European Parliament, shall pay particular attention to whether democratic rules of play are observed. That does not mean that the European Parliament must be directly involved, but only if the process is working correctly shall we be able to ensure that it operates optimally in future when each individual standard is implemented – and in future we shall be consulted about each individual standard.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by expressing my heartfelt thanks to the rapporteur for her work, with which she has succeeded in uniting a broad political spectrum in the European Parliament. The single market for financial services in the EU has been a success story. The recommendations of the Commission, their implementation by Parliament and the Council and in Member States will result in the European financial market gradually becoming more attractive than the US financial market. This is further illustrated by the fact that European stock markets are being bought up by Americans so that they can secure their influence on them. This has led to new developments, and begs the question of how we should approach the new events on the market. A main point is the future of controls in Europe. The development of trans-border banks is a case in point. I will mention only UniCredito, the Bavarian-based HypoVereinsbank, and Bank Austria. We also discussed ABN Amro and the Bank Santander that was bought up in Britain. We have to ensure that the supervisory authorities keep an eye on these events, so that we do not have a single supervisor for each Member State, but that there is Europe-wide cooperation. That is not a request for a European supervisor, but we must bring European development further to the centre of attention. Basle II and the lead supervisor were the first step in this direction. I wholeheartedly support the Commission to take a courageous approach in Solvency II. I hope that the national supervisors and national finance ministries will become more cooperative in this respect, and show more support for the amendments than they have shown so far. We also need to give some thought to how we will shape the transatlantic relationship in the future. The way things stand, the SEC – the American supervisory authority – always has an indirect effect on regulating the European market. This should not be happening. We need a European response to the SEC which seeks to prevent this from happening. I cite the example of an Austrian bank which had to get rid of its clients because it was being bought up by an American fund, and the clients were Cuban. Commissioner, the Commission regularly deals with regional banks. Quite rightly, too. Mrs Bowles, I do not want to anticipate the result of the discussion, but we need to discuss hedge funds in an open debate. What we cannot say is let us avoid the issue because we are afraid of the result.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will confine my remarks today to the procedure and will not comment on the many other points that have been addressed. In terms of substance I can quite frankly echo Mr Langen’s assessment of Malta and Cyprus and his comments on Parliament’s approval. I will therefore concentrate on the procedure. Here I will simply take the words of the Minister of State, Mr Glosar, as my starting point. He said that we should not primarily consider the procedure. There was talk of sympathy, requests and considering. For the next procedure I should like to say: we will sympathetically consider Council and the Commission’s requests to make our decisions quickly. Next time, however, we will also use the procedure that Parliament provides for such matters. We fully understand the Council’s constraints with its meeting schedule. The Commission’s constraints too, and the 1 January deadline: all of these things are well understood in Parliament. However, if there is no understanding the other way round, that we in Parliament also have a particular procedure and that we are now unable, and not for the first time, to observe one of the basic rules of that procedure properly, for example the translation deadlines, then next time round there will be consequences. We can therefore only press for an appropriate agreement to be adopted between the institutions. Otherwise the Council would have to see to it that Parliament were no longer consulted in the future. It has of course been mentioned that this is enshrined in the relevant Treaty, and if it is enshrined in the Treaty then it has to be respected. The German Foreign Office and all European foreign ministries have made repeated attempts to stop Parliament becoming too powerful. This, however, applies to other fields. Nevertheless, one area that is very important to me is data provision. That is why we in Parliament want to have sufficient time to deal with this. We have seen what happened with Greece and Hungary. We hold the Commission responsible for guaranteeing that the data on which the decision for an accession is based is also scrutinised as thoroughly as possible, so that we can assume that it is correct. I need only refer to the comments of the Hungarian Finance Minister, who, following what happened in Hungary, publicly philosophised about the various possibilities that are actually open to a finance minister when supplying data to Brussels. The ECB President, Mr Trichet, has also pointed out that collecting data in the European Union is problematic. For us it is crucial that the Commission does not pass the buck to Eurostat in such cases but that it takes responsibility itself. However, we should also like to strengthen the Commission vis-à-vis the Member States. It is unacceptable that the Commission should have to comply with such requests when the Member States continue to use all of the means at their disposal to restrict the Commission’s supervisory powers in areas where they really do need to be exercised.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak today on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in particular, and on the subject of the financial markets, in which we Europeans have already, and for a very long time, been caught up in an international, and trans-Atlantic, network of relationships, and so I will also be speaking, as one who has practical experience of these matters, on a project of economic cooperation involving Europe and America, one that we welcome and support. Particularly where lawmaking is concerned, we do have some reservations and some experience, which I might sum up by mentioning Basel II and AFAS, and I would like to address my remarks to the Council in particular, for I can tell Mr Gloser that we must take care, in dealing with this, that this House’s prerogatives and Europe’s rights are treated as equal with those of the Americans when it comes to laying down the rules, for what happened with Basel II was that the Americans ended up deciding not to implement the package. We also have to consider the issue of regulation, of which regulation is applied, and where; need I mention ‘Sarbanes-Oxley’? We have, on repeated occasions, raised with the Commission the consequences of the incursion of the ‘newest stock exchange’ into Euronext. Will the regulations be American? To date, the Commission has said that the capital market will decide the matter. BAWAG gives us a contemporary example of how American regulation intervenes directly in the European market in order to detach it from European rules, and the Commission must make its opposition to this unambiguously clear and ask them what they think they are doing. The same, my dear Mr Gloser, does of course apply to the Council, and I would remind you of SWIFT; there, too, European regulation has been forced to make way for its American counterpart. I urge the Commission to at last do something about hedge funds, where an American invasion is in progress, and discussion is going on at the national level. It is a global issue; it is being moved forward; the Commission maintains deep silence on the subject, and the Commissioner responsible regularly says, ‘that’s how the market is’. When international cooperative efforts merge together, it is particularly important that parliamentary control is not eaten away, and I am thinking of the Council in particular when I say that. I am thinking of the comitology debates and the anti-democratic behaviour of the foreign ministries in Europe when I say that I would like to insist on this House being consulted in due time on future projects of this kind, rather than being presented with a fait accompli.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me just start by expressing my most especial thanks to Mr Gauzès, who, together with this House, has put a great deal of work into moving this report forward; now that we have, of course, had the euro for some time, the driving force behind the single payment area in Europe is this House and the European Union, starting with the cross-border charges, now moving on to SEPA, and the particular part played in this by this House is something that needs to be stressed. Despite the cultural and structural differences in the ways in which payments are made in Europe, we have managed to find a solution that fits everyone. The decision was taken in September last year; it was only pressure on the part of this House that got the Council to sort the matter out. Some Member States, unfortunately, still believe they have to retain their inflexible systems in their dealings with the rest of Europe, but that is not what Europe is about; Europe – as Mr Wieland said – is about bringing everyone together. By projects such as this, Europe can show in practical terms what it means to ordinary people. There were, eventually, compromises on such things as D+1, on loans, on payment service providers and on the provisions for consumer protection, and the ultimate goal should still be to set the emancipated citizen as a benchmark, but I do see this as an important further step, and hope that the directive will be implemented accordingly, despite the unresolved issues remaining in some areas. My office has recently been on the receiving end of more and more questions about what actually happens when money transfers are actually effected despite the details being wrong. To give just one example, somebody sent EUR 150 from Germany to Italy and, because of a wrong entry, EUR 113 was deducted in charges. If the banks carry on like that, they will bring the next step on themselves. That is why I urge them to regulate themselves in a sensible manner and to be guided more by what the public want. I hope that this appeal will not lead to the light going out again; after all, it was not as bad as all that. Again, let me extend warm thanks to Mr Gauzès, and to the Commission, for making it possible for us, once again, to get the Council into line.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is said regularly – in the Commissioner’s speeches, for example – that Europe should concentrate on the essentials and that our aim is to bring Europe closer to its citizens. After all, Europe – particularly the Commission, of course – is judged on the extent to which it backs up its words with action. Take bureaucracy reduction, for example – the Commission’s flagship. Looking back over recent weeks, I note that the Commission has presented a new strategy on health at work for the next five years, with particular regard to small and medium-sized enterprises, which identifies SMEs as the scene of most incidents. These will undoubtedly have to reckon with requirements to match in the near future. Take consumer protection: there is now a Green Paper on this that makes the relevant stipulations. I think it is good that the Commission is giving thought to where unnecessary bureaucracy can be eliminated. Commissioner, the best kind of bureaucracy reduction starts with the absence of bureaucracy creation. The Commission has simply failed in this regard in recent years, in that it has continuously presented new legislative proposals. On the other hand – and the Commission’s stubbornness in ignoring Parliament’s words is astonishing – we are stipulating all the records insurance intermediaries will have to keep in future when negotiating with consumers about the relevant products. In terms of the suggestion that we examine the issue of hedge funds without calling for regulation – the risks concerned have been regularly mentioned by Jean-Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank in this House and by the central banks around the world – there is no mention of this in the Commission’s plan for 2008. The Commissioner’s colleague Mr McCreevy is not doing anything in the areas that present real risks – which smacks of neglect of duty. We are not calling for regulation, but simply for an analysis of the status quo. The strategy paper says nothing about this; nothing is being done in this field – which is indeed astonishing. This is strongly reminiscent of clientele politics for the benefit of certain regions of the world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Klinz, for today’s outcome is a very positive one, in that it was achieved rapidly through the good cooperation of the Commission, Parliament and the Council. The reason why a speedy result was necessary was that at the nation state level, there is an increase in protectionism, not only in the financial sector but also in others, for any Member State will be pleased if a company based there can invest in another country and take over businesses in it, but heaven help a company from another country that tries to do likewise; that is when they pull out all the stops and get tough, not only in the financial sector, but also in energy, as we have seen, for example, with Endesa and E.ON. That is why action to deal with this became necessary. I am glad that it was possible to agree on criteria and deadlines, but I have my misgivings about the role played in the debate by the supervisory bodies, who, back in the days of the ‘Basel II’ debate, had not done very much to clarify how they were supposed to monitor the integration of financial markets. In saying this, I am certainly not advocating a European supervisory body, but, given the way the supervisory bodies in Europe have organised things, their primary interest is in staking out their national boundaries, and so the first move should come from us at the European level, and from the Commission, with an invitation being extended to the supervisors to engage in dialogue on the subject. I would also like to say something about hedge funds, which Mr Purvis has already mentioned; although I agree with him wholeheartedly that these should not be demonised, I would like to see discussions – which I believe should include other parts of the world in particular – about the need for the Commission to act in this area, to conduct a one-off evaluation – of the kind that has become a permanent feature in other areas – of how hedge funds should be handled, of how the utterances from the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank on the stability of the financial markets should be understood, and to make a presentation on the subject. Having heard what this House has had to say to the Commission, I get the impression that someone is now refusing to put in the work, and I would be delighted if someone were to pick up this ball and make progress in this area. Commissioner Špidla, there seem to be a lot of proposals being made in your area of responsibility, so perhaps you can fire up Commissioner McCreevy with the ambition to do likewise.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very well remember the statements by Chancellor Merkel in Strasbourg, in which she rightly spoke of European values and also about our need to get across to people, and make it clear to them, what Europe’s strong points are. Mr Gloser, this would appear to be a case in which we should explain to people that the European Union helps them safeguard their rights. We are not concerned in this instance with the issue of combating terrorism. There is consensus in this House on that matter, and it does not need to be discussed. Where, however, do we stand, then, in this debate? We began by discussing airline passenger data, and now we come on to SWIFT. In view of the speed with which the Council debate is currently being conducted, it is to be feared that, over the next few years, we may possibly have further SWIFTs to contend with, but we still have not made further progress. In the meantime, we have a situation in which, under pressure from the United States, a European company signs a memorandum of understanding with the Americans, which Europeans are unable to scrutinise. Moreover, SWIFT still does not even have a registered office in the United States, but only a data bank. That is sufficient for American regulators to be able to take SWIFT to task in Belgium. This is like a running theme. There is more and more American regulation of European affairs, appropriated by the United States without we Europeans managing to adopt corresponding countermeasures and to monitor the effects of these. I would therefore, bearing in mind that Germany does not only have the Presidency of the European Council but also chairs the G7, urge the Commission to take an active stance in this area and, as well as investigating matters, to resolve one issue: how, on the basis of our common values and while adhering to data protection requirements and safeguarding human dignity, are we to join together in combating terrorism?

 Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses the European Central Bank’s position on currency stability. We should not succumb to the temptation to add to the ECB’s responsibilities areas in which the nation states refuse to act, in other words the areas of economic and social reforms. The ECB cannot pay for such reforms alone, nor can it afford to. In this case it is essential that the nation states finally fulfil their obligations. We also support the independence of the European Central Bank, its political independence and the independence of its monetary policy, and all of this right from the selection procedure for its members. I do not know what the results of today's votes will be. I can only tell you that the European People's Party supports the idea of non-politicisation, starting with the selection procedure, and believes that the form of transparency proposed is not helpful. The European Central Bank has numerous other tools in its dialogue and does make use of them, just as other central banks around the world do. There is broad support for this in this House. On the subject of independence, I would like to add that we are fighting for the independence of monetary policy. I also hope, however, that the European Central Bank realises that it should not overplay the subject of independence. We have had an on-going discussing with the European Central Bank for years now on the subject of ‘clearing and settlement’, in particular with Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, and I would just like to remind the House that the European Central Bank has begun a dialogue with the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) on this subject and is now entering into a dialogue with those involved in the market. I would like to state clearly that we are not opposed to dialogue. Perhaps the route that the European Central Bank is proposing, and that it is taking, will be the right one in the end. For us, this is not about a material assessment, but the route by which the European Central Bank becomes a part of the market cannot be chosen unsupervised and in a vacuum cut off from politics. That is why we have been calling so urgently for this – and we hope that the vote today will proceed as we had all envisaged – we need governance, we need a regulatory framework for this area. We cannot have a situation where Parliament and the Commission are deliberating about whether to create a directive, whether to produce with a suitable framework, and the European Central Bank then comes out and claims that none of that affects it and that it will take the route it thinks is right. Do not overdo it here; where monetary policy is concerned, we are on your side.

 Mr President, I would like to use this opportunity to highlight two crucial points in both these reports. The first is that, formally speaking, and as far as I am aware, the new comitology procedure is not yet applicable in this area, but I take it as read that the Commission will take due account of how this House votes, since it will be applicable to new amendments in the future. The second has to do with the question as to how we should apply the IFRS standards in future, an aspect that will become more and more important. What I can say on behalf of our own group is that we, in principle, welcome IFRS standards as an international rule for European businesses, but it has to be said that there are conditions attached to that. Convergence must be achieved, but that must also involve the European outlook and European priorities prevailing in future discussions on this subject. It is for that reason that I am annoyed when I hear, emanating from the Board of Trustees, signals to the effect that a thoroughly critical view is being taken of the discussion as to whether, and if so when, convergence is achievable. The main question, though, has to do with how, in future, we are to devise further standards. It is no secret that we have now had a debate on what are termed ‘IFRS for SMEs’. The wheels are very definitely turning, and discussions are in progress in the relevant bodies; all of this has become quite separate from any political process, and so I would like not only to encourage the Commission but also to urge them to monitor this process very rigorously in the interests of its being subject to political and democratic constraints, and ensure that this House is involved. I am this House’s rapporteur on this subject area, and I also have experience of Basel. You can take it as read that this process will not work on the basis of an agreement being reached at international level and Parliament being left with no option but to adopt it; that is why there needs to be close dialogue between Commission and Parliament. The Commission is not merely encouraged, but also urged, to take active account of European interests and not to allow the Board to present it with faits accomplis
 in the way it has done before on other issues.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, it is a wide-ranging area that we are discussing today. Although it was of the municipal graveyard that Mr Schulz chose to remind us, municipal organisations can also reach the size of major corporations – such is the extent of this spectrum, and it is open to question whether such big structures are always right. Why, though, are we actually discussing this? The reason is that we are balancing the rules of the market, on the one hand, against subsidiarity on the other. That can certainly be a thorny issue, and what comes out at the end is not always rigorous. I am very much in favour of subsidiarity, of locally-made rules, but a standardised definition in a Europe that may well – to pre-empt today's decision – end up with twenty-seven Member States would be a mess of standardised pottage, and that I reject. Europe, though, must always be asking itself what added value accrues from action at the European level, and in what way it benefits the public. Why, then, are we putting such effort into discussing the idea of a framework directive, when the rapporteur himself says that his report is not calling for one in this area? The impression I get from some speakers is that they are doing no more or less than attempting to use this debate as a means of creating competition-free zones that will have a derogation from the services directive. Quite apart from the abolition of market rules, the risk is that we end up with a European standard-issue concept of what services of general interest are, and Europe is too heterogeneous for that to be our goal. What the public, communities, and local politicians need, though, is legal certainty. They want to know what is possible and what is not, and that is where there is great confusion. Take, for example, Munich, the city where I was born. There, at the moment, four major hospitals are being brought together in one company, and nobody knows what has to be submitted to the Commission and what does not. This is where the Commission must work together with Parliament, for what is very disturbing, not least to my own group, is that the Commission still retains a degree of ‘licence’, in the sense that it always takes decisions on the basis of what it thinks right and does not consult the voters or their representatives in the manner to which they are entitled. What is crucial with regard to the latter point – and this is where these debates in this House are actually long overdue – is that the public must understand why what we do is for their benefit. In this field in particular, that is not always clear to them, and what we do in this place is perceived in a quite different way. This is an area where the communications strategy might accomplish something.

 Mr President, first of all, let me, as a German, congratulate Commissioner Frattini on yesterday’s football result and then, rather quickly, move on to the matter in hand. There is nothing at all personal about what I shall say about it; all I want to do is counteract some misconceptions that are becoming current. We are not debating this issue today because the Commission wanted us to, nor, indeed, out of any desire for it on the part of the Council, which, lamentably, left the Chamber before the debate began. We are discussing this issue because the committees that have to work with these agreements – and on this there are major differences in this House – decided that we would. Reference has been made to the British Presidency’s putting this subject on the agenda, and that it indeed did, and because – and this is where comitology comes into it – certain Committees of this House, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs being one of them, were no longer willing to write out a blank cheque and to delegate something without having the right to check up on what was done with it, and that is what we are talking about today; not about giving this House a present, but about something that is the least that it is entitled to in a democratic process. I am, then, all the more astonished by what has been going on recently. At the outset, Commissioner, you said that you were in favour of democracy, and you ended up saying that the sunset clause was less than appropriate. Any parliament is perfectly entitled to place time limits on legislation, and I think it intolerable that the Commission or the Council should make statements of that sort or try to deny this House that right. I would just like to remind the Council that, with reference to the draft Constitution and in the debates on it, it went so far as to agree to the delegation having the right of call-back, yet today, it wants nothing to do with it. Progress has been made – yes, there is no disputing that – and now we have to build on that progress. The agreement must prove its worth in practice. For example, the committees – and here I am talking about my own – received the first consultative draft from the Commission as late as just before the summer break; after the summer break, the eight-week deadline had expired, and we were then told that our decision was expected in three months’ time. It is practice that will demonstrate that the agreement works and that we do not have to abandon our rights. What I would like from the Commission, and even more so from the Council, would be to see those who, in the developing world, plead the cause of democracy and the right of codetermination – and that is mainly done by the foreign ministries – at least applying that same standard in their dealings with the European Parliament; that really would be a great step forward.

) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start thanking not only Mrs Kauppi, the rapporteur, but also all those, the shadow rapporteurs in particular, who have worked on this highly complex topic, for their great effort. Once again, I have to say how deeply disappointed I am in our Bureau; today is an historic date, and on it we have been provided with evidence of how effective parliamentary participation is in the committee procedure. Within the institutions, we – the representatives of the citizens, of the people of Europe – are actually achieving something, and, as we debate it shortly before midnight, we are enjoined to keep things brief. This is not the first time this has happened. I know that the Bureau and the powers-that-be are not interested, yet, all the same, I shall not tire of saying that we should concentrate on showing the public the rights that this House possesses. At the moment, we are discussing the reinforcement of Parliament’s rights in respect of committee procedure, specifically the Lamfalussy procedure. In the week in which the decisive sessions are to be held, the Bureau schedules debate on it for just before midnight; no worse message could be sent about the subject. The good thing that has emerged from this evening is that we have demonstrated that this House plays a cooperative role in dialogue with the Council and the Commission, and that this is not our fault. I call on the Council, both this week and next, to take this positive example to heart. We have demonstrated that we, through the procedure of our committees, can come to decisions that are more efficient, that make possible better regulation and hence also the continuation of the Lamfalussy procedure, that is to say of this House’s right of review, with this House notified in good time and the perspective afforded by the institutionalisation of the call-back. We should adopt something to this effect. I see that the gavel is about to come down; in this House, time is the most important thing. Even so, the Commission should take care that, in the financial markets – for that is what this directive is about – there should in future come into being a European model in which the strengths of all parties are taken into account.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has always endorsed and promoted the enlargement of the European Union and has always said that this enlargement, including accession to the euro zone, must move forward without further delay. That has always been our policy, and it still is our policy. In addition, it has been the policy of the Group of the European People’s Party throughout recent years to fight for a strong euro in line with the Maastricht criteria and accompanied by strict adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact. For this reason there have been extensive discussions with the Commission in recent years whenever the large countries were involved – France, Italy and Germany. We will therefore continue this policy in pursuit of a stable euro and so would like to assure the Commission of our unequivocal support for the clear stance it has taken on the question of our future approach to enlargement of the euro zone. Let me say once again that we are very clearly in favour of new Member States entering the euro zone; this must, however, take place in accordance with particular criteria; we have a certain amount of tradition and rigour to uphold in this respect. So, once again, our heartfelt thanks to the Commission. At the same time, however, I would like to encourage the Commission to be more assertive vis-à-vis 
the Member States when it comes to data. It has the support of Parliament. I also encourage the Member States to grant the Commission more rights in relation to the verification of data pertaining to potential entry. I say this because Parliament will ask the Commission whether it can vouch for the data on which it bases its recommendation. It must therefore be given greater access to information, and this requires the Member States to be more cooperative.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Stark, the Vice-President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, is a convincing candidate for the Executive Board of the European Central Bank. He was involved in the creation of the framework conditions for the euro as State Secretary of the German Ministry of Finance and is, so to speak, one of the founding fathers of the euro. Furthermore, something revealed by the hearing that is very positive is that he is a committed European. That should also be mentioned at this point. He stands for continuity in the European Central Bank, and for the objective of independence, which is particularly important at a time when increasing attempts are being made to subject the European Central Bank to external requirements. He stands for a low rate of inflation, for a stable currency, for the Stability and Growth Pact – which is very important at this particular time, when Member States are finding it hard to make savings. With the enlargement of the euro area around the corner, continuity is the overriding consideration. Speaking of the enlargement of the euro area, I should like to say that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats warmly welcomes Commissioner Almunia’s decision today in this context. The issue of Parliament’s role has also been debated. I, too, should like to see a strengthening of Parliament, and wish to emphasise that Mr Stark stated explicitly that the role of Parliament is very important to him. I hope that, in future, he will intervene accordingly on the Executive Board of the ECB when the CESR external expert group on clearing and settlement is engaged again, as it was just recently: we shall be looking at whether he really gives Parliament top priority. That was just an aside. Something that should play no part in Parliament in future, however, is screening of fundamental attitudes, and that is why we should think carefully about how to do things in future. What we need are candidates with a good image, with the relevant experience, like Mr Stark. It must not be a case of who shares our personal political views and who does not. That is not Parliament’s job, and I would not follow this course. I support the objective of ensuring that there are no national fiefdoms in the European Central Bank. We must also ensure, however, that both large and small economies are equally represented on the Executive Board of the ECB. In conclusion, I wish Mr Stark very great success with his new job, which we hope he will take up – for the sake of the euro and Europe, and an appropriate, effective, significant portfolio in the Governing Council.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, did you know that yoghurt is a matter of national interest? That was the argument put forward by a large founding Member State on the question of whether a takeover of Danone was permissible, even though the company’s turnover and profits are predominantly generated abroad. The present discussion is astonishing. Everyone is in favour of his country’s enterprises going on a buying spree around Europe and the world – but not in his own country. I did not hear anyone in Spain complaining when the Spanish Telefónica took over the German–British enterprise O2 or when Banco de Santander took over a large British financial services provider. I did not see anyone becoming agitated about France seeking to buy up an Italian bank, or Electricité de France acquiring a stake in Energie Baden-Württemberg AG, or UniCredito in Italy acquiring Hypo-Vereinsbank, even though ABN AMRO encountered problems when it tried to take a similar course of action in Italy. We are seeing a great deal of hypocrisy here on the part of Member States and the Council. They are closing their own doors behind them and seeking to do business elsewhere; and thus weakening the European economy. We are labouring under a misapprehension if we believe that the Lisbon objectives can be achieved and we can become stronger by means of national protectionism, when we cannot even withstand the relevant competition in our own area. We need strong enterprises, and also enterprises that go to other countries and introduce more competition there. The Commission faces challenges on two levels. It must examine each case carefully and answer the following questions. Does the fusion benefit consumers? Does it enhance competition? That is the Commission’s real task when it comes to examination, and the answer is often ‘yes’, and occasionally ‘no’. The Commission must take a strict line towards the Council, as confidence that Member States and the Council are thinking in terms of a European approach and of the internal market has suffered greatly in recent years.

 Mr President, Commissioner, there has already been frequent reference in this debate to the Lamfalussy procedure. One ought really to be grateful to the British Presidency, for the tenacity with which the British, whose country is regarded as the cradle of democracy – something to which Mr Karas has already alluded – have fought over a point already agreed on in the ‘Basel II’ directive by the Commission, the Council and Parliament is astounding. If, though, you want to reinforce Parliament’s rights and campaign for that, you cannot but be grateful that every further action of this kind makes this House even more firmly united in the conviction that this is something about which we cannot give way. The issue is that of how we handle the Lamfalussy procedure in future. There is also the question as to how seriously the Council is taking this. Had the British Presidency made even an attempt at doing something – perhaps with the aid of the ‘Friends of the Presidency’ – about sorting out the new inter-institutional agreement, and expended less energy on getting this through as it stood, we would be a good deal further ahead today. What I have to say to the Commission is this: we inserted a date into the ‘Basel II’ directive; that date was 1 April 2008, and until then this House will be backing the Lamfalussy procedure and comitology. We want to support it even after that date, but we do need agreement by then. Let me say, for the benefit of all those whom the news has not yet reached, that we will incorporate this sunset clause in all subsequent directives. When new proposals come from the Commission, we will not allow ourselves to be limited to considering only whether or not individual dates should be changed, but will instead claim the right to consider any directive that gets as far as this House in its entirety. We hope that the Commission will exert appropriate influence on the Council – indeed, we rely on it doing so. I am looking particularly to the Austrian presidency to secure us a solution that at last does justice to all the institutions and enable us to get back to doing our work properly.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the subject of our debate today is a single base for taxation, something that is, in principle, surely to be welcomed, certainly from the point of view of small and medium-sized businesses and particularly in terms of making life in a single internal market easier for them. We cannot always draw a strict distinction between the tax base on the one hand and the tax rate on the other, as the tax base has undoubted effects on the classification of taxes and on the internal balances, and that is something that certainly has to be borne in mind when considering the Commission’s next steps. We do not want some sort of approximation of the various tax systems introduced through the back door, and I think the Commission has a vested interest in that not happening if it is to make headway with the Member States. Finally, I want to say – and I am speaking on behalf of my group when I say this – that we are, without doubt, in favour of fiscal competition. You need only imagine what would happen if we were to lock the 25 European finance ministers in a room and let them out only when the white smoke had appeared and they had agreed on tax harmonisation; if we were to do that, we would be turning Europe into a high-tax region, and that is not what we want. Before I sit down, there is just one other point I would like to make, and it is in the form of a question, namely: how do we arrive at a single tax base? The answer invariably given to that is that we should draw on the international accounting systems. I do not propose to address the question of whether these systems are good or bad or of how they are implemented, but it is, in any case, a process on which European policy-making has scarcely any influence. It is all the more extraordinary that politicians should recommend this system as a guide to how to bring in a single tax base. If this were to be done – and I warn this House, the Council, and the Commission against it – it would mean that policy-makers would have capitulated and surrendered essential competences in this area, and that cannot be the road down which we go.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, we are here to discuss the work programme on which we want to embark in 2006. The first thing I want to say – and I say it not only to the Commission, but also to my fellow-Members of the European Parliament, is that less and better regulation, which we put on our own agenda and demand of ourselves, is also something that we should take seriously in our demands on the Commission as regards what it is due to present on the subject of the internal market and efficiency. We must not regularly frustrate our own demands by calling for the European legislator as soon as we decide something is needed, so a bit more self-discipline is called for. As far as better regulation is concerned, although the Commission’s first actions are very positive and constitute a first step in the right direction, we would ask it to be more consistent in its future actions and to set a benchmark for comparison of transposition in the countries that are notorious for ‘gold plating’, so that it may be made perfectly clear which are transposing European legislation effectively and well and which are imposing additional burdens. I have another request to make of the Commission: our response to the Basel II report was to set up the ‘Friends of the Presidency’ to work on comitology and bring about agreements on Parliament’s rights between the Commission, the Council and Parliament itself. This work is now beginning. The forthcoming legislation will, as regards the comitology especially of financial services have essential clauses permitting it to lapse. It is at this point that I will ask the Commission – for Commissioner McCreevy has done some preparatory work on this – to help us reach an agreement to make the comitology between Parliament and the Council more manageable. The Council is in the sort of position in which it does not always show itself to be particularly cooperative.

 Mr President, this amendment has been agreed, not only with the other groups, but also with the Council and the Commission, as a compromise, and it recurs in Amendment 785. I shall read it out:  ... 'without prejudice to the implementing measures already adopted, on expiry of a two-year period following the adoption of the directive and on 1 April 2008 at the latest, the application of its provisions requiring the adoption of technical rules, amendments and decisions in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be suspended. Acting on a proposal from the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council may renew the provisions concerned in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty and, to that end, they shall review them prior to the expiry of the period or date referred to above.'

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to apologise for having to go to the next meeting straightaway, but there are two things I would like to mention that I believe are important where better lawmaking is concerned. I do not intend to discuss what should be done about the involvement of the press. This is the first step in the right direction; it is courageous and it is the right thing to do. We must give it our backing and encourage the Commission to move on to the ‘main course’, for that we regard as crucial. I have two suggestions to make. The first has to do with the small business sector, to which the Commissioner referred. Where better lawmaking is concerned, I can only hope that representatives of the small and medium-sized business sector will be included among the external groups of experts whose advice is to be sought. The fact is that industry can certainly cope with and accept certain aspects of regulation, but local small businesses and local craftsmen may well not be able to, and will go bust. So I ask, I appeal, as a matter of urgency, that these external groups give small and medium-sized enterprises the representation they deserve. The second point I want to make is that complaints from the national level about over-regulation are a regular occurrence, and it often turns out that, rather than the over-regulation originating from Europe, its cause is in fact to be found in the complicated way in which the Member States transpose it. What is needed is the boldness to highlight the perverse ways in which European rules are sometimes applied and bring in a benchmark to indicate who is acting in such a way as to benefit the public and who is doing it in such a way as to inconvenience them.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is for once no mere formality that I start by thanking my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs and all members of the Committee for having made it possible for us all to work together on this directive in a constructive manner. I would also like to thank the Commission for working with us over recent years – for this draft did not come into being overnight – and enabling us to make progress. I see this as being, perhaps, a good example of how we can work together on making laws in the future. This evening, I would like, at the outset, to point out a fly in the ointment. I agree with the Chairman of our Committee that we are engaged in making laws that will have far-reaching effects on Europe’s financial sector and small and medium-sized businesses, and, speaking on behalf of our President, I would remind you, Mr President, and the Bureau too, that this House possesses full legislative powers in this area. Perhaps you could look through the agendas for this week and find another subject, another position where we adopt acts under the codecision procedure, unless you really do think that everything we discuss this week is of high priority. I refer here also to the Doorn report, which also has to do with Parliament’s full legislative powers. In dealing with this directive, Parliament has always emphasised that it is important to us that certain areas be made Basel-compatible. Basel is an international agreement. We have always seen the small business sector as important. It was always important to us that there should, in this regulatory framework, be special arrangements made for small banks, in order that they should not be squeezed out of the competition; take for example the partial application, or the demand in the report that banks opting in future for the Standardised Approach, should not be discriminated against by the national supervisory bodies. Another example I would give is that of the granularity agreed on in Basel and present in the Commission proposal, but which is absent from Parliament’s resolution and must not be re-inserted through the back door. I would point out that this needs also to be transposed by the national parliaments and incorporated into supervisory practice. There are a number of new things in this directive that will change financial supervision in Europe, for example the Lead Supervisor System, under which one supervisor can overrule another when approving internal ratings, and which puts us on the way to a European market. Another example, and one on which there was a great deal of consensus in this House, was the disclosure of ratings, which is of particular importance to small and medium-sized businesses, and I am grateful to the Council for eventually accepting Parliament’s proposed compromise on this. There was lengthy discussion of intergroup exposures. 
I maintained from the very outset that banks’ internal loans should receive equal treatment based on the risks involved, for this document is about risk rather than competition. It is because different structures already exist in Europe that we should not prescribe structures for this, for we cannot say that one is better than another. We must, though, weigh up their merits. Here, too, we have come up with a compromise, and so we have achieved a good result as regards the substance. Comitology is a weak point and will remain one. I want to emphasise that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has always given the Lamfalussy procedure’s comitology its backing, believing this to be right and important in terms of quick legislation that meets the needs of the market, but we had always considered the former Lamfalussy agreement in the light of a future constitution, by providing for a callback mechanism. Today, we need no new debate on the Constitution, but if, in future, we come to draft more directives using Lamfalussy comitology, we will need to conclude a new agreement on the subject to secure Parliament’s rights by providing that, where we delegate them, we can also ‘call them back’, by which I mean better scrutiny, more options for definitions and also the general withdrawal of the delegated power if things start to go wrong. As I will not be able to take the floor when we discuss the Doorn report, let me briefly say that there is one area that is excluded from its resolution. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will, though, in future, be responsible for the International Accounting Standards. As I see it, though, even if this is not what we decide tomorrow, this agreement should also include the international convention on accounting standards. It is not acceptable that, in the future, international bodies should define standards and that these should be implemented without scrutiny by this House. Let me just remind the House that we had a visit some time ago from some people from the Board of the IAS, who informed us that they were working on standards for SMEs. We will not – and I say this not least for the Commission’s benefit – accept these standards without the necessary scrutiny. I hope we are on the right track here, and, to the Presidency, I would say that I hope that it will take on board the compromises we have put forward today. I am optimistic, not only as regards the date for the sunset clause, but also as regards the recitals, about our chances of achieving a good compromise this week and that we will succeed in our aim of getting this adopted at first reading. What I hear from many Member States is that they are doing these things already, and I believe we are on the right track towards achieving this. It is down to the Council.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying something about procedure. We are dealing here with a piece of the European Parliament’s legal history, for it was in 1992 that the Commission came to a decision on the subject, and today finds us debating it at – and let me stress this – its second 
reading. When we vote on it, as we will do tomorrow, we will be bound by the rule that a majority is required to reject or amend it. Speaking as someone who was not even an MEP at the time of its first reading, I have to say that I find it intolerable that neither the Commission nor the Council are similarly bound in the case of a proposal made at a time when most of us were not yet MEPs. Even though the Rules of Procedure permit it, I was not able to table any amendments in the Committee. That is why we should all press for such curiosities to be done away with. It is also a reason why the CDU/CSU has tabled this motion for the directive to be rejected; we did so not because we reject justified measures in relation to unnatural optical radiation, but in order to call on the Commission to come up with a proposal that would be credible in terms of the Constitution and of Lisbon. President Barroso and his colleagues always get carried away when analysing the reasons why the Constitution was rejected, and regularly invoke the Lisbon objectives. If you put them on the spot on the subject of regulation and directives, the line they take is: ‘the sunshine directive? I was not in office at the time’. At the same time, though, there is no shortage of officials in the Commission who quite simply ignore whatever their bosses say. Better regulation? Of what interest is that to those to whom the protection of consumers is entrusted, those who are supposed to take action to deal with this? For them, it is ‘business as usual’. In Germany, this is not an issue for only one end of the political spectrum; I would just like to remind Mrs Jöns of the President of the German Council of Cities. This may have passed her by during the summer recess, but, in any case, the President of the German Council of Cities, who is also at the same time the Lord Mayor of Munich, and, as she will be aware, a member of the SPD, has held up the sunshine directive to ridicule. We see, then, that there is in Germany a broad political consensus to the effect that we are in favour of rules that are practicable. The compromise would take us closer to them. The motion for rejection calls upon the Commission to come up with something better; if it is not passed, I call upon you to at least support the compromise motion.

 Mr President, Mr Trichet, Commissioner Almunia, I would like to start by thanking you, Mr Trichet, for your work over the past year. At a time when the Stability and Growth Pact has been under fire, you contended in splendid fashion for the stability of the euro, facing down the Member States, the Council and the Commission too. For that you have the warm thanks of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which wishes to encourage you to keep on doing the same thing, for things are not getting any easier. The Stability Pact was softened up, loosened up, or – according to some – abolished; that is something on which I do not propose to comment right now. We are, of course, currently seeing to what extent it is applied, and what effect it has, in Italy, and there are doubts in some people’s minds about that. What has happened over recent months has not, though, done away with the risk of inflation, which has, on the contrary, increased. To Mrs Wagenknecht, who seems, unfortunately, to have a more pressing appointment to go to, and who spoke of ‘new poverty’, I would say that real poverty is present when money loses its value. As you, Mr Trichet, said, we should, in future, take constant care to require the reforms at national level, which are so necessary. I would have liked the Commission to respond appropriately when your own country’s Mr de Villepin proposed the eventual establishment, alongside the ECB, of an economic and financial government, which would be responsible for both economic growth and job creation. This is the logical second step. The first was to fundamentally change the Stability and Growth Pact or do away with it altogether, and the second step, now, is to give the European Central Bank equal responsibility for both price stability and other measures, not least for economic growth and job creation. I can do no other than warn of the need for the nation states to do their homework, for the most irresponsible thing we can do at present – and it is something I hear from members of the other political group – is to suggest to people that there is no need for change, that no more than a different policy on the part of the ECB is needed, and that social standards can remain as they are. That is irresponsible, particularly as those who indulge in this sort of talk, are those who ought most to be aware of the fact that reforms at national level are more urgently needed than ever. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is perhaps symbolic that what may be the last debate before the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is taking place at this late hour. The Pact is being quietly laid to rest, well away from the public eye. Be that as it may, I should like to thank Mr Karas for his report, and for his attempt to formulate a position for Parliament that reconciles the views of the Council and the Commission. In my opinion, it says a lot that the Council can reach agreement on a further weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact at a time like this, when it cannot agree on a single important issue. This is all taking place at a time when the euro needs a stable framework and when our key objective should be to avoid running up debts and thereby increasing inflation. Above all, it is a time when the Commission’s position must be strengthened. I therefore find it equally regrettable that the Commission has given its consent, as this means that nothing has been done about the Pact’s underlying problem, which is that those who violate it sit in judgment on themselves. The Council should have given its backing to attempts to flesh out somewhat the details of how its own decisions are to be monitored and interpreted, and the Commission should have supported such attempts accordingly. The first infringement proceedings against Italy will now make clear what approach the Commission services favour. All we can do is encourage them to continue the fight to achieve a solid framework for the euro and for the Pact governing the euro, which is our common currency, even if this means coming out in opposition to the Member States. Members of the previous Commission were prepared to do just that, and I would encourage you to continue fighting for the Pact and for the spirit that it formerly embodied.

Mr President, Commissioner, we have often debated the Stability Pact here in the past. I thank the rapporteur for his report, which has built on the Council decision and finished the job, although I cannot hide the fact – and I say so directly – that I am not happy with the Council decision. The precondition to a Stability and Growth Pact in an area with a single currency is that budgetary policies should converge, that they should not diverge too greatly. What is ultimately at stake is nothing other than the viability of our currency. We have had enough material for discussion over recent days about the views that many, including many in positions of political responsibility, take of this and, where possible, debates in previous months also made a further contribution. We expect the Commission – as the rapporteur said – to set out exactly how the Council decision will be interpreted through the regulations in the future. What is meant by a ‘slight excess’ or a ‘temporary’ one? Which ranges will be accepted by the Commission in future? I hope and wait for the Commission to be strict here and we shall soon see how – with one eye on Italy – it approaches the new Pact and if it is worth the paper it is written on. I hope for the necessary strictness here. I also hope that the Commission will always put its finger on the actual problems. Making correlations of this kind between unemployment and the Stability Pact is typical of the cheap policy being pursued in the nation states, and so we should not be surprised if a majority of people believed in the referenda what the nation states convey in Brussels: that the euro is responsible for unemployment and it would be best to get rid of it. The Commission has a huge responsibility not to give into these cheap arguments by the nation states and, if it comes down to it, to draw the necessary conclusions, take recourse to the Court of Justice where necessary and fight for the euro, a strong currency and the future, as did its predecessors. This regulation and the Council decision do not make your life any easier. You will have even more responsibility for it. I wish you luck with it.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her constructive and good cooperation. She has produced a balanced text that takes a look at the European internal financial market – to which, over recent years, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has devoted a great deal of attention – and, while doing a good job of analysing our present situation, also looks towards the future. To be sure, having had a great deluge of legislation, we must now consolidate; we must ensure not only that it is properly implemented, but also that we learn from our initial experience with it, and that we tackle the next legislative project piece by piece rather than with gusto, as we did before. We should also – contrary to what certain participants in the European market would like us to do – handle the topic of maximum harmonisation with a great deal of care. I can imagine those who currently write to us demanding maximum harmonisation in consumer protection matters saying – yet again – that we are taking harmonisation too far with the Consumer Credit Directive; that is why they should be very careful when calling for such a thing. This House has, for some time, been quite clear about where it stands on CESR; although we are in favour of the Lamfalussy procedure, we want transparency and participation, and there is a very, very great deal of room for more of that in CESR. Our expectation is that what happened with ‘Clearing and Settlement’ will not be allowed to recur. I also call on Commissioner McCreevy to apply the same sensitivity to pressing for international standards in a field in which international bodies keep introducing more and more standards for large companies, which are then applied by small and medium-sized enterprises as well. This is where democratic control is called for, and this is where the Commission and Parliament must join together in developing the institutions for this purpose. Let me end with a comment on European supervision. I regard the approach taken by ‘Basel 2’ – that of approaching this with very great care – to be the right one for a draft. We should take care not to be too hasty in creating a Europe-wide level playing field, thereby ignoring the regional and national level playing fields that we already have. The one must not wreck the other. That is why I favour a bottom up approach, so that, while focusing on European regulation and supervision, we build them up slowly, starting from the bottom. That this should be enforced from the top down is intolerable.
 Radwan (PPE-DE

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is done. We have had the summit, the Stability and Growth Pact was – as many are saying – reformed or – as others are saying – abolished, and an attack was launched on the services directive. Nothing more stands in the way of the prosperity and recovery of Europe. Now we shall manage it. That might be one message. I am grateful to you, Mr President of the Commission, for having said at the beginning of your speech that the discussion about the Stability Pact had been started because the consensus about compliance with the rules hitherto had broken down and there was therefore no choice but to do something new. Then the question arose as to how to go about it. In the meantime, there was talk of liars. I, in any event, do not feel uncomfortable dancing to the tune of the European Central Bank and the German Bundesbank when evaluating the Stability and Growth Pact. If you then also bear in mind that many states have threatened, in connection with further growth, to stop applying the law which applied hitherto, then I wonder if this is how things are going to be now. Will we, in future, be taking decisions of this sort in Europe? On the Lisbon Strategy, I should like to say that I hope for a strong Commission. I am aware of the fact, Mr President of the Commission, that it is harder for you than it was for Jacques Delors to realise a vision, because Jacques Delors had different Heads of Government at his side. At that time, he had Mitterrand and Kohl, who actively supported European progress. It is important for the Commission to concentrate on what Europe can achieve and not to produce too much paper. For the Council, it is important that the Member States commit to what they themselves regularly agree on and do their homework, so that we too can attain the goal. On the services directive, I have just one thing to say: we shall probably vote on Romania and Bulgaria this afternoon. To those who are up in arms against this directive in the Council, I should just like to say that we have problems with respect to freedom of services with the 10 states, because it was not included in the accession treaties. We should not repeat the same mistake now and take it out on others; on the contrary, freedom of services should be corrected in the Bulgaria and Romania concept in accordance with the will of those who are for it. Otherwise, we shall face the same problem.

 Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Jacques Delors is regarded as one of the most successful Presidents that the Commission has had, for it was he who had the vision of creating and completing the internal market. The Lisbon strategy could be this Commission’s vision. One difference, though, is that Jacques Delors was dealing with Heads of Government like Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand, who had their own visions and goals for Europe. With some of the Heads of Government that we have now, one could well ask, in a critical way, where Europe ranks in their list of priorities. That, Mr President of the Commission, is one of the fundamental priorities for you – to overcome that obstacle and let Lisbon become a reality, so that you do not end up saying, ‘I had a dream’, whilst nothing productive came out of it for us. That is what is crucial, and the Commission can contribute in various ways. Commissioner McCreevy, whom I see here, can, in his own field, do a great deal to that end. I hope that you will get your own way, despite the Member States, where the cause of Europe needs to be advanced. People in the Member States need to be told what those States are supposed to be doing. Transparency and comparability are at stake here. We are currently seeing a failure to apply the law as it stands in the case of the Stability and Growth Pact, and that leads me to suspect that progress reports will not be enough. Let us make very clear comparisons here, with benchmarking, in order to establish who, in Europe, has the best labour market policy. When handling the Lisbon strategy in future, we will have to take care that the economy, ecology and social objectives do not act against each other, but are instead all subordinated to the goals of the Lisbon strategy. When nation states implement it, it is even more important to ensure that lawmaking is improved. There are Member States – and I am from one of them – that manage over and over again to plug the gaps as required. The most important thing will be to encourage people in Europe, so that the goal of the Lisbon strategy can become reality. Our main problem is that there are elements in Europe that do not believe that we can hold our own against the Americans. If we do manage to do that, then we in Europe will have achieved a great deal. This House is right behind you.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we are discussing the Lisbon strategy and how Europe is intended to become the most competitive region in the world. We have not managed to achieve that over the last five years, and we have now identified the chief culprit: the Stability and Growth Pact! People are saying that if we scrap the pact Europe will be better off, because that will enable us to make better progress. I have not heard anyone talking about the homework that needs to be done at national level, and about where the real culprits are to be found – in the Member States. Germany even believes that it is worth making higher net payments to Europe in return for the abolition of the Stability and Growth Pact. Commissioner Almunia, your predecessor, the Spanish Socialist Mr Solbes, assured this House on several occasions that the Stability and Growth Pact is sufficiently flexible, and I am bound to agree with him. What I cannot accept is that we should keep the 3% and 60% criteria and then, as Chancellor Schröder has done, seek to have certain factors excluded in the run up to or even after the procedure. This is then sold to us under the Lisbon banner by saying that we no longer can or must take anything growth-intensive into account in the procedure from now on. It has to be taken into account. And Germany’s economists tell us that we will then end up with an 8% or 10% deficit. The appropriate sanctions are not being applied here. If we are to take Lisbon seriously, then we first have to take the Stability and Growth Pact seriously, and not use the argument that ten Member States are in breach of it. I would be delighted if speed limits were applied by saying that if you get caught too often by a speed trap, we will just raise the relevant speed limit so that not so many people are fined in future! Rules are there to be respected. We need to take the Lisbon strategy seriously. We need to take it seriously when framing EU legislation, so that in future every new directive is checked to see whether it conflicts with the Lisbon objectives or promotes them. The Member States need to make sure that they do not torpedo legislation on the internal market when it is inconvenient for them, and the Commission must take to task those Member States that are at fault. The Commission should introduce benchmarking and announce this in the clearest possible terms. We in Europe have to realise that the world is not flat and that we are engaged in global competition. We need to finally react to this so that people are aware we are taking this subject seriously.

 Mr President, I merely wish to inform the House that a meeting of the coordinators was held yesterday at which the coordinators of all parties, including the committee chairs, confirmed that the amendment just read out had been accepted, but had not, because of a drafting error, been included in the report. So in the interests of fairness we should vote on the amendment now.
 Radwan (PPE-DE

 Mr President, you were right to include Lisbon in your work programme – the Lisbon that is intended to make Europe the most competitive global region. I am sure everyone in this Chamber thinks we want to achieve that; the question now arises of how we do it. Some of it Europe can afford, and I would urge you to focus your work programme rather more on the self-employed and small businesses instead of solely on large-scale industries or on more innovative sectors; important though these certainly are, most businesses – truism though it is to say so – are small ones or one-man operations. Your programme does not, unfortunately, do justice to their importance. The other thing I want to say is that you have to monitor the Member States in this respect and point out when they have to implement the necessary reforms. I have high expectations of the Commission actually doing that, but I have to say that, having first vowed to stand up to the Council, the Commission gave up even before embarking on its first contest with them. That brings me to the Stability and Growth Pact. Look at your Commission and the Commissioner with responsibility for these matters; it is apparent to me from the statements he makes that all he is doing is picking the Council’s proposals to pieces. Where the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, I think back to the time when Mr Juncker joined us in Committee and said: ‘You have to learn’. He was right: politicians, too, have to learn. The problem with the Pact is that it is those who offend against it – the finance ministers – who decide among themselves whether or not the Pact is to apply. You ought to fight to have the Commission given greater power in this area. In the areas we are discussing, though, it is unfortunate that the Commission is not doing that, but simply walking behind the Council and making life even easier for it. This is where Mr Solbes was a good example of the sort of commitment required, and a good yardstick by which to measure it. Let me, in addition, urge you not to indulge in the Prodi Commission’s obstructive tactics, for the Commissioners at the time, who played a part in them, had their work cut out – Mrs Wallström, who is here today, spent five years helping to make Europe the most competitive area. Judge by the results, and, if you do not make a quick job of putting a stop to bureaucracy, you will end up the same way as the Prodi Commission.

 Mr President, it is perhaps a sign that I am speaking on the Lisbon strategy when the member of the Commission with responsibility for development aid is present. Although there is no argument about the fact that the goal of making Europe the world’s most competitive region is the right one, we have to look to see who, in Europe, is responsible for what, and I can tell Mr Balkenende that it is when I look at the Council that I find it intolerable that, every month and every year, heads of government and ministers of the economy meet together, agree upon exalted objectives, make Europe responsible for meeting the goals of the Lisbon strategy, then go home and fail to do their homework when they get there. Indeed, they go even further and stand in the way of those things that Europe has to contribute. Take, for example, the European patent: that would be a step ahead as part of a European initiative. Think of the moves towards deregulation, and how the French President and the German Chancellor delayed them for end-users. What Europe achieves is frustrated in the Council, and what ought to be done by the nation states does not get done. The bottom line is that it is Europe that fails to make a success of the Lisbon strategy. I am grateful for the Kok report; what we now urgently need – as the Lisbon strategy is the right one – is an orientation for it. The goal, although perhaps too ambitiously defined, is the right one. With Member States like ours in Europe, we can now be happy that the gap between us and America is not widening. We have to put forward a concept for this in Europe, one that compares the nation states, providing a transparent view of which European government is failing to implement this strategy and which is good at it, in order, by way of this transparency in the political process, to make the public aware that we cannot do this other than together. Apart from that, I hope that the presence of the Commissioner with responsibility for development aid is not an indication of the direction in which Europe will be drifting in future.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start my speech with thanks to you, Mr Trichet, and thereby emphasise that, for us in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, your institution now stands for a stable euro – not only for low inflation, but also for adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact. That has, in particular, become apparent in the events of recent months, in which the euro’s problem has been with the Finance ministers, and in which some of us in the European Parliament have seen with great sorrow the Commission’s failure to take a stand in the way, and with the clarity, that you have done today in this House with regard to how the Stability Pact is to be handled. It is in fact you who guarantee the Stability Pact in the euro zone! Here, I am referring in particular to the example of Greece, where we need Europe to exert tighter control, something that I hear said, alas, all too infrequently, even today. I could, for example, imagine a future reversal of the burden of proof, so that the Commission and Eurostat would have to critically examine whether the figures are plausible, and, if they were not, new ones could be called for. Otherwise they would not be regarded as having been reported. That would be a first step, and we expect to have to debate and decide, within the life of this Parliament, whether more currencies are to be added. Let me put this question, not only to Eurostat and the Commission, but also to the ECB: do you work on the basis that the figures presented to you are correct? I find it intolerable that it has to date been impossible to give an answer as to whether or not the figures as submitted are accurate. Let me just briefly turn to what you had to say about the CESR. What is wrong with this process is that the authorities at nation state level are already presenting us with faits accomplis
, 
and that it is becoming ever more difficult for the legal system to circumvent this and arrive at redefinitions. We ask you to see to it that these regulators do not lack a legal basis on which to act.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, two or three years ago your predecessor, fellow countryman and party colleague, Mr Solbes, spoke before this House and responded to Mr Prodi’s comments, which have been quoted a number of times today already. The Pact is sufficiently flexible and does not need to be changed. The question we must therefore now ask ourselves is why, two years later, there is a sudden demand for change – one that may appear different, but comes from the same family of parties. The way I see it, it is to your credit that you are undertaking a final rescue bid for the Pact, because what has become apparent is quite simply that the finance ministers, in particular the German and French finance ministers, may create European legislation, but do not abide by it. I remember how Mr Zalm, the Finance Minister, addressed our committee and, amongst other things, called for everyone to be treated equally. I would like to stress this point; everyone must be treated equally, and the law applies to everyone. I also welcome the fact that you do not wish to amend the Treaties and that there will be no change to the figures of 3% and 60%. You spoke of flexibility, and indeed there are good economic reasons for flexibility. I would, however, like to make it quite clear that these reasons must be specified. In this instance flexibility appears to be a license for anyone with a few national peculiarities to ask to have these taken into account, and the Commission hands them what they want on a plate. The Commission must make improvements in this respect and elaborate on the relevant details. What I find particularly regrettable is that even the Commission is not addressing the problems relating to the Pact, and you need to have a better procedure for dealing with them. If you tell governments that they must make savings and reduce debt when better times arrive, I do not believe that they will suddenly do so merely because the Commission tells them to, but because they want to make good on their election promises when the income situation improves. This, then, is where the Commission’s role must be strengthened vis-à-vis the Council on this issue. The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in this House support you, and I hope that at least some of the finance ministers do too. Let me conclude with one final comment; the Stability and Growth Pact should not be blamed already for the likely potential failure of the Lisbon Strategy, which is the fault of national governments. That would amount to myth making, which should not be allowed under any circumstances. (Applause)

 The European social models are facing major challenges during the current financial crisis. The German conservative group (CDU/CSU) is therefore speaking out in favour of a social Europe. For this reason, we endorse Mr Silva Peneda’s report on the Renewed Social Agenda. We also welcome both the fact that job creation and promotion are being accorded priority in this time of crisis and our willingness to press ahead with measures relating to education and training. Europe must create a social framework and establish standards at a European level. We must certainly take into account the competences of Member States in that regard. For this reason, we oppose the blanket call for the introduction of a minimum wage in all the Member States, as originally expressed in paragraph 14 of the report. The introduction of a minimum wage is a decision which should be left to the sole discretion of Member States. We are, therefore, pleased that the oral amendment to this paragraph has been adopted. Sufficient benefits must be ensured to enable every person to lead a dignified life, but different options are available to Member States in this regard. We have made it clear in our oral amendment that, in addition to the minimum wage, consideration should also be given to collective agreements and generally binding regulations, or a state-guaranteed minimum income. In this way, we pay due regard to the principle of subsidiarity.
 Anja Weisgerber  (PPE-DE
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, the European social models face great challenges. In particular against the backdrop of the current financial crisis, measures at European level must be coordinated. I would therefore also like to thank the rapporteurs very much for their excellent work. Not only must we take immediate measures to regulate the financial market, we must also coordinate socio­political measures and create a social framework. Here we should also bear in mind the competences of the Member States. I am in favour of giving priority to creating and boosting employment at this time of crisis and also of pressing ahead with the realisation of the flexicurity principle. However, I refuse to accept the demand for the introduction of minimum wages in all Member States, as called for in paragraph 14 of the report by Mr Silva Peneda, whom I would otherwise like to thank for his work. This demand, which relates to a decision that should be left to the sole discretion of Member States, infringes the principle of subsidiarity. Labour market regulations and systems vary greatly from one Member State to another. In my opinion, every person must be guaranteed sufficient income to be able to lead a decent life. This can be achieved through a minimum income with the help of additional state social benefits. What level would the minimum wage be pegged at? At the Romanian level perhaps? There it is around EUR 72 a month. I particularly support the idea that we must secure a basic income for everyone, but I refer back to Member States’ competences for establishing appropriate limits. I declare myself in favour of a social Europe. Europe must create a social framework, but at the same time consider the powers of the Member States.

 Mr President, we, the German conservative group (CDU/CSU), voted against Mrs Buitenweg’s report. We oppose discrimination of all kinds, but we do not believe that a comprehensive framework directive at European level is really the right way to protect those affected. Ten Member States have still not transposed the existing anti-discrimination directive at all. Despite that, a simple majority of this House – not a qualified majority – did vote in favour of this extension today. It would give rise to considerable additional bureaucracy and unnecessary costs – something that the public has little understanding for. Improvements can be made in relation to insurance and in the structural adaptation measures relating to disabled entrances, and the requirement for a law on class actions could be eliminated, but we foresee serious problems for the Member States if, for example, we were forced to include the concept ‘belief’ in the prohibited grounds for discrimination. The consequence of this would be that extremists and sects, such as Scientology, for example, would be able to invoke the protection of the directive. We are also opposed to granting complete equivalence of status to traditional and same-sex marriages. In the Commission’s view, the transposal of the directive requires that same-sex partners, insofar as they may be legally recognised in a given Member State, should also receive the same rights as married couples. We are opposed to that idea. We therefore voted against the report and in favour of referring the proposal back to the Commission.

Madam President, the regulation on novel foods brings harmonisation of the approval and use of these novel foods and ingredients to the European Union. That is an important step for a comprehensive guarantee of food safety. Without this regulation, we would have had no control over and no restrictions on approvals. We have ensured in this regulation that there are strict criteria which serve consumer protection. In granting approvals, the European Food Safety Authority will ultimately decide on the safety of novel foods, thereby giving us harmonisation throughout Europe. In addition to safety concerns, ethical questions in relation to novel foods are also very important. This includes the question of avoiding animal testing or preventing the use of cloned foods. I therefore welcome the fact that these ethical aspects are taken into account during approval. We wanted an opinion by the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies to be taken into account where there are ethical reservations. I am grateful that this was included and I was therefore able to vote in favour of the report as a whole.

 Mr President, I very much welcome the central element of the Krahmer report, the European safety network. Maximum emissions limits are being laid down which the Member States must adhere to as an absolute top limit when granting permits to large industrial plants. There is, then, a rough framework, so that everything moves flexibly and so that there is a level playing field. This will put a stop to the inflationary use of derogations that has thus far taken place in certain Member States. This means competition on an equal footing throughout Europe. In that way, we can together establish a high standard at the European level. I must make it clear, though, that I vehemently reject the regulations on soil protection. I am of the opinion that more account should be taken of the subsidiarity principle. Regulations on soil protection have no cross-border effect. Soil protection is not a cross-border issue. I therefore continue to believe that the Member States can regulate soil protection themselves. There is an attempt here, however, to use the IPPC Directive as a back door through which to bring in parts of the soil protection directive, which we successfully fought off in the past. I very much regret that my motions to delete the relevant parts were rejected by a very narrow majority, in one case by only six votes. I have therefore decided to vote against this report as a whole, despite the fact that I very much welcome the European safety network.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of our society and provide 67% of European private sector jobs. Therefore, I very much welcome the ‘Think Small First’ initiative and am committed to ensuring that this principle is taken into account in policymaking at all political and administrative levels. Particularly at this time of financial crisis it is important to create a genuine, tangible added value for SMEs, in order to strengthen these enterprises as a stabilising factor in the crisis. As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I was involved in formulating the ideas that are now to be voted on. Numerous proposals of mine have been incorporated into the text, including the importance of the principle of flexicurity. This concept should create flexible labour markets that are also in line with a high level of employment security. My call for labour law to provide a reliable basis for SMEs has also been incorporated. SMEs often cannot afford their own legal or human resources departments and are therefore dependent on simple, clear regulations. One of my most important demands – the ‘SME test’ for legislative initiatives – also gained the support of the committee responsible. Bureaucracy must be nipped in the bud. Impact assessments are to be carried out systematically in the case of new laws. Before their adoption, all EU provisions must be examined in terms of their impact on SMEs. It is important to me that the results of this SME test be subject to an independent evaluation by an independent body, and this idea has been incorporated into the text. SMEs face particular challenges in the context of the global financial crisis, and so I particularly welcome the report’s call for the proposals of Mr Stoiber’s High-Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens to be implemented as quickly as possible. We must act quickly to take advantage of this potential.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will vote on new regulations on the subject of plant protection, a subject that arouses a great deal of emotion in the populace. This was also reflected in the deliberations in Parliament. We would all like fresh, healthy, local food at affordable prices without hazardous residues from plant protection products. The result achieved in the trialogue will create the preconditions for this. The new Plant Protection Regulation is a great step towards more consumer and health protection. Priority was given once more to scientific criteria rather than political dogmas when establishing the exemption criteria. The result of the trialogue is a giant step forward compared to the result of our Parliament at the first reading. Almost 80% of all active substances will no longer be affected but only those that constitute a risk to human health or the environment, and this is on a scientific basis. There will also be sufficient plant protection products available for sustainable management in the future. However, substances that are really hazardous will also be banned. In future, there will no longer be 27 national licensing authorities but only 3 licensing zones for licensing plant protection products. The Member States within these zones must then mutually acknowledge their licences in principle. The new Plant Protection Product Regulation will provide the harmonisation required for a long time with justification in the plant protection product sector. We will then have a uniformly high level of protection without jeopardising sustainable agricultural production within Europe. We will now achieve a real internal market, uniform competitive conditions and a great deal of progress towards health protection. This is wonderful success for consumers and farmers. Thank you very much.

 Mr President, the principle that the entirety of on-call time is to be considered working time must hold; I agree with the rapporteur on this. I believe that the common position must be amended in this respect. The common position even envisages the possibility of considering the inactive part of on-call time to be a rest period. This could lead to marathons of 72 hours and more on duty, which should not be allowed in any Member State. Therefore, I welcome the committee’s adoption of my amendments in this regard. I would ask you to bear in mind, however, that the Working Time Directive applies not only to doctors but also to a wide variety of other professions, and on-call duty keeps workers occupied to a widely varying degree. For example, it also covers fire-fighters, who can sleep or even engage in recreational activities while on call. The fire-fighters are therefore arguing for the option of derogating from the maximum working week. Therefore, I advocate the option of seeking tailor-made solutions on site by means of collective – not individual – opt-outs. Practice-oriented collective agreements have been negotiated on this by the parties to such agreements in the past. I expressly support such a strengthening of free collective bargaining. In addition, the new, collective opt-out is significantly more worker friendly than the existing regime. Opt-outs are possible only with the consent of the worker concerned, and this consent must not be given in conjunction with the employment contract. If we vote against this option of collective agreements, we run the risk that there will be no revision of the Working Time Directive at all, and we also jeopardise the chances of worker-friendly opt-outs. Therefore, I shall be voting against the amendments seeking to delete the opt-out, as I am in favour of such free collective bargaining and of tailor-made solutions on site.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to offer my heartfelt thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Groote, and the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation. Their help made it possible for an agreement to be reached about a very technical dossier as early as the first reading stage. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I still recall very well our vote on the revision of the fine particulates directive. I was a shadow rapporteur then, too. On that occasion, we managed to get the Commission to sign a declaration in which it undertook to put forward measures that combat fine particulate matter at the very point at which it occurs. The new Euro VI regulation for heavy-duty vehicles and buses is one of the measures we have been calling for. The regulation combats fine particulates right from their emission – at the source, in other words, which is where the particulates are actually produced. The new Euro VI standard will thus reduce emissions of fine particulates from diesel heavy-duty vehicles and buses by 66% as compared with the Euro V standard, while in petrol-driven vehicles nitrogen (NOx
) emissions will be reduced by a further 80%. In order for it to be possible to actually achieve these new, ambitious emissions standards, the implementing measures, which lay down the exact technical specifics in detail, must be made public at an early stage. For that reason I am also, of course, very pleased about the declaration that Commissioner Verheugen has just made, in which the Commission undertakes to put the implementing measures forward to Parliament and the Council very quickly – more quickly than was originally planned. The point about access to repair and maintenance information for independent market operators is also something I find important. Independent market operators means independent workshops, motoring organisations and breakdown rescue services. If we want to ensure functional competition in the field of repair work we must guarantee this access, and in this regulation we have managed to achieve that. That is good for competition, for the price of repair work, for road safety and for consumers.

 Madam President, this morning I voted with some hesitation in favour of the report by Neil Parish on the creation of a single market organisation for a wide range of different agricultural products. I welcome the Commission's objective of simplifying European agricultural policy. This means that in future there will only be one market organisation which will replace the 21 existing market organisations, for example, for fruit, vegetables, milk and wine. However, the administration of the resulting highly complex document must be made as simple as possible. For this reason, I am very pleased that the Commission gave the assurance in yesterday's debate that it will take up my idea and include in the EUR-Lex European search engine the functionality to allow users to access only the articles which relate to their specific agricultural product. The Commission has also confirmed that the wine market organisation, which was negotiated with some difficulty and which includes many of Parliament's requirements, will remain unchanged. It is only for this reason that I felt able to vote in favour of the report.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the Zimmer report but nonetheless wish to endorse wholeheartedly the report’s objective of promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, including child poverty, in the European Union. I expressly welcome an approach which advocates adequate minimum income schemes as the basic prerequisite for a life lived in dignity. This principle must apply to people in work and the unemployed. What I cannot do, however, is vote in favour of a report which repeatedly urges the Member States to introduce minimum wages, and which calls on the Council to agree an EU target for minimum wages. This demand violates the subsidiarity principle and the Member States’ fundamental competence in the field of social legislation. The report also explicitly welcomes the Commission’s proposal for a horizontal directive covering all forms of discrimination. I am opposed to discrimination, but I believe that this is the wrong approach.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fossil fuels are finite. Demand is increasing, pushing prices up – we see that every day at the petrol station. The expectation that oil, natural gas and coal will run out in the future is one reason for the rising prices. Therefore, we need to start immediately to investigate technologies that could replace fossil fuels in the future. One of these alternatives – and the Commissioner quite rightly emphasised that it is only one, but it is an alternative – is hydrogen technology. Naturally, hydrogen vehicles are not yet ready for the market, but a variety of projects are under way to change that. The EU ‘highways’ project has just been completed, with an encouraging report. EU research ministers set up a long-term public-private partnership in February with the aim of getting hydrogen and fuel-cell technology ready for the market between 2015 and 2025. It is planned to invest a total of approximately EUR 940 million in this research programme in the next few years, with public authorities and private investors contributing half each. We see that the stage is set for hydrogen vehicles to be ready for the market. The fact that the price of fuel cells is still high cannot be used as an argument against hydrogen technology, as that is the way with all technologies of the future. The first 0.5 megapixel digital camera was developed many years ago for space travel and cost around EUR 10 million, but nowadays, almost everyone has a digital camera. The present regulation will, in the future, provide harmonised technical regulations for the approval of hydrogen powered vehicles throughout Europe for the first time. Unified criteria are essential if this technology is to be promoted and a high level of safety and environmental protection maintained. Hydrogen powered vehicles are not included in the EC type-approval system at present, so Member States can issue one-off permits for this type of vehicle. This is done in some Member States, but in others it is completely unknown. With permits being issued in this way, there is a risk that each Member State will set its own permit conditions and the internal market will be disrupted. This would lead to high costs for manufacturers as well as to safety risks. Hydrogen is one of the energy vectors of the future. Therefore, our task, which we are fulfilling by adopting this regulation, is to establish the political framework conditions for the use of this technology of the future by creating unified approval criteria. I am glad that, across the parties, we have managed to achieve agreement at first reading, and that the cooperation with the Council and the Commission was so good. My thanks for the excellent cooperation go therefore to the shadow rapporteurs; I would also like to mention Mr Bulfon and Mr Manders by name. That is what made agreement at first reading possible. Our focus was on the issue of labelling hydrogen powered vehicles. Hydrogen powered vehicles are just as safe as passenger cars powered by diesel or petrol. Under the regulation, they will have to pass safety tests that are just as strict as those for all other vehicles. However, it makes sense for rescue services to know if they are dealing with a hydrogen vehicle when they arrive at the scene of an accident, so that they can take certain details into account. This should not mean that hydrogen powered vehicles are viewed adversely because, as I have already said, they are just as safe as vehicles that run on other fuels. That is a very important point that I want to get across today. We therefore suggest that hydrogen vehicles should bear discreet labels on the components that contain hydrogen. Working with the Commission and the Council, we made further improvements to the Commission’s text and substituted ‘identification’ for the word ‘label’, because in the long term, this label should and could be replaced by electronic identification that involves an intelligent emergency call system called ‘eCall’. Other questions also arose. At the end, perhaps, I will return briefly to the question of hydrogen filling station infrastructure but for now, I am looking forward to the lively discussion and am eager to hear what you have to say.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the very interesting speeches. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission, the representatives of the Council and the staff for their fantastic cooperation, which was the key to achieving this political unity at first reading. As we have seen, hydrogen is a technology of the future. Hydrogen can be part of the answer to the challenges posed by climate change and the need to reduce emissions. It is a clean alternative to fossil fuels and the use of hydrogen as an energy vector – as has been stated, it is indeed an energy vector – is totally sustainable if it is produced from renewable energies or nuclear energy. This is the direction we have to take in the coming years. I am fascinated by the idea of having a totally hazard-free hydrogen cycle in which hydrogen is ultimately produced from renewable energies and then vaporised. It is truly fascinating. I supported this technology long before I came to the European Parliament, and have also worked voluntarily on it for a long time. Today we have set things going in the right direction. We have created the necessary preconditions so that we can eventually have unified type-approval regulations. We have also shown the way to an international type-approval regulation and set the future direction for research and development. The technology is already here, as Commissioner Verheugen has rightly said. Now we must deal with the other questions relating to infrastructure. The question of filling station infrastructure will be handled by a public-private partnership. Perhaps then we will find that it will not be long before hydrogen powered vehicles are on our streets, and not just as prototypes. Thank you once again for the good cooperation.

Mr President, Europe is more than a common market. Besides being an economic entity, Europe is a community based on common values. I understand the European Union as a response to globalisation. In a globalised world, a certain social framework at European level provides essential protection. That is the idea behind the European social model, and it is an idea that I support. On the other hand, however, we must also succeed in international competition. In the Lisbon Strategy we emphasise our goal of developing the Union into the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economic framework. To that end we must focus most of our attention on small and medium-sized businesses, for they are the pillar of economic development. We must also accept that it is legitimate to ask how our rules affect these firms. The anti-discrimination policy is a good example. It goes without saying that I am opposed to discrimination, but in my view, and in the view of another 261 Members of the European Parliament, a comprehensive framework directive is not the right way forward; in particular, it is not the right way to protect the victims. We shall achieve the exact opposite and are more likely to marginalise these people. A great deal of legal uncertainty has been created for the Member States and for European citizens. At the present time, numerous Treaty infringement proceedings are pending against 14 Member States for failure to implement the four existing directives. The first thing we should be doing is to implement the existing legislation before creating any new rules. A new anti-discrimination directive will simply not give us the clarity that Commissioner Špidla promised. The new rules raise many questions. Who, for example, can invoke the right to freedom from discrimination on grounds of religious or ideological beliefs? Does that right extend to Scientologists or members of right-wing extremist groups? Is every restaurant, however small, now required to have a wheelchair ramp in order to guarantee unhindered access? The draft directive may provide for exemption from disproportionate measures, but how are such measures to be defined – by a national law or by a court ruling? Imprecise, amorphous instruments like the framework directive are impractical and, most importantly, do not help victims. That is not the idea behind the European social model. It will not work like that.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to all the rapporteurs, especially Mrs Drčar Murko and Mrs Ayuso, for their constructive cooperation and trust. The Food Improvement Agents package will lead to uniform, harmonised rules on the use of additives becoming applicable throughout Europe. In the future, too, when additives, enzymes and flavourings are used in food, there will be a high level of consumer health protection – which is the way it should be. The package adapts the current legislation to the technical and scientific developments in the area of food additives. Where there is a scientific basis that indicates health risks, threshold values must be set so as to prevent all hazards. However, we must not become hysterical or incite unwarranted panic. There are food additives such as konjac, a humectant, and beeswax, an anti-caking agent, which have been used in the preparation of food and drink for centuries. In addition, certain stone fruits such as cherries, peaches and apricots naturally contain small amounts of hydrocyanic acid, yet we have been eating these fruits for thousands of years without any problems. Similarly, some herbs and spices naturally contain substances which, in high concentrations, can cause health problems. Yet we have been using herbs and spices such as basil, tarragon and nutmeg in the preparation of our food since the year dot without any problems, but only in small, safe doses, of course. I therefore welcome the compromise in the new Regulation on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods. Where there is no cause for concern, exceptions are made to the threshold values, although only when exclusively fresh or dried herbs are used for food preparation. This way, we promote the use of natural products and natural ingredients, so that recipes with thousands of years of history, such as Italian pesto, will be maintained into the future.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all agreed on one thing: we are against any form of discrimination. I should like to clarify this right at the outset. However, there are different approaches to reaching this objective. I am of the opinion that protection against discrimination cannot conclusively be better regulated at European level than at national level. Here, too, we are expected to comply with the principle of subsidiarity. Many areas of life are currently regulated by EU anti-discrimination regulations. Four anti-discrimination directives have been adopted in recent years: the Race Directive, the Employment Directive, the Equal Treatment Directive and the Gender Directive. A multitude of infringement proceedings are currently in progress against Member States on account of problems in transposing the Treaty. Strictly speaking, they are even now in progress against 20 countries, that is three quarters of the EU Member States. It appears there is considerable legal uncertainty here. A new, broad and over-simplifying approach in the form of a framework directive is the wrong response to the legal uncertainties that exist here. The current problems first have to be examined before the Commission proposes new directives. Otherwise, the result otherwise will be more bureaucracy, more costs to citizens and less legal clarity, which benefits no one, particularly not the fight against discrimination. For this reason I, like my group, am against the articles in the Lynne report that call for a framework directive, a horizontal directive. If the other groups assert themselves, however, and the demand for a framework directive persists, I see myself being forced to vote against the report, not because I am against protecting against discrimination, but because a framework directive at European level is the wrong way, in my opinion. In the field of disability, all Member States as well as the European Community have signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Here we must and shall fulfil our obligations. We shall not, however, help anyone by adopting yet another unclear and wishy-washy framework directive.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are able to adopt the goods package at first reading speaks volumes for the excellent cooperation that has taken place within the European Parliament as well as between Parliament and the Council. This is an important legislative project, both for those involved in trade and, more especially, for consumers. Through this package we are removing obstacles to trade that have resulted from differing technical rules in the Member States. At the same time we are guaranteeing the quality of the products that are traded on the European market. The new legislation will ensure that products which do not comply with EU law or which are unsafe are quickly removed from the market or do not reach the market in the first place. Dangerous products are to be reported to the Commission without delay so that they can be taken out of circulation in all member countries. Cooperation with countries outside the EU – one need only think of China – will be improved under the Regulation by measures such as joint programmes and exchanges of technical expertise. Through these new provisions, we are ensuring efficient market surveillance and better scrutiny throughout Europe. That, after all, is what really counts. In all our discussions and negotiations we focused primarily on the consumer. The CE mark, for example, signifies the manufacturer’s compliance with European requirements for the product in question. Now, however, importers are to bear a greater share of responsibility alongside manufacturers. In particular, false or misleading CE marks are prohibited, and those who use them will face criminal prosecution in the Member States. All of this protects consumers, but it also safeguards honest entrepreneurs who observe all the rules. One of our main successes has been the preservation of the tried and tested national safety marks such as the German ‘GS’ symbol. Consumers are familiar with these marks and trust them. On Thursday we shall adopt a set of rules that promotes trade in goods in the internal market to best effect while at the same time – and this is so important – protecting consumers by means of better surveillance.

Madam President, today’s vote on the reform of the wine market is a resounding success for the European Parliament and for the various vine-growing regions and wine producers. For example, we were able to ensure that it will remain permissible to enrich wines with sucrose. Parliament also rejected the Commission’s plans to enact provisions at this stage prescribing the lifting of the ban on new planting in 2014. In this case we proposed a practicable solution whereby the decision on liberalisation would not be taken until a study had been presented in 2012. With regard to the labelling of individual wines, we also reached an agreement that takes due account of the various designation systems used in Europe. We succeeded, moreover, in incorporating a safeguard into the wine-market regulations which protects the Bocksbeutel
, the specially shaped bottles used in my home region of Franconia. Ladies and gentlemen, we have presented a very balanced framework today which will be a good basis for the forthcoming negotiations in the Council. The ball is now in the Council’s court; we in Parliament have performed our task and performed it very well.

Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, and the shadow rapporteurs for their effective cooperation. Agreement with the Council at second reading is a success for the European Parliament. This agreement is a major step towards better air quality in Europe. However, we do need the assistance of all those involved. The cities and towns have to draw up clean air plans and create environmental zones, for example, if they do not keep to the limits. The Member States have to create the conditions for this – such as the enactment of the regulation on motor vehicle stickers in Germany, for example. However, this is also called for in Europe. Only about 20-30% of air-borne soot particles come from inner-city traffic. It is only here, however, that the local authorities are able ultimately to have any influence. Local authorities have no chance of keeping to the limits if measures are not taken at European level to reduce emissions from sources other than transport. The measurement of emissions alone does not improve air quality. We need measures that combat the discharge of fine dust directly at source. This will provide genuine health protection. The Commission has now also committed itself politically to taking these steps. It wants to make legislative proposals, such as the Euro 6 standard for lorries (which ultimately also leads to the compulsory introduction of soot particle filters), emission standards for smaller industrial installations and new regulations for ship’s engines. The local authorities’ measures must be flanked by these regulations in order to achieve a genuine improvement in air quality. Firstly, there will be limits for the smallest dust particles. These particles are more harmful to human health because they can be breathed in. We therefore have to assess this. Through ambitious, yet realistic values we are sending out another signal for health protection. The legislator has demonstrated a sense of proportion here and at the same time ensured a high degree of health protection. Since we as Parliament have been able to achieve a good result on the smallest dust particles, we have accepted the Council’s position not to change anything in the existing PM10
 limits, including in daily limits. This also means, however, that there is no tightening of the annual PM10
 limits. The text of the Directive makes it explicitly clear that the local authorities are not obliged to take ineffective short-term measures such as road blocks, for example. The focus should be on long-term, sustainable measures such as environmental zones. Local authorities are already doing a great deal here and they should continue to do so. Cities and towns, however, can in future apply for an extension to the deadline for meeting the existing PM10
 limits under strict conditions. This means, however – and I deliberately wish to emphasise this – no free ticket for local authorities. They cannot exceed the limits indefinitely and they can obtain a deadline extension only under two strict conditions: that they are suffering from unfavourable climatic conditions or unfavourable field conditions such as hot spots, for example, and they have taken all appropriate and reasonable measures at local level. This flexibility for local authorities contributes to the Directive’s practicability, without disregarding the level of health protection. Ladies and gentlemen, we have put forward a responsible package. We have achieved progress on the health protection front.

Mr President, I voted to reject the Commission’s proposal. The proposal breaches the principle of subsidiarity. Soil has no cross-border aspects, which is why this matter can be regulated equally well or even better in the Member States than at European level. Many countries already have soil protection legislation. The Commission’s proposal takes scant account of that. In the final vote I also voted against the report and most of the compromises, although I do believe that the report adopted by Parliament is a marked improvement on the Commission’s proposal. There were improvements, for example, with regard to the identification of potentially contaminated sites. The redraft offers greater flexibility in the application of the criteria enumerated in Annex II. In general, however, there are still many provisions that make this directive an elaborate bureaucratic and expensive instrument. One good thing is that the criteria listed in Annex I will at least be non-binding now. Another is that the directive recognises the special character of agricultural land use. The cons outweigh the pros, however. On the question of funding, for example, we ought to have spelled out more clearly that the Soil Protection Directive will have no impact on the Community budget and that no new funds will be set up to implement the directive. Only the existing support mechanisms are to be used. For these reasons I have voted against the directive, and I hope that the Council will now make the necessary corrections.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the statistics on the consequences of smoking speak for themselves. Mr Florenz is right not to tire of pointing out that 650 000 deaths due to active smoking and 80 000 deaths due to passive smoking cost our health system EUR 50 million every year. There should be no need for us Parliamentarians to discuss effective protection for non-smokers. Therefore, the discussion is not about ‘whether’, but ‘how’ it can be effected. There are several different models of effective protection for non-smokers in Europe. Some countries, such as Sweden and Ireland, have imposed a strict ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and pubs, and in public buildings; others have provided for narrow exemptions. We should respect these different models. In principle, therefore, I think that protection of non-smokers is a matter for the Member States. The rapporteur proposes that Europe should intervene in the event that Member States fail to provide effective protection of non-smokers in the workplace. However, where these rules are infringed, I favour the EU keeping to the framework of EU powers regarding occupational safety and health. I also advocate recognition of the existing rules in the Member States. Functioning, existing national rules in the area of protection of non-smokers must be able to be retained. Member States that are well along the way should be rewarded; we need to recognise the effort they have made. We should take national differences and regional distinctiveness into account on a case by case basis, and accept them. However, this must still ensure sufficient special protection for children and young people, and for non-smokers. We do not want to water down the protection of non-smokers. This will achieve a high level of health protection while adhering to the principle of subsidiarity and respecting the interests and regional differences of Member States.

Mr President, as draftswoman of my Committee’s opinion for the Breyer report concerning the Regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market, I should like to comment on the proposal. In this proposal for a regulation, it is important that we should strike a balance between the following interests: on the one hand, there are the interests of consumers in healthy food without residues, in other words in safe plant protection products that do not endanger public health and the environment, and in clean drinking water; on the other hand, consumers also have an interest in a reliable supply of fresh and affordable products, and they want home-grown fruit and vegetables rather than those from countries outside the EU, given that there are scarcely any checks on the pesticides that have been used those countries. Our farmers need certain plant protection products if they are to combat resistance. That cannot be done, however, without a certain number of protection products. At the same time they want safe, risk-free protection products. This is why we also believe that demonstrably carcinogenic substances must be banned. As regards the other licensing criteria, however, we intend to rely on scientific evidence and base our approach on maximum values. That is a balanced midway position that protects our consumers while guaranteeing that home-grown fruit and vegetables are affordable as well as being subject to adequate testing. As far as informing neighbours is concerned, if we have stringent licensing criteria and if we test plant protection products properly, I cannot see why we have to go through bureaucratic procedures to alert neighbours and local residents to the use of plant protection products when they have not even asked for information. What are consumers supposed to make of such information? How, in practice, are farmers supposed to inform all their neighbours and all residents of the local area before they apply plant protection products? It is for these reasons that I argue passionately against the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which would impose this very requirement, and I also advocate rejection of the Commission’s proposed public information clause at this point, for if we have safe plant protection products we have no need for these bureaucratic procedures. Let me make a very brief comment on the zonal approach. We are seeking greater harmonisation. That is the main point for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection too. The provisions proposed in the Breyer report would result in 27 national licensing zones. Our aim, after all, is harmonisation with due regard to the opinions of the Member States, which could adapt this authorisation to their own conditions of use. I therefore urge the House to support this harmonisation effort and to back the Commission’s zoning proposal.

Mr President, in March 2007 the European Council, headed by our Chancellor Angela Merkel, decided that 20% of total energy consumption should come from renewables by the year 2020. The advantages are self-evident: lower CO2 
emissions, less dependence on energy imports from unstable states, growth and employment opportunities, especially in rural areas. Following the summit decision, we now have to implement those objectives. The following points are particularly important here. The Commission must have the necessary powers and resources to be able to ensure that the individual Member States actually comply with the objectives set at the summit. If we want to achieve a target of 20% of total energy consumption being made up of renewables, then every Member State must play its part. At the same time, as provided in paragraph 9 of the report, each Member State must be free to choose the most appropriate renewable energy source in the various sectors. Another key issue is improving energy efficiency. We can only achieve the 20% renewables target if we improve energy efficiency as a whole. There is an enormous untapped potential in the area of building insulation and energy-saving electrical appliances, where there are many innovative technologies that could already be marketed. We must also do more than before to introduce renewables in the heating and cooling sector, given that 40% of total energy used in the EU is used in buildings. There is a huge potential here for the use of renewables. Modern structural planning and energy-saving new buildings can help ensure that renewables cover the entire energy demand for buildings. Biomass is another source of renewable energy, which must be further developed because of its versatility and base load capacity. We must ensure, however, that biomass production is sustainable and does not compete with food production. Here, as stated in paragraph 57 of the report, we must ensure that biomass is managed according to internationally recognised high standards of sustainability. It must also be ensured that overall the development of biomass has a positive effect on the climate and energy. It is also important to note the contribution of nuclear energy to climate protection. At present, we cannot do without nuclear energy as a low-emission technology. A high priority must also be given to research into renewable energy sources in the EU. Technological developments in this area are decisive to sustainable energy supplies. In particular, we must further encourage and promote the development of storing renewable energy sources, for example on the basis of hydrogen technology. All in all, I eagerly await the Commission’s proposals at the end of this year. I hope the Commission will take many of Parliament’s requests on board.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that workers’ mobility needs to be promoted. However, in many Member States, such as Luxembourg, Austria and Germany, this directive will have a huge impact on all occupational pension systems. Only 1.5% of workers move to an employer in another Member State, but the other 98.5% of workers who remain in their Member State will also be affected by the directive. I should like to say this to Mrs Jöns: it is these workers who we will be damaging if occupational pensions, which are of course voluntary, are no longer offered by companies because they are no longer affordable. Entire national systems could collapse. Occupational pensions are of huge importance in the light of our ageing population. However, companies are under no obligation to offer occupational pensions. Applying the directive to defined-benefit pensions – as is currently envisaged – would penalise those companies that have given extensive pension guarantees in the past. We are running the risk here of companies withdrawing their voluntary occupational pensions. In addition, according to the current proposal of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, people are to acquire pension rights immediately on reaching their 25th birthday, without there being any vesting period. This would mean an enormous increase in both bureaucracy and costs, making the whole scheme unaffordable. Adjusting the pension rights of inactive scheme members to the value of the rights of active workers – indexation – would increase costs by 30%. This was the main reason why the Dutch Minister for Social Affairs and Employment voted against the directive. We need reliable, predictable and affordable rules. We are in favour of mobility, but on such conditions that the occupational pensions systems, which are so important for workers, are not put at risk. Should the relevant amendments not be adopted, in the interests of workers I will be voting against the report.

 Madam President, I too should like firstly to thank the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, for his excellent and very professional work on this dossier. I can fully support the compromise that has been negotiated with the Presidency. I should therefore like to comment briefly on just one point, which we have already considered in the debate on Euro 5, and which is particularly important to me, namely access to vehicle repair information for independent garages. This access to information is of crucial importance for European citizens. Anyone who is on holiday, travelling in Europe in his car, can break down abroad. Often, however, the nearest authorised repair garage is hundreds of miles away. That is why we need to ensure that free, independent garages are also able to repair that motor vehicle. Furthermore, all drivers in their home countries should also be able to choose the garage where they would like their vehicle to be repaired. This competition will definitely also benefit consumers. We will guarantee this with our new rules. To this end we have included an explicit provision in the new type-approval framework directive stating that vehicle manufacturers have to make all of the necessary information readily available to independent garages to ensure that they are able to repair and maintain a motor vehicle. This provision is consistent with the wording of the Euro 5 Regulation, which we adopted last year at its first reading. Our objective is to guarantee access to repair information for independent garages. This should be ensured for a transitional period by Euro 5, but should ultimately be provided for in the type-approval framework directive. Finally, I should like to appeal once more to Commissioner Verheugen to ensure that the political will of Parliament and the Council is respected in the negotiations on technical implementation, because the provisions on access to repair information also have to work in practice.
 Anja Weisgerber,

 Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur, Richard Seeber, for the cooperative spirit in which our discussions took place. He has negotiated a robust compromise with the Council Presidency, a compromise that makes significant improvements to the proposal from the Commission. It is important to adopt a European approach to the prevention of flood damage. Rivers and floods are no respecters of national borders. The measures taken by the government of a country on the upper reaches of a river have specific effects on territories further downstream. In many cases these territories belong to another country. For this reason I consider it important that each and every Member State of the European Union should take preventive anti-flood measures rather than waiting until a disaster occurs. As with other proposals from the Commission, it is our parliamentary duty to ensure that unnecessary red tape, excessive administrative input and pervasive reporting obligations are avoided. We managed to prevent and considerably improve a number of excessively bureaucratic provisions. I particularly approve of the compromise safeguarding flood plans and maps that already exist or are being prepared. Thanks to our intervention, all maps and plans already compiled by the Member States are now recognised along with those that are in the course of preparation, provided they are completed by the end of 2010. The process of drawing and producing these flood maps is in full swing in some countries. Moving the goalposts at this stage would have caused unnecessary duplication of effort, and the new tendering procedure would have generated a great deal of additional expense without any recognisable benefit in terms of better flood prevention. For this reason I am pleased that the compromise provides for the possibility of recognising these maps and plans in the framework of the Directive. I shall therefore vote for the compromise, and may I once again thank the rapporteur for our constructive cooperation.

. – (DE)
 Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their solid cooperation. The Euro 5 Regulation will ensure two things in the future: firstly, that independent repair shops have unimpeded access to the repair information they need, and, secondly, ambitious emission limit values for modern passenger cars which will lead to better air quality. Effective health protection and promoting small and medium-sized enterprises – these are goals which I wholeheartedly support. For this reason I will be voting for the compromise which we have negotiated with the Council. On the first point, access to repair information, the following should be noted: modern passenger cars are equipped with a plethora of electronically steered car components. These cannot be repaired without particular information from the car manufacturer. Independent repair shops therefore require access to this information. This is also important for consumers. In future they can decide which repair shop to take a car to for repairs or for servicing. This promotes competition and so it also leads to lower prices. In my view, however, our ultimate goal should be to integrate the regulation of access to repair information into the new type verifying framework directive. Legally and thematically, that would be a better place for the rules than a Regulation on emission limit values. In this respect I am pleased to say that the Council has adopted our idea that we have developed in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Just a brief remark about the second point, the new emission limit values. The new limit values make soot particle filters almost mandatory. This is an important step towards better air quality. It is also right that the new Euro 6 limit values should be laid down even now, for that gives car manufacturers the security to plan ahead and to invest, thereby promoting innovation. Tomorrow we will adopt a Euro 5 Regulation which stands for improved health protection and which at the same time strengthens small and medium-sized enterprises.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my very warm gratitude to the rapporteur for his constructive cooperation. We have achieved a great success; the directive on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles can be adopted tomorrow at first reading, and we have indeed already reached agreement with the Council. This directive draws together the 25 different sets of legislation governing explosives within the European Union. This means that we have done away with another little bit of bureaucracy. Through this directive, we will be a large step closer to realising the internal market for the trade in fireworks, airbags and other pyrotechnic products. There will no longer be a need for special products to be manufactured for each Member State, which will give rise to enormous cost savings. The industry can now focus on meeting uniform requirements across Europe. I have been calling, in particular, for a simplified procedure for those who use fireworks professionally. The aim of this simplified procedure is for the manufacturers or importers of fireworks for professional use to implement their own quality assurance systems. The manufacturers or importers will, however, continue to be subject to regular monitoring by competent authorities. In this way, we have given more responsibility in this area back to the businesses, thereby avoiding excessive bureaucracy. We were able to introduce specific regulations for the field of automotive engineering, which includes airbags and seatbelt pretensioners. This area, in particular, requires high safety standards without overlaying these with requirements for the labelling of airbags that are built into vehicles anyway. It is, in particular, the consumers, and I would like to emphasise this point, who will benefit from the new directive, as it affords them improved levels of safety. There have been a handful of very serious accidents with fireworks due to the differing safety requirements of the Member States. A procedure is now being introduced according to which safety requirements will be just as high in every Member State. Tomorrow, through the vote on the fireworks directive, we will realise the internal market in this area, whilst at the same time providing greater safety levels for consumers.

 Mr President, the constructive negotiations with the rapporteurs have brought about a sustainable compromise. If we are to achieve our main goal, that of effective and lasting improvement in air quality, it is vital that we establish limit values, but they, on their own, cannot improve the quality of the air; that can be done only through effective action to deal with emissions, such as the Euro 5 emissions standard that has already been proposed and which makes soot particle filters mandatory for new vehicles. It is primarily from the Commission that we demand further measures, in the shape, for example, of rules on residential combustion sources, Euro 6 for HGVs and Europe-wide limit values for ships’ engines. Generally speaking, we want to get away from actions that grab headlines but are no more than short-term and temporary, in favour of long-term measures that, by addressing the problem at its source, protect health more effectively. That is why our annual limit values, at 33 milligrams per square metre, are more ambitious than the Commission’s, and why we want more flexibility at the local level when it comes to daily limit values, which have been demonstrated to be largely subject to meteorological influences, since it is a proven fact that it is long-term exposure that is the most dangerous, and that is what we have to focus on. By reducing the annual limit values for particulates we seek to create incentives for long-term and sustainable projects such as environmental zones or the introduction of soot filters. More rigorous annual limit values and the effective reduction of long-term pollution brings people more benefits than closing a road for twenty-four hours. At national and local level, too, everything proportionate and necessary must be done to improve air quality, and we are creating the right incentives for that as well. Local authorities will have their deadlines extended to a maximum of six years only if they can produce action programmes that show that they have, within the bounds of proportionality, taken every step in their power to improve air quality; moreover, this concession will not be granted to all of them, but only to those that demonstrably have to contend with particularly unfavourable meteorological conditions brought on, among other things, by being located in basins. These clear messages are precisely what this compromise is about, and it thereby constitutes an even-handed and effective way of giving public health the protection it needs.

 Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for drawing up this report. Having, on behalf of my group, helped to produce the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I, too, have had to give this dossier my attention, and I would like now to concentrate on two principal points. Firstly, I would like to say how much I welcome the Commission’s proposal for the abolition of vehicle registration tax. It is this that leads me to endorse the report, subject to the condition that the progressive abolition of vehicle registration tax is retained. Among those Member States that levy a registration tax, there are massive differences not only as regards the amount of the tax but also the basis on which it is calculated. Of all the charges levied on private motor vehicles in Europe, it is in registration tax that the widest variations are to be found, and, as these differences interfere with the smooth functioning of the internal market, the proposal for the abolition of registration tax should be acted on. Along with my colleagues, in particular Mr Langen, I also endorse a direct proportional link between the tax burden and the amount of CO2 emitted. Every gram of CO2 discharged into the atmosphere has the same effect on climate and should therefore be subject to the same amount of tax. In doing this, the tax must also be technology-neutral; proportionate taxation guarantees that vehicles producing higher levels of CO2 will be taxed more than those that produce less, and that is crucial in terms of climate protection. I also believe that pollutants such as NOx and particulates should be included in the tax base for motor vehicle taxes in order to encourage environmentally-friendly cars. With this end in mind, we in the Committee on the Environment have already managed to get these amendments accepted, and tomorrow in the plenary I will be voting in favour of the report as a whole and of Amendments 10 and 19 in particular.
 Anja Weisgerber,

 Mr President, may I too express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Seeber, for his work. There can be no doubt that we must do something to prevent these flood disasters. In my opinion, however, we could also achieve adequate flood protection in Europe without a directive on the assessment and management of floods. That is my firm conviction. The Commission, as we all know, originally announced a communication, not a directive. We as politicians have a duty, now more than ever, to avoid unnecessary red tape in the form of European directives. For this reason I actually believe that we can achieve the same ends by other means, such as enhanced cooperation. One thing must, in any case, be clear: if we have to adopt a directive, it must take account of the Member States’ previous efforts. This is the protection of previous work to which the rapporteur also referred. If the aim of a new directive is already being pursued by Member States with the aid of appropriate measures, we in the European institutions should respect that. It is therefore absolutely imperative that consideration be given to efforts which Member States are already making. If Member States have already compiled flood maps for particular areas or in cases where a risk assessment has already been carried out, such work should not be devalued by directives, and there must be no obligation on these states to compile new maps or carry out new risk assessments. That would create too much bureaucracy, which is something we must and will combat. For this reason, may I ask the House to support Amendment 71 in tomorrow’s plenary vote. This amendment, which was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, provides, among other things, for the Member States to opt against compiling flood-risk management plans if they already possess plans with which the aims of the directive can be effectively pursued. That is subsidiarity; that is flexibility. I would have liked to see more of that kind of flexibility, however. Local stakeholders should be able to decide, for example, which scale is most suitable for the mapping of each part of the river for the purposes of preventive flood management. That is one of the reasons why I am actually opposed in principle to a directive.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal for a directive to protect workers against optical radiation was, as regards what it had to say about protection from sunlight, a masterpiece of European over-regulation. At second reading, and by an absolute majority, we in this House nailed our colours to the mast by voting to remove the provisions on protection from natural radiation. In the conciliation process, too, we showed that we MEPs are able to get our own way, rather than being powerless and at the mercy of the Commission’s mania for lawmaking. We are empowered to draft the sort of directives that will be of benefit to the public. Verheugen and others are always talking about the better lawmaking that will bring about more growth and jobs in the EU, but it is regulations like these that need to be improved first. It is a matter of considerable surprise that we have now been able, in the conciliation procedure, to persuade the Commission and Council of this. The parts of this directive that make sense – the ones dealing with the protection of workers from artificial optical radiation, such as lasers, infra-red light and the like – remain unchanged. As regards the regulations on natural radiation, it has to be said that the Commission missed the mark by a long way, for the original proposal for a directive required employers to commission comprehensive assessments of the risks associated with sunlight and bureaucratic action plans to deal with them, which would have involved employers having to provide t-shirts and suncream for workers working outdoors. It would also have entailed liabilities of which employers would have been unaware, and, in any case, any sane person is the best judge of when and how they should protect themselves against the sun. It is all about personal responsibility and is pretty much the last thing that Europe should be laying down the law about. Europe has quite different problems to deal with, in the shape of unemployment, exhausted social security systems and more and more aged people among the population. Those are the things we need to worry about, not protection from sunlight. Even the Commission and the Council have come to their senses and recognised this in the course of the conciliation procedure, and I am very glad that they have. It has made possible a considerable improvement in the directive and prevented over-regulation that would have resulted in needless additional expense, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. I urge you to vote, tomorrow, in favour of the Conciliation Committee’s proposal, and then we will flag up our desire for less bureaucracy and less red tape throughout Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I voted today in favour of Mr Fruteau’s reports on reform of the sugar market, I did so quite deliberately, for the sugar market in the EU is a very sensitive one. Sugar beet is an important product for many of our farmers, being one that can be cultivated in places where the conditions are too adverse for other agricultural produce, and so well-considered reform is vital if the survival of farms – the small and medium-sized ones in particular – is to be ensured. Reform is needed, but the Commission’s ideas about it again far overshoot the goal, and so we are today calling for even smaller cuts in the price of sugar and beet, more support for the cultivation of sustainable raw materials as a substitute for the cultivation of beet and higher compensation payments. The Council, too, has seen the need for adjustments and has, in its decision, referred to many of our demands. The Council decision in itself amounts to a triumph for this House and for Europe’s sugar-beet farmers, but the cuts still go too far. In the light of these events, I think it sends completely the wrong signal that the Council should, at the Commission’s insistence, formulate a statement of intent even before Parliament has voted. I believe that the amendments we have proposed today represent an even better way. What we have here is a good reform; I want a better one. It is for that that I stand, and for that that I, today, have voted.

 Mr President, I would like to start by extending warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for the work he has done. Important though the protection of the environment is – as one who concerns myself with environmental policy, I have set it as my declared objective – we must find a way of balancing the environment against legitimate business interests. My particular concern today is with the ban on nickel-cadmium batteries in power tools. To ban them outright, whether now or after a transitional period of four years – which is what the rapporteur proposes – would be going too far. As a substitute for that, I prefer to back the Common Position and Mr Krahmer’s Amendment 45, which make provision for a review of the derogation from the ban for nickel-cadmium batteries in power tools after four and seven and a half years respectively. It would then be considered whether equivalent alternatives existed and whether a ban on nickel-cadmium batteries was reasonable and justified – which, as things stand at the moment, it is not. While there are already, in many areas, technological alternatives to nickel-cadmium on the market, nickel-metal hybrids being one example, these alternatives cannot as yet be regarded as equivalent to nickel-cadmium, as demonstrated, inter alia
, by various differences, for example the fact that the lifetime of nickel-cadmium batteries is longer than that of their nickel-metal hybrid counterparts, and they are less susceptible to faults and defects. Nickel-cadmium batteries can be charged up more quickly and discharge themselves much more slowly when out of use. It is also worthy of note that nickel-metal hybrid batteries do not function when the temperature falls below 10° Celsius. It is the desire for a consolidated market position that motivates manufacturers to develop more and more new technologies, but a ban at the present time or in four years’ time would be counterproductive, for they would have to change over their production methods to handle a type of technology that is not yet fully developed, while the research and development sector would not be able to come up with financial resources that this would demand. A ban would therefore do nothing to foster innovation in the field of new technologies nor, consequently, anything to benefit the environment either, and we surely cannot want that. I will close by expressing my support for Articles 95 and 175 as a dual legal basis.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by adding my own thanks to Mr Őry, the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job of work. Which way do we want Europe to go? We are experiencing a constitutional crisis. We are going through a financial crisis. People no longer understand Europe. We have to make every effort to get the public back on board. The proposed rules on natural radiation in the Common Position will do the precise opposite, being a classic example of excessive regulation and the bureaucratic approach. They bear no relation to the European Union’s efforts at deregulation. The Commission and the Council are always talking about better lawmaking as a means towards more growth and job creation in the EU. My concept of ‘better regulation’, though, is a rather different one; it is that it is with regulations such as these that we must make a start. With their requirements for protection against the sun, the Council and the Commission are shooting well wide of the mark. The mere fact that a variety of climate conditions prevail in the EU means that there are also many practical considerations militating against a Europe-wide regulation of this kind. I do not believe that protecting workers from the sun should be treated with the same importance in Finland as in Spain or Greece. We are taking responsibility away from the people of Europe; whatever happened to workers’ personal responsibility? How, moreover, can it be determined whether sunburn was sustained during leisure or at work? What about the problem of liability if employers carry out the comprehensive risk assessments in relation to the sun’s rays, which this directive will finally impose? Let me give you another brief example. I had a discussion with a workplace safety and protection officer, who told me how he had stood beside a worker, next to whom was a metre-high jet of flame. He asked the worker why he did not put the flame out, to which the reply was: ‘you are the one who is responsible for safety in the workplace’. That is an example of why we need to give workers a sense of being responsible for themselves. Tomorrow, we in this House will be able to indicate our desire for the dismantlement of bureaucracy and for deregulation, and to send a message to the effect that we have learned something from the referenda in France and the Netherlands. Like Mr Mann, Mr Bushill-Matthews, and many other MEPs, I have tabled amendments aimed at removing the sun from the scope of the directive. I ask you to support our amendments or at least the compromise adopted in the Committee. We must regain the trust of the people of Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to revive the Lisbon process, the Barroso Commission has publicly committed itself to cutting through red tape and to deregulation, and this House must support it in this endeavour. Tomorrow, we will be able to take a step in the right direction by voting in favour of a flexible, modern and forward-looking revision of the Working Time Directive. A European directive must, by definition, allow the Member States the creative space and flexibility to apply it in their own way, and so our main objective, at European level, must be only to set out the guiding principles. If what the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has proposed is accepted, that is, if the whole of the time spent on call is, in principle, to be treated as working time, and if the opt-out is to be abolished, then this will represent a considerable hindrance to flexible working arrangements throughout Europe. This is not what I would regard as a modern solution. It cannot be fair that we should set down as applicable to the workers concerned the principle that time spent on call is seen in its entirety as working time, for there is no likelihood of, for example, fire-fighters, youth workers and staff in rehabilitation centres over-exerting themselves, as being on call in these involves being inactive for most of the time. It is for that reason that we advocate the drawing of distinctions between different types of on-call service. Let the hospitals, the doctors, the fire services and the youth workers, together with the local social partners, decide among themselves what working arrangements are right for them. Let us vote to give workers freedom of choice. Let us opt for flexibility, which requires the opt-out, longer reference periods and reasonable and appropriate differentiation between different types of standby duty. It is for these that we are aiming with our Amendments 26, 27 and 32, along with Amendments 29 and 30 on on-call services, and these I ask you to support.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by thanking Mr Maštálka for drafting this report. Health and safety at work are key objectives of European policy, and so I welcome the Commission communication and Parliament’s own-initiative report, both of which reflect the principle that the practical enforcement of standards of safety at work be subject to controls and that deficiencies in national implementation be reported. Almost all the Member States have had infringement proceedings brought against them on the grounds of their failure to properly transpose the EU’s rules and regulations on health and safety at work. It is for that very reason that we must have as our main and initial objective compliance with, and monitoring of, the existing regulations even before the EU enacts new regulations and directives and imposes requirements. This is where adherence to the subsidiarity principle is a matter of priority. As the Commissioner mentioned, responsibility for the enforcement of the health and safety at work regulations lies principally with the Member States, the regulatory bodies and the local social partners. These must be reinforced, as is indeed demanded by paragraph 12 of the report’s motion for a resolution. If uniform conditions for competition are to be created, support for the new Member States is particularly important, for they have enormous potential for development. Nor is it tolerable that small and medium-sized enterprises should bear the brunt of this legislation. They create most of our new jobs and are our driving force as we journey towards Lisbon. I have called in my Amendment 3 for the rationalisation of health and safety at work regulations, which will make them more efficient without thereby reducing the standard of protection that workers enjoy. We also need preventive strategies that can be communicated to people. My Amendment 2 therefore calls for priority to be given to informing workers about preventive measures. What is most important to me is that Articles 27 and 29, which articulate generalised concerns about the proposed working time and services directives, should be deleted. They are too sweeping by far, and have nothing whatever to do with the title of the report. It is not for us to comment on other lawmaking processes or to attempt to use a non-legislative report to make legislation through the back door. I have, in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, tabled a number of amendments that improve the report, changing it in such a way that it achieves its actual objective, which is the uniform implementation and monitoring of existing provisions in all the Member States, whilst avoiding the creation of new bureaucracy. I therefore ask for your support.

 Mr President, I am very grateful to this House for rejecting the scandalous attack on the Pope by the Liberals. Even in the somewhat more carefully chosen words of Mr Graf Lambsdorff it would have been a scandalous statement. I have to say quite clearly that attempts are being made in this House to place the highest moral authority of the 21st century, which extends far beyond the billion Catholics and provides support for Europe and the entire world, on an equal footing with torturers, human rights abusers and dictators. These are unheard of matters in hand and will return to haunt the Liberal Group and also the German FDP Party.

 Madam President, Bavaria and its municipalities have many contacts all over the world, as does the Catholic University of Eichstätt. I should therefore like to welcome a delegation of mayors from this region. Madagascar is a country with which we work closely and intensively. There are many cultural, economic and scientific contacts and a strong and supportive ecclesiastical presence. That is why it is all the more regrettable that, in this scenically beautiful and culturally rich country, such appalling abuses are being committed. There is a real danger that Madagascar, in its strategically important location, will become a failed state, like others we know of in Africa, first and foremost of which is Somalia. It is therefore important that orderly and democratic relations are restored there as quickly as possible. That is why I am pleased that we met the contact group a few days ago to discuss first concrete steps. We must create an appropriate structure to prepare for new elections under the leadership of the ousted democratically elected president, whom we continue to recognise as the only legitimate head of state. A dialogue must be opened, which must include the prime minister, who is currently in prison and who must be released immediately. Not only humanitarian aid but also vital development aid, especially medical care, must continue to be given to the fullest extent. For all these reasons, we in the European Union are called upon to be involved in the negotiations there, not only as a humanitarian factor and not only as an economic factor, but especially as a political factor bringing about peace in the region. To achieve this, we count on the cooperation of the African Union, which once again has the opportunity to establish itself little by little as a factor in democratic stabilisation – stabilisation can in fact also be anti-democratic – which we will intensively support with the means at our disposal.

 Madam President, 20 years ago socialism collapsed at the pan-European picnic on the Austro-Hungarian border. I had the honour of being allowed to take part in the relevant preparations and I will never forget, a short time later, the Chancellor of Unity, Helmut Kohl, and Pope John Paul II, two spearheads of this development, striding through the Brandenburg Gates and saying that socialism should not be replaced by predatory capitalism but by freedom and a social market economy. Today, we are witnessing in Latin America a dangerous regression into socialist dictatorship and oppression. The germ from which this comes is, I am afraid to say, Venezuela. President Chávez is attempting to stifle freedom throughout Latin America by means of oil money. That is why the case of Manuel Rosales is so important. Mr Rosales is not only an outstanding democrat, whom we must defend; he is also a symbolic figure for democracy in Latin America. We shall support him and continue to stand up for the freedom of the Latin American people.

 Many thanks for that very good and very exhaustive reply.

Second, will you name a date for Macedonia this year? Third, what is the timeframe for relaxing visa restrictions?

Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your very good and detailed answer and also for your excellent work on these two important projects which cross in Munich. I have just two brief supplementary questions: Firstly, there is a rumour regarding the Brenner Base Tunnel, that it might be reduced to passenger transport. Can you rule this out? Secondly, in Austria and in Stuttgart a great deal is being done for the main route from Strasbourg to Vienna and Budapest. However, we have the problem of the Munich bypass, the Munich airport link and the stretch from Munich to Mühldorf, Freilassing and Salzburg, so the Chemical Triangle and the stretch via Mühldorf. I would like to draw your attention to this in particular, as progress here is still very slow.

 Mr President, 30 years ago during the autumn of 1979, this House adopted the first urgent resolution in relation to Afghanistan, the author of which was Otto von Habsburg, whom I worked with at that time. It related to a warning of the impending Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which then actually occurred a few months later. Since that time, this country has had a terrible history of suffering, and we ought to ask ourselves the question: what is Afghanistan? Firstly, it is in many respects a very ancient tribal society, which we cannot catapult into the 21st century in one fell swoop. Secondly, it is a country that attaches a great deal of importance to its independence, which it protected against British and Russian imperialism with a huge amount of effort. Thirdly, it is a country that suffered a lot during the 20th century and, as a result of a rather questionable intervention – this I say quite openly – by Western powers, is currently in a situation in which it has a president who many people there do not feel to be their own. This is a very difficult mixed situation. In order to ensure that there is no misunderstanding, Mr Cappato knows that I am not one of the so-called ‘realist politicians’, I am, as far as human rights are concerned, not open to compromise. We must uncompromisingly oppose this law and the oppression of women. However, we must proceed in such a way as to succeed and so as not to create the impression that this is a form of external control. We must therefore find partners in this multi-ethnic society in Afghanistan and gradually build a modern society there. This means that we must support a political concept for Afghanistan rather than a purely military solution, as has been the case thus far. Therefore, the law needs to be revised. On this, we are totally unwilling to compromise, as we are paying out a great deal for this country in which we have a military presence. However, we must do this in a way that involves the Afghans and that respects their dignity, and as a top priority this of course includes – whether some people like it or not – the dignity of women.

 Mr President, I voted against Mr Trakatellis’s report as a result of the scandalous Amendment 15, which confuses the curing of diseases with the murder of unborn human beings and reeks of eugenics. We need to be clear on this: human beings have a right to life from the moment the egg and the sperm fuse until their natural death, and this amendment fundamentally brings that right to life into question. An unborn human being would no longer have a right to life, simply because he or she has a disease. That is the precise opposite of medicine – it is murder. For that reason, Mr Trakatellis’s report is unacceptable and this amendment is a scandal that discredits this Parliament, which has otherwise time and again served bioethics and the protection of unborn human life well.

Madam President, thirty years ago I was here in Strasbourg when the directly elected European Parliament met for the first time. The Oldest Member was Louise Weiss, after whom this wonderful building, itself a splendid piece of European culture, was named. Her speech was the intellectual foundation document of the European Parliament. She talked at that time of the type of Europeans we need, united on the basis of a common European culture. This European culture is not something new, as many people think, but it is the rediscovery of something that is much older than the nation states, Mr Heaton-Harris. Borders, at least on the continent, are mostly rather artificial. Culture is deeply rooted in regions that are often divided by artificial borders, and regional culture is of enormous importance as a link between nations. One of the greatest cultural figures was the Bohemian Forest poet Adalbert Stifter, who worked in Bavaria, Upper Austria and Bohemia and united Czech and German people. This tradition must be kept alive – the culture that is destroyed by nationalism and displacement, the culture of minorities, the regional culture, the culture of European regions that span borders and, in particular, the diversity that we will only be able to preserve together. Franz Josef Strauß, the great Bavarian European, once said that we will only be able to remain Bavarians, Basques, Germans or Britons if we become Europeans in time – Europe not being a centralising factor, but a common roof against the rain of globalisation and standardisation.

 Mr President, I am very pleased with this and would also like to thank Mr Swoboda very much because this important report has been adopted with a very large consensus. I would like to take the opportunity to urge our Slovene Members, for whom and for whose country I have the greatest sympathy, to find a way once again of continuing Slovenia’s great achievements towards European integration. This country was the first new Member State to introduce the euro and was the first to implement Schengen. Slovenia is a pioneer of European unification. I would like to see Slovenia, in its national interest, also act as a pioneer in connection with the accession of Croatia to the EU.

 Mr President, in the crucial areas – human rights, the rights of minorities, religious freedom, freedom of expression – Turkey has made next to no progress, and in the last few days has even taken steps backwards. However, irrespective of this, the Commission claims that we are nevertheless obliged to take a positive position, as this is an important strategic partner. That is true, but that is a foreign policy matter. The fact that we need strategic partnerships is not a criterion for accession. However, I have nevertheless quite clearly voted in favour of the report, because the Socialist call to focus the report on accession was rejected. This report is a great success and a breakthrough for us, because it expressly avoids setting accession as a goal and because it talks about a long-lasting, open-ended process, the outcome of which is still unclear. We would have preferred a ‘no’ to full membership, but this wording nevertheless comes close to that and is therefore a great success for those of us who are happy to say ‘yes’ to partnership with Turkey as part of our foreign policy, but say ‘no’ to accession.

 Mr President, this report sends an important signal to a country that is playing a stabilising role, has exemplary legislation on minorities, has a broad government majority in which all nationalities are represented and has taken a clear European course under the leadership of Prime Minister Gruevski. I therefore gladly voted in favour of this report, and I believe that we should emphasise two points in particular: firstly, we want the Council and the Commission to tell us this year when accession negotiations are to begin and, secondly, we will not tolerate any bilateral troublemaking, and definitely not with regard to this bizarre name issue. The country is called Macedonia, whether that suits some people or not, and we must finally start to smooth this country’s way towards Europe.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I have followed the situation in the Philippines ever since the unfortunate Marcos couple ruled that country. Since then, this great island republic has experienced a lot of ups and downs, the ups and downs of a dictatorship and of attempts to move towards freedom, of economic crises and of developments towards a market economy, which were then continually stifled in a quagmire of corruption, mismanagement and, unfortunately, constant authoritarian incursions. If we look at the map we see that this island republic is of supreme strategic importance. Like Indonesia, it controls certain maritime routes that are central and vital to our economy, but also to that of Asia. Therefore, stability in the region matters a great deal, and that is why we need to make it clear to those in power that it is only through dialogue, only through the rule of law, only by strengthening democracy, infrastructure and small and medium-sized enterprises that this country will finally find long-term stability. Otherwise, it will continually be under the threat of collapse, and separatist movements, movements in individual island groups, religious and cultural movements that oppose each other will threaten the unity of the country. This is therefore an issue that is of central importance for the European Union.

 Madam President, Commissioner, we find ourselves in a very complicated situation. What is going on in Sudan is neither so incomprehensible nor so surprising that we need to wait to see what happens. A war against the people of southern Sudan has been going on there for decades. This is a humanitarian disaster brought about by the genocidal policy of Mr al-Bashir. Millions of people have been displaced and are struggling to survive and they have been in this situation for months or years rather than for weeks. That is one side of the coin. On the other side, it is true that we are involved in a situation in which we must not jeopardise the work of the humanitarian organisations. We must take their concerns and needs seriously. Which way should we go, then? We must be guided by the facts. The facts are that Mr al-Bashir is quite deliberately exerting this pressure on the humanitarian organisations. Anyone who has seen his demonstrative performance, his mocking dance in this action against the humanitarian organisations and in his demonstrations knows that he is quite intentionally being provocative. We must not allow ourselves to be provoked. However, neither must we simply shut up, as many fellow Members would like. That would not impress the dictator either. I therefore suggest that we remove the three paragraphs 2, 5 and 6 from the resolution and adopt the remainder as proposed.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I hold you personally in high esteem, but what is happening here really is an intolerable mess, involving an unacceptable degree of waste and incompetence. For this reason, I call not only on the Commission but also on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control to look in detail at this question. I am pleased that the Czech Republic holds the Council Presidency because Bavaria and the Czech Republic have exactly the same security interests. We know that, despite all the fears relating to the opening of the borders, the security situation has been considerably and fundamentally improved since the borders were opened, as a result of excellent police cooperation. This could be a model for other parts of Europe and I would like to thank the Czech Republic for this on behalf of Bavaria. We expect that the Schengen Information System will eventually cover all areas and that it will not be restricted to individual, exemplary, bilateral arrangements.

 Mr President, in this enlargement debate, we must correct three important mistakes. Firstly, Turkey is not a European country, but forms part of Asia Minor. As the President-in-Office of the Council has rightly said, Turkey is a strategically important partner and therefore we need a strategic partnership and not accession to the EU. Secondly, the problems relating to Macedonia have nothing to do with the fact that the democratic system there is allegedly not working, Commissioner. I was present at the elections and they were exemplary. There were difficulties with a tiny minority within the minority. In fact, the problems concern the dreadful name issue, which is being misused for the purposes of blackmail by both sides. Thirdly, Croatia has been ready to join the European Union for a long time. We could have completed the negotiations this year quite easily, as the European Parliament has demanded on several occasions and will probably demand again tomorrow. The fact that we have not yet reached this point is entirely due to a blockade by Slovenia in the Council. Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner, I call on you to find a reasonable solution which will finally bring this blockade to an end. The border problem is exactly the same as when Slovenia joined. We cannot allow one country to join despite an unresolved issue and not the other. Therefore, we need to support the Slovenes and Croats in their search for a sensible solution to the border problem but, at the same time, to open all the chapters in the negotiations. The two issues have nothing to do with one another and opening the chapters in the negotiations is a requirement for achieving a positive result this year with an excellent and exemplary accession candidate. As far as the solution to the bilateral question is concerned, where we are offering our help, I would ask you, Commissioner, to work towards an objective arbitration process. On Monday, your spokeswoman said that this could take place on the basis of international law and jurisprudence. I would like to ask you whether you feel this wording to be suitable for a compromise to be reached between the two sides. I would in any case like this wording to….

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have a high personal regard for you, and that is why I regret the fact that Commissioner Rehn is not here, as I am far from satisfied with that answer. I could have printed that off from the Internet myself. I will state very plainly what I was getting at with my question. Negotiations are taking place with Serbia about a stabilisation agreement currently being drawn up. I want to draw the Commission’s attention to the danger that Serbia could block Kosovo here, as in the UN and the Council of Europe. My question was, what do we do to prevent the occurrence of something like the current block on Croatia by Slovenia.

 Mr President, I would like to support Mrs Ludford’s question. The Commissioner has rightly said that this is a criterion for Serbia.

We know that that is the case for Croatia.

Madam President, the dramatic images from Sri Lanka reveal that a brutal civil war that has spanned decades is coming to a head. As we all know, whilst it may be possible to end a war by means of weapons, it is not possible to establish lasting peace this way. In addition, there can be no effective, lasting fight against terrorism, in particular, by means of weapons, as terrorism always finds a way. Therefore, it is important to get to grips with the causes. The next step must be to reach a peace settlement based on the following fundamental elements. Firstly, a clear monopoly of power on the part of the unitary State. No State can allow ethnic groups or sections of the population to arm and engage in armed conflict. This requires, however, that this State comply with democratic rules and the rule of law and actively seek a political solution along the lines of autonomy, one that finally resolves Sri Lanka’s nationality problems, which are an old historical legacy and also a legacy of colonial times, and which need to be tackled urgently. Therefore, I wish to appeal quite clearly to the European Union and all the countries of this earth to help with the development of democracy and the rule of law, with the strengthening of autonomy and of minority rights, and of course also with the economic development of a country that has been bled dry so appallingly by the terror of this civil war. Therefore, if the guns were to fall silent at long last – unfortunately we are not at that stage yet – this would not mean the end of developments, but only the beginning of movement towards a peace based on the rule of law, freedom, human rights, minority rights and national autonomy.

Madam President, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to congratulate Mr Lagendijk on his excellent text. We support the reform programme in Serbia and we respect, of course, the tiny minority of EU Member States which have not recognised Kosovo under international law. However, we want to discourage people from believing that this development can be reversed. Three-quarters of the Members of this House voted in favour of recognising Kosovo. The Commission has also declared itself in favour, together with 23 out of 27 Member States, all the G7 countries, four of the six former Yugoslavian republics and three of Kosovo's four neighbouring countries. This demonstrates that this development is irreversible. This is why it is important to look to the future, which involves a number of risks. The first major risk is the division of Kosovo. Until now the former Yugoslavia has been divided along the borders of the old republics or along the old internal borders of the autonomous regions. If the map is to be redrawn, for example in Mitrovica, the result would be that, for example, the Albanians in the Preševo valley in Serbia, the people in Sandžak of Novi Pazar and others would begin to question where the borders should lie. This would give rise to a highly dangerous situation. For this reason, it makes sense to follow the Ahtisaari plan, which respects the old internal borders of Yugoslavia while providing mutual and extensive protection for minorities. The protection for minorities offered by the former Ahtisaari plan, which now forms part of the Kosovan constitution, is the most comprehensive programme of protection in the world. The Serbs in Kosovo should take this opportunity and make use of this minority protection. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you know that I myself come from a minority which was once abused to suit the purposes of others. The Serbs in Kosovo must ensure that they avoid this type of situation. The other danger which threatens Kosovo is that of chaos and corruption. In this case I can only say that we must make EULEX stronger, because UNMIK was not the solution, but, in fact, part of the problem.

 Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in Office of the Council, Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg, and the External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy Commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, for participating in our debate yesterday, and also my fellow Members for today’s vote, which was almost unanimous. The EU is indeed much more united than people say. If we remain so, we can achieve something in the Middle East, and so we must continue in this direction. The components are clear: ‘yes’ to the right of Israel to exist, ‘no’ to war and bloodshed, ‘no’ to Hamas’ rocket fire, ‘no’ to Hamas’ terrorism and, crucially, ‘yes’ to negotiations on the bones of contention, including the problem of the settlers, as this, alongside the unacceptable terrorism on the part of Hamas, is at the heart of the matter. The fundamental components are on the table, therefore, and so the task of the EU is to drive things forward with energy and determination instead of degenerating into a disunited talking shop, which – unfortunately – we have been in recent years in the matter of Middle East policy.

 Mr President, my office in Munich is situated on a street that is home to many Christian Armenians from Iran. They are members of one of the most ancient Christian communities in the world and are, at the same time, patriotic Persians. This shows that Iran/Persia has an ancient tradition of tolerance, not only towards different religions but also towards the many peoples comprising its large empire. It runs entirely counter to the Iranian/Persian spirit to rule as intolerantly as this mullah regime is doing. It runs counter to the best, most noble traditions of one of the most ancient countries on earth. Therefore, it is in the interests of the Iranian people and its future that we be clearer in our denunciation of these abuses. Ms Shirin Ebadi, who has denounced these abuses at great personal risk, and who won the Nobel Peace Prize as a result, continues to do so on behalf of all ethnic groups and all religious communities. We cannot tolerate such dreadful, abominable persecution of Ms Ebadi. She needs our solidarity. Therefore, I appeal to the Czech Council Presidency to apply its sound human rights policy in this matter, too.

 Mr Vondra, it is always being said that agricultural policy is there for only the 3% who farm, but there are 100% of us who eat.

I am in favour of free world trade, but we must be able to feed ourselves from our own soil, and so we need to preserve our farming structures: this cannot be left solely in the hands of the market.

Madam President, the problems with the rule of law in Russia are not random aberrations but a cancer, spreading systematically. We are in phase 2 of the Putin era, with Mr Medvedev as window-dressing, and the third phase is currently in preparation. Mr Putin began his first phase with the second Chechen war, an attack on a small country that was akin to genocide and was motivated by massive colonial interests in its raw materials. Since then, the matter has escalated; the rule of law and freedom of the press have been curtailed, human rights defenders such as Karinna Moskalenko have been pursued all the way here to the European capital of Strasbourg, and we have seen a total lack of progress and, as I said earlier, not just random aberrations but the systematic loss of the little democracy and rule of law that remain. Therefore, the European Union must show considerably more vigour. In our negotiations on an agreement, we owe this to the people – Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and many others – who have died for daring to investigate these aberrations or call a spade a spade. Anyone discussing the subject openly in Russia puts their life at risk, and each time there is talk of a mysterious, obscure context. Therefore, we who live in freedom and relative safety have a duty to ensure that some light is shed on the circumstances at long last, and that we in this House at least do what we can; that is, to speak clearly and frankly to the Russian powers that be. After all, that is the only language they understand, as Elena Bonner made clear in her moving speech yesterday. Let us follow the example set by courageous people such as Elena Bonner and Andrei Sakharov, and let us stop being hypocritical and kidding ourselves at long last. Let us tell it like it is. This would be the best service we could render the Russian people.

 Mr President, the history of the people of Israel is an endless tale of expulsions. Two thousand years ago they were driven out of their original homeland and became scattered all over the world. Over the centuries they have been persecuted and thrown out of the countries where they have found refuge. The dreadful climax of this process was the holocaust, the crime against humanity, which led to a huge number of Jewish people returning to the Holy Land, the land of their ancestors, with the result that clashes, expulsions and legal disputes have once again been taking place there. In a situation of this kind, the European Parliament can do nothing more than to support to the best of its ability the declared intention of the Israeli state and the peace-loving section of the Palestinian population, which I cannot guess the extent of, in order to come to a peaceful and consensual solution. There is no sense in picking out an individual case in an emergency and then deciding dogmatically that it will be resolved one Thursday in Strasbourg. However, there are clear reasons why we have taken part in this resolution. We wanted to become involved in this discussion process and we believe that human rights are indivisible. Of course, we are not indifferent to the fate of the al-Kurd family and we want to discuss their fate. However, we do not believe that we can do this authoritatively. Therefore, we think that point 4 is dogmatic in a way which does not do justice to the case. For this reason, our approach is to intervene on behalf of human rights, the peace process and, of course, the al-Kurd family, but we can only do this as part of a dialogue with both parties and not by unilaterally taking sides. Therefore we strongly support the decision, but would ask for a split vote on point 4, because this is an issue which must be decided on the spot. We offer our services for this purpose.

 Madam President, Doris Pack has, as always, submitted an excellent text, because she is not only an expert on Southern Europe, but also on education. I welcome the fact that education is a particular area of emphasis in relation to the stabilisation agreement. However, we must extend our approaches, firstly by focusing more closely on accelerating the visa liberalisation process and giving young people in Bosnia and Herzegovina the chance to find out more about Europe by studying and travelling here. The second decisive factor is the establishment of a European multi-faith university in Sarajevo, which is supported by all three religious communities in the country and which will act as a European centre of tolerance and mutual understanding, not on the basis of indifference, but on the basis of people's roots in each religion. With our strong support for the European university, this will not only represent major progress for people in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but may also allow Bosnia and Herzegovina to send a signal to the whole European continent.

 Mr President, the brutal murder of Julio Soto represents a provisional climax in the dramatic collapse of democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela, a country which for a while played a positive role in Latin America. However, under the current regime it is not only the case that fundamental human rights are being totally disregarded, but also that a megalomaniac dictator is attempting to export his inhuman system of terror to the entire continent and even to Europe, if you take into account his links with Belarus. For this reason, it is essential that we put a stop to his plans quickly, for the sake of his own population, but also for the sake of populations of other nations which he is attempting to buy or blackmail with his oil wealth, in order to impose his ideology on them. If he should raise the argument of national sovereignty, I can only say that there is something which is far more important than any national sovereignty and that is fundamental and universal human rights.

 Mr President, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is currently in the same situation as Europe after the Thirty Years War, when the rule of law collapsed. However, Congo is suffering to a far greater extent. Bands of uniformed men are roaming the country, some of which refer to themselves as the ‘official army’ and others the ‘private army’. In reality they are all bands of criminals who are plundering the country and murdering, raping and robbing the civilian population. Peace will not return to Congo until at least a semblance of the rule of law is re-established at a regional and national level. For this reason, our task in the European Union is firstly to provide humanitarian aid, but secondly to ensure that the country has a minimum level of national security. We are far from being able to do this and the intervention which took place in Congo, and we do need to be self-critical at this point, was obviously not as successful as we would have liked. For this reason, it is essential that we begin to plan straight away how we can bring stability back to this country at the heart of Africa with all the peaceful and, if necessary, military means at our disposal, or even using peacekeeping troops. We have not reached this point yet, but we must discuss it. When you look at Congo, and I have had several opportunities to fly over the country, you realise that Congo touches all areas of Africa in a way which is not the case with any other African country. We cannot have a stable African continent without a stable Congo and therefore we have very strong obligations in this respect.

In this connection, I should like to turn our attention in particular to religious freedom, just as this resolution, thankfully, also does. Christians in Vietnam are persecuted, and the Bishop of Augsburg, who is particularly concerned with persecuted Christians, is here today to talk with us on the subject. Moreover, Buddhists and other religious groups are also hindered and persecuted in the practice of their religion. We can make it quite clear that it is our duty to work to ensure that Vietnam becomes an equal partner, that it opens up, and that it draws nearer to us. This must not, however, be at the expense of fundamental human rights, but must be based on a fair partnership founded on fundamental human rights.

 Madam President, just very briefly: some of our colleagues may not be aware of this yet, but it was mentioned to me that yesterday, it was decided that the next part-session will be held in Brussels. I have heard that there are tremendous problems getting beds here in Brussels as the hotel rooms are booked out due to a trade fair. This part-session should simply have been postponed or transformed into a mini-part-session. That would have been the best solution. With a measure of good will, that could have been done. The second point which I would briefly like to make is directly related to this: has the safety situation actually been checked here in this building? I hear that there are major structural defects here. Has this building been checked using the same criteria as have now been applied in the Strasbourg building?

 Mr President, a fellow Member on the left of the House has just used the tragic issue of the death penalty in Iran and the dreadful crimes being committed there as a pretext to launch an assault on religion per se. He has attributed these actions to the religious nature of the regime. In my view, that is absurd. This is a perfectly ordinary totalitarian regime which simply exploits Islam for its own ends. That is the problem, and we must vigorously condemn the regime itself, not Islam or religion per se. Incidentally, the most heinous regimes in the world's history were those which invoked National or International Socialism, as China continues to do today. We should therefore be clear on one point: this House is not the place for ideological disputes, even on the issue of Iran. It is not about ideology; it is about the universality of human rights. This universality of human rights transcends ideological differences. There are no Asian human rights, and there are no Islamic human rights which give people less security and might condone the death penalty in one form or another. We are radically opposed to the death penalty, whether it is practised in the US, China, or Iran, but we do not view these countries as the same. We must be very clear about one thing: the Iranian regime is a totalitarian regime, and we would like to see it come to an end.

 Mr President, I have a lot of respect for Mr Schulz, but his statement today was unacceptable. Early this morning, President Medvedev described the democratically elected President of Georgia, President Saakashvili, as a ‘political corpse’. Even from a democratic perspective, that would be outrageous, but when you consider that Mr Medvedev represents a regime that had the predecessor to his predecessor, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, murdered, had the President of Chechnya murdered and has now had an Ingushetian civil rights activist murdered, then it almost amounts to a physical threat. This is not about whether or not we like Mr Saakashvili; it is a case of an obligation to support the elected representative of the Georgian people, who have become the victim of an imperialistic act and on whom an attempt at strangulation is being made. Therefore, I believe it is vital that, following our resolution, which I welcome, we go a step further and station European peacekeeping troops in Georgia. We do not need a mandate from the United Nations or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as Georgia is a sovereign nation and has asked us for a European presence. We must also ensure that this country can survive and continue in peace, because having Russian troops as peacekeepers, as the UN and the OSCE have organised, is giving the arsonist the role of fire chief.

 Madam President, this House has a strong tradition of human rights, of which we can be proud. This applies not least to our policies on China and Tibet. That is why I find it all the more regrettable that our resolution today does not live up to these requirements in any way. In an historic moment, it did not have the strength to raise what should have been raised in the run-up to the Olympic Games in China. Therefore let me state categorically: our President, Mr Pöttering, has represented our human rights principles unequivocally over the last few months. German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has done the same, clearly and impressively. I should therefore like to call upon this House to return to the clear statements of its policy on China and Tibet in past years and decades and regard this resolution as a moment of weakness before the summer recess.

 Madam President, I voted in favour of the Brok report, as I believe that it is an important step in the right direction. I also endorse the communication policy it calls for. However, communication also involves truth and clarity. It is time we finally stated clearly that Croatia can and should join the EU within the current decade. The countries of South-East Europe have definite prospects of joining the EU in the next decade, but truth and clarity also require an acknowledgment that pushing ahead with the accession of Turkey would undermine the EU. We should therefore be honest with our partner, Turkey, and say at last that we shall have to find other ways of cooperating. Although the Brok report does not actually put it this way, this is the logical conclusion from its contents, which are as they should be.

 Mr President, Mr Leinen, I am a veteran of these topical and urgent debates. They used to be held on Fridays, then they moved to Thursday afternoons. All the groups regularly used to try the trick of making a request like this if there was some urgent matter that did not suit them, like the topic of Kashmir in this case. That is why the Rules of Procedure were amended and the stipulation introduced that 40 Members – it may not be formulated very clearly, but that was the intention of the reform – have to be in the Chamber and contest the quorum. It was introduced because we were aware of the problem and, since then, there has never been the required number of Members present in the Chamber to request that the quorum be established, so it was always deemed to exist. I think it is important legally to consider the intention of this rule. I am sure it can be looked up in the committee and plenary Minutes. The intention of the reform was to link the question of the quorum with a number of Members present that was high enough to prevent it becoming a frequent parlour game, for that would almost have ruined these debates. It was with the purpose of saving them that we introduced this quorum of 40 back then. However, if we now make that 40 signatures, then the reform no longer makes sense.
 Bernd Posselt  (PPE-DE

 Mr President, Mr Leinen has accused me of suggesting that we ignore the Rules of Procedure. I was present when it was adopted, and you were not. The context was that, previously, 40 Members used to come into the Chamber, ask for the quorum to be established, and then leave. That is what the rule is about.

Mr President, we have often discussed the conflict in Kashmir here, and I must add that there was a time of hope, of rapprochement between Pakistan and India. It was hoped that the situation would ease. Alas, the domestic political crises in both nations have brought a renewed hardening and we, the European Parliament, are working very hard to get the situation moving again. I am very grateful to Mr Gahler, who, as Chief Observer of our Elections Observation Mission in Pakistan, has worked so hard for democracy in Pakistan and to ensure that our contacts with India serve the same goal and that we are supporting confidence-building. One might wonder why we are addressing mass graves, as this will not bring the dead back to life and may worsen the climate between the two countries. We are doing it because real peace can only be created when there is justice for the victims – and there are victims not just with Pakistani or Indian passports. There are victims on both sides, and the main victim is the Kashmiri people. That is why we must investigate these mass graves, we must determine where the many people are who have disappeared and are being mourned by their families. Only then can the confidence be established that is necessary for a truly peaceful solution that people also feel they are part of. Kashmir belongs first and foremost to the Kashmiri people themselves. We should therefore support a solution that finally gives the Kashmiris some breathing space, finally creates political freedom and provides a sensible compromise solution, for this is one of the longest-running conflicts of all. It has been raging since the Second World War, and it is scandalous that nobody has yet managed to bring the problem under control. We therefore support all efforts to carry out these investigations and help give the victims the dignity and justice they deserve.

 Mr President, like lemmings the majority of the Members of this House stumble from one Corbett reform to the next and each of these Corbett reforms means less democracy and fewer rights for the Members of this Parliament. Yet the opposite is being claimed. It is being maintained that people want to see more debates, while at the same time the debates on the own-initiative reports are being abolished and are being replaced by written statements. However, the word Parliament comes from parlare
 and not from ‘minute keeping’. That is for bureaucrats. People talk about having more time for legislative work. We could have this on Thursdays and on Fridays. The problem is that we do not use it. That is the reason why we do not have enough time for legislative work. True parliamentary reform – and here I concede to Mr Sumberg – would be something completely different. We are taking away our own rights, we are reducing the amount of speaking time, we can no longer table amendments, which means that we are giving up our own capacity to compromise. There will henceforth only be ideological arguments over rigid texts. I consider this to be a decidedly black day in the history of this Parliament, where I have worked for some 29 years: 15 years as a staff member and journalist and 14 as a Member of the House. I think that this process of Parliamentary self-castration has gone far enough. Even the Committee on Foreign Affairs has now lost much of its powers and potential. I regret this profoundly.

 Mr President, the former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who is now being paid to head the advisory committee of the Baltic Pipeline scheme, was already pushing for this project when he was head of government. He callously agreed the details of the operation with Moscow over the heads of his European neighbours and in so doing not only aroused historical fears but also raised quite justifiable ecological and economic questions to which there is no satisfactory answer. I would therefore say quite clearly that this project can only be realised if the fears and concerns of the neighbouring European countries, and EU partners, are taken seriously and if they agree to it. Taking decisions of this kind above the heads of neighbouring states is un-European and therefore in my eyes unacceptable. What is more, and the Polish and Czech Members can take my word for this, the same goes for other issues such as missile sites and the issuing of visas. All sides have to take a good look at themselves and recognise that when it comes to foreign affairs we in Europe need to maintain solidarity in these vital policy areas, for only then will we be taken seriously by our international partners. As a German Member of this Parliament, I therefore voted in favour of the Libicki report and against the ill-considered construction of the Baltic pipeline.

 Mr President, the brilliant foreign-policy strategist Franz Josef Strauss, whose death exactly 20 years ago we shall be commemorating on 3 October this year, always said that if you button up your jacket wrongly you have to undo it again in order to button it up correctly. That is exactly the situation that we now have in Afghanistan, for we have been using the wrong political strategy. We have built our efforts around the minority groups of the Northern Alliance and have ignored the representative powers of the majority population, namely the Pashtuns. That is why politics and democracy are simply not working there. If we do not succeed in winning over the majority of the representative Pashtun community to the side of the West, to democracy and to commitment to our cause then we shall most dramatically fail in Afghanistan, as now seems to be a distinct possibility. I would therefore simply appeal to all those involved to adopt a fresh political approach in Afghanistan and not to drive the Pashtuns into the arms of what is left of the Taliban by lumping Pashtuns and Taliban all in together. That would be a big mistake. We need a new political strategy, one that is more discriminating. As Europeans we know all about the problems of nationality, possibly even better than others. We should be applying this experience wisely and competently in Afghanistan.

Mr President, rarely has a resolution in this House ever had such a gruesome title as ‘Routine killing of civilians’. We cannot make a routine response, ladies and gentlemen; we must bring our full weight to bear. One in eight of the population have been displaced in the past twelve months, and by the end of the year half of the civilian population could be dependent on humanitarian aid. I am grateful to Mr Dess and others for the food aid and medical aid that are being dispensed there, but now we must also target a political solution that has not been in place since 1991. The only option, in my view, is for the UN force to be deployed, but it must be supplemented by appropriate civilian structures. As far as the Transitional Federal Government is concerned, we have to ask where the transition is leading. It is either a transition to a viable autonomous structure, or else it is necessary to establish an international civilian structure, as has happened in other countries. If we do not get this right, we shall ultimately have the entire nation dependent on humanitarian aid. That cannot be the way to eradicate murders, rapes and famine.

 Mr President, I also take the view that the pipeline between Germany and Russia should only be built if the other EU Member States concerned agree. However, those Member States should not then negotiate with another major power, namely the US, on missiles or visas. Europe will only be able to stand firm vis-à-vis the US and Russia if it finally adopts a united front. Let me make one thing very clear: it is our job to tell the Russians that it is in their fundamental interests to build a good partnership with Europe. However, this means that they cannot speak on behalf of other countries that Russia happens to have occupied in the past, such as Ukraine or Georgia. These countries are sovereign states and are entitled to make their own decisions about their own destiny. Mr Medvedev said in Berlin that he wants to see an improvement in relations. That being the case, he can start on two fronts. The first is the rule of law, which means taking action in the matter of the Yukos prisoners. The second and very important area is this: Mr Medvedev, please stop blocking the largest peace mission in the history of the EU, namely the Kosovo mission!

I thank the Council for that important clarification as this matter also featured largely in Ireland. I would just like to ask a brief, clear, additional question concerning Croatia.

Madam President, I believe this is already the ninth time we have dealt with Belarus, and we shall have to keep doing so until Members representing Belarus are sitting with us here in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. We urgently need three crucial advances. Firstly, we strongly urge the Government of Belarus to release its political prisoners at long last – not only the political prisoners who have already being detained for some time, like Mr Kazulin, but also the many new ones who have recently been jailed for exercising elementary fundamental rights such as freedom to practise their profession as journalists, freedom of expression or the right to demonstrate. Secondly, we call for amendment of the Religion Act and for absolute freedom of religion. There are European Christians who are being repressed here in the heart of Europe, and we in the European Parliament cannot tolerate that. We must therefore resist this with all our might. Thirdly, there is an urgent need for us to ensure that Belarus finally opens up to us as Members of the European Parliament and European citizens, that the wall of isolation is breached with which the Belarusian regime has systematically enclosed its people, that we can be present there and discuss matters and that we can help to foster something like a Belarusian Spring, 40 years after the Prague Spring.

 Mr President, this was the last calendar vote in this legislative term and we have averted five attempts to challenge Strasbourg as the seat of Parliament, and as the sole seat of Parliament, through irrational amendments. Nonetheless, may I say that we should have a comprehensive reform, because it is after all a matter of money and CO2
 emissions. May I make the point that, if we were to concentrate on the 12 plenary weeks in the year and fully utilise all five days in these weeks once more, we could then do away with the expensive and unnecessary mini-plenaries in Brussels and replace them with constituency weeks. This would bring us closer to our citizens and give us more time for our real work. It would also be much cheaper, we would cut our CO2
 emissions, and all this could be achieved through our own decisions without an amendment of the Treaties. As long as there is no Treaty amendment, we should use the current Treaties as rationally and efficiently as possible. That is why I believe that we should adopt the approach that I have proposed.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s report although it contains many compromise phrases. I did so because, at the start, it contains a crucial sentence, namely that the opening of negotiations is the starting-point for a long-lasting and open-ended process. That is the only reason why I was able to vote in favour of the report. Let me make it quite clear that my party, the Christian Social Union, has always been, and continues to be, pro-Turkish. We campaigned and worked hard for the Customs Union which was adopted by this House by a majority of just one vote. It could be argued that, at the time, it was my vote. We have supported Turkey in NATO and on a wide range of issues. Let me also make it quite clear, however, that Turkey is not a European country, and I share Mrs Roithová’s view that a privileged partnership, a tailor-made special status, is the right solution. This is the solution which will ultimately be achieved. We should finally stop pursuing this blind alley towards supposed accession. This accession is not going to happen, so it would be more honest and better for both sides if we could get together as soon as possible and agree to pursue another route, a route towards a partnership of equals, without common institutions but with common interests and a practical and agreed programme of cooperation.

Mr President, it baffles me how the Council can simply leave without batting an eyelid. I have been a Member of this House for a long time. Question Time with the Council used to begin at 9 p.m., and the Council was with us until half past ten. Then the Council asked that Question Time be brought forward to 6 or 7 p.m., and we deferred to its wishes. That was our first mistake. Since then, Question Time has always started late, and the representatives of the Council have had to leave on the stroke of seven, regular as clockwork. It is not the fault of the Slovenian Presidency; it is a general problem that we must discuss with the Council. For half of the year, the representatives of the Council can surely stay until Thursday in this beautiful city of Strasbourg and be available to us on Wednesday evenings too.

 Commissioner, you know my position - that Croatia should have become a Member long ago, if justice prevailed. However, I am not expressing my personal point of view here, but that of this House. Parliament said that negotiations should be completed by 2009 at the latest. At its meeting in Croatia a few weeks ago, the Joint Parliamentary Committee said that all chapters should be opened under the Slovenian Presidency and closed under the French or, at the latest, the Czech Presidency. Does the Commission believe that this schedule is realistic and what is it doing to speed things up?

 Commissioner, the Commission has a responsibility: it is the guardian of the treaties. The Interim Agreement states that bilateral issues must not be allowed to become a barrier to accession.

Mr President, in the old Rhodesia there used to be a tourism poster urging people to ‘Come to Rhodesia and see the ruins of Zimbabwe’. In later years, the slogan was turned around to make a double-edged joke: ‘Come to Zimbabwe and see the ruins of Rhodesia’. Today the poster might well read: ‘Come to Zimbabwe and see the ruins of Zimbabwe’ – referring not to the famous stonework, but to ruined hopes of prosperity and democracy. I believe the European Union has a duty to use the current situation – in which, despite manipulation of various kinds, the Zimbabwean Opposition’s courage has, after all, won it a major victory – to advance democracy and the rule of law in this important African state. The people there have suffered enough. We must, however, find ways of supporting them that are not liable to be interpreted as neo-colonialism. So it is important that what we do should also have the backing of neighbouring countries and of the Zimbabwean people themselves. That is why I welcome the first positive steps on the part of the African National Congress – although it needs to do more! That is why I particularly welcome the brave example set by the dockworkers. We need to state very clearly that it is the shared task of the European Union, the African Union and the various powers of southern Africa to ensure that the opportunity now created, following the elections, is properly used. Mr Mugabe already has his place in history; each day that passes merely makes it a less impressive one.

Mr President, this imposing building here in Strasbourg is named after Louise Weiss, who fell foul of the police and the courts in the democratically enlightened France of the inter-war years because she campaigned for women’s suffrage. We cannot, of course, compare that situation to the totalitarian dictatorship in Iran, but the memory should serve to teach us Europeans a certain degree of humility. The regime in Iran is an unacceptable, totalitarian one, but Iran is a big, multifaceted country, where the forces of reform are steadily gathering strength. The initiators of this petition, for example, are among the reform movements to which we must lend our emphatic support, and which have now spread to include even members of the Khomeini family. There are already more women to be found in politics, in administration and in the academic world in Iran than in most other Islamic or Asian states. That may not tally with the clichéd view but it is a fact. We need to build on this plurality in Iran in order to bring about the ultimate downfall of the unacceptable, totalitarian regime there. That is a tremendous challenge for us as Europeans. I am therefore very grateful to my colleague, Albert Dess, for helping me on Monday to keep this important item on the agenda – because, ladies and gentlemen, we need to make Iran one of our priorities in the context of Parliament’s work to support human rights!

 Mr President, today's vote is a breakthrough for Macedonia's early accession to the European Union. This success is due to the efforts of the late President Boris Trajkovski, who was a personal and a pan-European friend and who charted this course, but it is also a major success for the current Macedonian Government under Prime Minister Gruevski and Foreign Minister Milososki, who have built friendships throughout Europe for this European country: a country which has an excellent minority policy, which is achieving excellent development, and to which we want to give massive support. Let me send out a clear message: I call on our fellow Members from Greece finally to give ground on the name issue. This House has said very clearly today that it rejects any blockade due to the name issue and that bilateral issues should not be an obstacle to accession. That is the message that we have sent out with a massive majority of the House today, and it is a hefty shot across the bows of those governments which are blocking progress here. I appeal to everyone to abandon this blockade in the interests of Europe. Macedonia is a European country, and we hope that a date can be set before the end of this year for the start of accession negotiations.

Mr President, we are talking today about the only two clearly European candidate countries we have, namely Croatia and Macedonia. We hope to be able to conclude the negotiations with Croatia by the end of this year, or by next year at the latest. We hope to be able to begin negotiations with Macedonia by the end of this year, or by next year at the latest. We want to prevent both countries becoming hostages to bilateral problems, and I appeal in particular to our Greek fellow Members to show movement on this issue, as the erroneous decision taken in Bucharest is already starting to destabilise Macedonia. As regards Croatia, the Sanader government has been actively pressing ahead with reforms and negotiations. I appeal to the Council and Commission to keep up with the pace of work. I appeal to the Commission actively to strengthen its capacities and to process the relevant documents quickly. I appeal to the Council to open all the negotiating chapters as quickly as possible. When they are closed naturally depends on the negotiations and on Croatia’s efforts. Croatia has done a massive amount of preliminary political work. It has settled and resolved the issue of fishing zones with great courage, it has endorsed arbitration with Slovenia, and it has above all sent a signal of great significance to the entire region by appointing a Serbian Deputy Prime Minister to the Sanader government, and this in the light of the situation Mr Swoboda has rightly described in Vukovar, for example. Protection of the rights of minorities that goes way beyond what most Member States guarantee in terms of minority rights is taking place there. I should therefore like to say that we should acknowledge Croatia’s political achievements and decisively support the country on its way into the European Union. We are abiding by the ambitious aim to take a decision in the current period. Should this not be possible, it will be the autumn. We would support your motion, Mr Swoboda, if it contained ‘latest’ and ‘should’, but ‘could’ is only a status report, and we shall therefore keep up the pressure on the Council and Commission. We know that this is ambitious, but Croatia deserves to see justice at long last.

 Mr President, I was a sharp and clear critic and opponent of the Iraq war and I still am. I believe, however, that we must also make up for the mistakes we committed there. We in the western world – both Europe and the USA – therefore have a duty to do our utmost to secure peace and stability, which will be difficult enough. That is why the Gomes report is an outstanding one. We really should use the opportunity to support Mrs Záborská’s initiative for the release of the kidnapped archbishop. I am sorry that as a result of a management mistake on the part of this House the resolution on the subject is not on this afternoon’s agenda. It is our duty to do our utmost to help this representative of a minority whose existence is under threat, which has lived together in peace with its Muslim neighbours for centuries, and which is threatened with genocide precisely at a time when we are responsible in Iraq. That is not acceptable and that is why we must take strong action here.

Mr President, like the majority of my Group I voted against this report, not because of the subject-matter but because this important issue keeps being exploited for ideological battles about the concepts of sexual and reproductive health and rights. I want to appeal to all the Groups in this House to put an end to this ideological dispute, which is detrimental to the matter in hand. We must make it clear that reproductive health is important, but that it has nothing to do with abortion, because that does not come within the European Union’s remit and each state has the right to decide its own laws in that area. That is in line with the principle of subsidiarity, which is why the European citizens’ money may not be used for purposes that some EU Member States do not find acceptable on ethical, moral and legal grounds. We should, therefore, very definitely leave this subject out of our deliberations and concentrate on neutral concepts that actually have something to do with the question of health and nothing to do with the question of abortion, on which opinions differ in this House and where I am strongly in favour of protecting the unborn child.

Mr President, in the run-up to drafting this resolution, some of us were accused of being enemies or opponents of Russia. We are just the opposite! We are friends of Russia, we are concerned about democracy and the rule of law in this important European country. We protest vehemently against the imprisonment of opposition activists who did no more than draw attention to a fact that has been noted by all international institutions, namely that the presidential elections in Russia were extremely unfair. We call for the immediate release of the opposition activists and of others who have been held in prisons and work camps for a long time, like the so-called Yukos prisoners Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, and I support Chancellor Merkel’s call for the two men finally to be released. We must, however, be quite clear about one thing. The newly elected President of Russia has the unique opportunity to make a new beginning, to move towards democracy and the rule of law and towards a less nationalistic and aggressive foreign policy. That means, however, that he will have to extricate himself from the coils of Gazprom and free himself from the Putin system; sadly, there is not the least indication of that. That is why it is our duty to voice honest criticisms. It is not those who, like former German Chancellor Schröder, sing the praises of the Putin system and allow themselves to become involved in the propaganda and in the economic and nationalistic interests of that system, who are Russia’s friends; no, Russia’s friends support the human and civil rights of the Russian people, who have a chance of democratic development. If we remain silent, the small seeds of democracy and the rule of law that President Yeltsin sowed and that President Putin has endangered will finally be suffocated, and that cannot be in the interest of Europe or in the interest of the Russian people.

Yet we are against this resolution because it does not concern, as intended, an urgent case, but asylum law in the European Union in general and the relationship between two EU Member States, the Netherlands and the UK, in regard to that difficult question. This is not what these urgent resolutions are about. Here they are being used as a means of raising domestic policy issues.

Many thanks, Commissioner, for your reply. A little while ago you spoke at length about events in Brussels. However, events in the regions are also very important and I therefore have two short supplementary questions. Firstly, you have just been talking about bilateral programmes. Does this allow for German-Czech programmes only, or should three countries be included here? Along with Austria, this could also be Slovakia or Poland, for instance. Second supplementary question: does this also cover the Euroregions?

Mr President, this is not an item about the Russian elections themselves but about the fact that, in the immediate aftermath of the Russian elections, demonstrations were broken up by OMON security forces and 50 people were arrested, most of whom are still in custody. That was a brutal act of aggression, and we take the view that it demands an instant reaction from this Parliament.

Mr President, I would like to endorse what Mr Schulz and Mr Wurtz have said. Our purpose was not to prevent the House from addressing another issue but to put Russia on the agenda. I would appeal to the chairs of the two main political groups to let us return to the old arrangement whereby we could deal with up to five topics. The restriction to three items was a mistake, and that is the source of these difficulties.

Mr President, Mr Schulz requested that this topic be added to the agenda as an extra item. If that is not possible, I regret to say we shall have to vote against it. We would like to put the Iraqi bishop on the agenda as well as supporting Mr Schulz’s request. That, after all, is what he himself was proposing.

 Mr President, twenty years ago, I spoke at the underground universities in Czechoslovakia and Poland. It is very gratifying for me to hear, today, how much our colleagues from the Baltic countries, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland support the opposition in Belarus. I would like to express my sincere thanks to them. You are doing something important for the EU – more than the people who engage in talks which merely bolster and support a corrupt regime which needs to be abolished. I agree with Mr Buzek: Russia has a responsibility here. This is a post-colonial and pre-colonial situation and we should no longer accept it.

Mr President, anyone who has ever seen the Great Lakes region of East Africa from the air might think that it was paradise. In reality, it is often more like hell on earth. It is a region of fantastic natural beauty and a wealth of natural resources, on the one hand, and appalling suffering, on the other: natural disasters, war, expulsion, famine, disease, massacres, mass rape and ethnic conflicts – worse than almost anywhere else. There are 800 000 internally displaced persons in North Kivu alone. It is important to recognise that this problem of expulsion exists on both sides of the border. In Africa, there is a phenomenon which does not exist in this form anywhere else, namely that people are not just displaced from one specific side of the border to the other. Instead, each country expels people from its side of the border into the other country, so there are refugees and displaced persons on both sides. As a result, the countries are completely unstable. That is why we need to provide humanitarian aid, and we need a massive presence here in order to help the people. In essence, however, that is merely tinkering with the symptoms. Unless we can establish reasonably viable state and rule-of-law structures, the disaster will never end, no matter how much assistance we provide. That is why it is extremely important for us to play a major role, also politically. The cease-fire of 23 January is extremely fragile and only really exists on paper. That is why we need to force all the parties, as a matter of urgency, to get round the table and talk to each other, but it also means that we have to play our part. Regrettably, Europeans often profit from these disasters. That is why the call for us to take certificates of origin more seriously, e.g. for natural resources, is justified, for often it is the Europeans who brutally exploit the people's suffering for their own economic interests. We have a responsibility here too, and we should not be content with making pretty speeches and applying sticking plaster solutions.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, my thoughts inevitably turn back 17 years, when Slovenia declared its independence; the Minister of Foreign Affairs was Dimitrij Rupel. The majority of major countries in the UN and the EU and the majority of EU Member States refused to recognise Slovenia at that time. The Foreign Affairs Minister of one large EU Member State said that if Slovenia became independent, other countries would isolate it for 50 years. Today, Slovenia is a recognised, respected, successful country, and a good President of the Council of the European Union. Some of what has been said today in this House should be put into perspective by viewing it in the light of history. I am glad that Kosovo is now independent as, after decades of oppression, the Kosovars finally have their own free, democratic state, having been oppressed for decades and more recently finding themselves the victim of genocide that was stopped only with international assistance. I call on Serbia to realise that this is also an opportunity for the Serbian people to move forward into their European future – leaving behind the burdens of the past. It must then renounce violence, however! The Serbian Minister for Kosovo cannot then welcome the fact that UN guards on the border with Kosovo are attacked. It is not appropriate then to accuse the democratically elected leaders of Kosovo of high treason instead of commencing neighbourly dialogue with these victims of genocide. I cannot state this more clearly: it is unacceptable for Bishop Artemije of the Serbian Orthodox Church to call for war. This is not acceptable! This must be very clear – we as the European Union must help Serbia on the way to Europe, but Serbia must also play its part in creating a peaceful, good and neighbourly atmosphere. Three quarters of the Members of this Parliament were and are in favour of Kosovo’s sovereignty, so it is not possible to say that the European Union is divided, and I am happy that we are now entering into a good European future for the entire region.

 Commissioner, there is a Polish-German-Czech meeting centre in the former monastery of Haindorf in Northern Bohemia, where all the inscriptions and signs are in Latin. Could we not do the same in the European institutions buildings? Second proposal: could we not produce a Latin text for the European anthem that everybody can sing in unison, which the individual Member States can then translate into their own languages, while the common text would be in Latin?

Commissioner, did I understand you correctly that German-speaking minorities cannot receive support until 2013? Surely it is the case, for example, that real minorities exist, like the Germans in the Czech Republic, the Poles in Lithuania, the Poles in the Czech Republic etc. So if they have media or cultural projects, they cannot receive any support at all at present. Or have I misunderstood?

Madam President, I am one of the few people here in this Chamber who was present when President Sadat gave his famous speech in the European Parliament. This speech could be taken as a policy document for the Year of Intercultural Dialogue that has just begun. It was one of the greatest speeches ever made here in this House. Down through the years President Mubarak too has been an important and reliable partner for the European Union, and this is of course in spite of the many failings and mistakes that we have seen in Egypt. I therefore simply cannot understand the speech that the President of the Egyptian Parliament made in reaction to this motion. We are simply saying in a reasonable and restrained way that we consider Egypt to be one of the most important partners in the Mediterranean area, but we are criticising by way of a number of specific points and using categorical facts that some things still have to change as Egypt moves forward towards democracy and the rule of law. This is our commitment towards our own citizens and towards the people of Egypt. I certainly believe that breaking off relations, which is now being threatened, would be completely the wrong move. We need to keep talking to one another and for this reason I support this motion for a resolution, which has been drafted in reasonable language, and call on the Egyptians not to see this as a breakdown in the dialogue but as a clear signal for a more intensive dialogue to start: that is what we are trying to achieve with Egypt by way of this motion.

Many thanks for this very good response. Allow me as an exception to make a personal preliminary remark. In 1991, when Slovenia gained independence, I was at the independence celebrations in Ljubljana – as the only EU citizen, I believe. I was also in favour of the Association Agreement during the war in Ljubljana which, thankfully, was brief, and later as rapporteur for Parliament. I would simply like to say that today is a historic day for me. I am very happy. Please forgive the personal preliminary remark. Now an even shorter question: do you believe that the naming issue between Macedonia and Greece is a bilateral issue, and can a bilateral issue have an impact on accession negotiations?

Madam President, we cannot discuss the South Caucasus without thinking of our former fellow Member Ursula Schleicher, who cared about this region in a special way and to whom we are grateful for the fact that the colonialist expression ‘Transcaucasus’ has been replaced by the term ‘South Caucasus’. The region comprises three very different countries with ancient cultures, which have nevertheless suffered in the recent past under colonialism and neo-colonialism. We must therefore approach this region with great sensitivity. Armenians in Western Armenia were victims of genocide, which means that even today, Turkey thinks of the Armenia of today – that is, Eastern Armenia – in terms of an unacceptable blockade. Georgia was a colony of Russia and the Soviet Union in a particular way, which means that today separatist powers in Georgia are still being used and abused by Moscow in order to destabilise this country. Azerbaijan is in a similar situation. For all these reasons, we in the European Union must have a strong role in this region, as this was once a region where, for once, it was not us Europeans who were spearheading misguided developments, but others. We therefore have a unique opportunity to mediate, democratise and stabilise here and we must reconcile conflicting principles and interests. These naturally include stable borders, but also the peoples’ right of self-determination. We have to support the rights of minorities to the fullest extent possible, but at the same time prevent destructive separatism. We have to preserve commodity interests and geopolitical interests, but at the same time we must see that these are not colonies, but partners, with their own interests and their own dignity and deserve to have their dignity acknowledged at last. Therefore, the Polfer report does justice to this difficult challenge in a distinguished manner and I also thank the Commissioner for the enormous effort she is making on behalf of this region.

Madam President, it has been said of the last Bourbon kings that they always took action too late on an idea, a government or an army. This unfortunately seems to be the case today for the West and for Europe, because we have already allowed the catastrophe in Darfur and in eastern Chad to go on far too long. The later we intervene, the more costly it becomes, not just financially, but militarily and politically as well. I am therefore very grateful to Mr von Wogau for moving matters ahead decisively on military and security policy and I am very grateful to Mr Dess for doing the same in the humanitarian sector. We ultimately have to take action. However, the nations are procrastinating, not only on the equipment required, but also on the troops required. We need troops and forces on the ground with local knowledge and experience. I am very much of the opinion that there should be no disguised French operation, which nobody is talking about either, but we do need the local knowledge and experience of the French. We also, however, need the cooperation of the African Union and the Arab League, which are unfortunately still keeping completely aloof. This should not, however, absolve us Europeans of our responsibilities. I say very clearly: we want to get involved but we must not make the mistakes we made in Afghanistan, namely intervening without having a political strategy. Anyone who intervenes there must also know that they must have a strategy for peace talks, for interethnic discussions and for a solution to the massive tribalism and other conflicts that exist both in eastern Chad and in Darfur along the artificial borders. As the European Parliament, we should therefore be campaigning for the deployment of troops and for humanitarian aid, but we should also be making our contribution as quickly as possible to a sustainable political peace strategy for the region.

Mr President, Montenegro is not just one of the world’s most beautiful countries; it is also the Balkan country with the oldest tradition of independence in the modern era. When Belgium was founded, Montenegro had already been independent for centuries and possessed the characteristics of a state. I stress this because Montenegro is always wrongly dismissed as an example of a superfluous tiny land that suddenly found itself independent by a quirk of fate. Let me say to Mr Markov that Montenegro was annexed by its Serbian ally after the First World War. There was no question of voluntary union at that time. A pro forma 
parliamentary vote was taken, but that was all. There was a massive Montenegrin liberation movement, whose activities continued through the twenties and into the thirties. Tito then restored Montenegro’s independence within Yugoslavia, and under Tito’s Yugoslav Constitution it had a right of secession. When it tried to exercise that right, however, obstacles were placed in its way. Today it is an independent country on the way to membership of the European Union. We must support the democratic forces there. As has already been said, its treatment of minorities is an example to many others in the region, which is why the minorities supported independence. What it still needs, however, is a stronger system of independent education, such as that provided by the Franciscan school centre in Tuzi, near Podgorica. Private education initiatives are needed to release the country from its rigidity. I call on the government to keep moving vigorously along this path towards pluralism, not only in the economy but also in education and in the country’s constitutional and democratic structures.

First of all, thank you very much for your very good and thorough reply. I only have two brief supplementary questions. Firstly, is there specific cooperation with the two candidate countries in the region, namely Croatia and Macedonia? Secondly, Kosovo’s energy dependence is a particular problem. Is it not possible to provide special support for wind and hydro power in neighbouring Albania? As a matter of fact, there is considerable potential for hydro-electricity generation in Kosovo and Albania in particular but also in Macedonia.

 Madam President, if you will pardon my saying so, Mrs Flautre is talking nonsense. Muslims do a huge amount for Muslim minorities. We support Muslim and other religious minorities. However, it is unfortunately true that if we do not do anything for Christians, nobody will. The Islamic or Arab League has never championed the rights of Christians as we have the rights of Muslims. It is therefore high time that we put this matter on the agenda. It is an act of justice, whereby I must say emphatically that the problem is not Islam. Christians in the Middle East have survived 1 200 years under Islamic rule. It is in our supposedly so advanced age that they are seriously endangered, especially in Iraq, which is occupied by the West. We must acknowledge our own responsibility to make it possible for them to survive and live in freedom and dignity. Most religious persecution takes place in communist China, in pseudo-Christian nationalist Russia, in communist dictatorships – and also under Islamic regimes. For me, Islamism is simply a perverse dictatorship and ideology of the twentieth century. We Europeans have a duty in this regard, and we shall perform it. (Applause)

Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for your very comprehensive reply. I have only two brief supplementary questions. Firstly, do you think it conceivable that a date for the opening of accession negotiations will be set in the course of next year? Macedonia’s applicant status dates from more than two years ago, and it is surely high time to think about a date. My second supplementary question is this: what approach is being adopted? Are attempts being made to link Macedonia’s accession with that of other countries, such as Serbia, or is this country really being dealt with separately from any others?

 Many thanks for your good answer, Commissioner. There are two points which I would like to make. Firstly, as you know, this House voted by a 75% majority in favour of internationally monitored independence for Kosovo on the basis of the Ahtisaari plan. We voted against plans for the division of Kosovo and against any reversion to rule by Belgrade. I would like to know whether the Commission endorses this position. Secondly, like you, I was in Belgrade last week, and as you have said, the longer the decision-making process takes, the more destabilising the effect on Serbia will be. Serbia too needs a swift decision in order to be able to pursue its course towards a future in Europe.

 Commissioner, I believe that the Sanader Government and the chief negotiator, Mr Drobnjak, are doing first-class work but in my view, there are two problems. Firstly, I hear, for example, from the Slovakian side that conditions are being set for Croatia which were not set, in this form, for Slovakia. The second question is this: what is the situation with regard to the Commission's own capacities to deal with this dossier? I have heard that a great many matters are being left to lie because there is not sufficient capacity to process the Croatian dossier. Is that correct?

Mr President, we must take a very discerning view of Pakistan. It is a large and important country with a troubled history. The State of Pakistan was artificially created as a home for the Muslim inhabitants of India, and it therefore has an Islamic identity, which is something we cannot now hold against it. That was more or less its original raison d’être
. This does not mean that we should not battle against Islamic extremism, and indeed the Pakistanis themselves are devoting considerable efforts to that very struggle. Pakistan was an important ally in the face of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, in dealings with Communist China, and in the context of long-running Soviet attempts to gain influence in India. It was an important strategic factor for the West. On the other hand, it goes without saying that Pakistan has internal difficulties, of which we must be aware: a complex and heterogeneous population structure in ethnic and religious terms, widespread poverty and, of course, the need to strengthen democracy and the rule of law. We must clearly lend the country a very great deal of support in establishing free elections and a stronger independent judiciary, and must encourage the military command to hand over power gradually to elected politicians. Above all, as Charles Tannock said, we must encourage Pakistan to keep pursuing the confidence-building process with neighbouring India. In this respect there have been encouraging signs, and the purpose of a balanced policy on Pakistan is to reinforce those signs while expressing any necessary criticism.

 Mr President, every victim is of course equally important, and so I welcome this inquiry. However, Professor Hoti really was very well-known. I am in close contact with his family. He was the closest aide of Ibrahim Rugova, our Sakharov Prize Laureate, and he has been formally detained by the Serbs. In that case, they must have some knowledge of his whereabouts! This is an issue which has to be clarified formally with the government in Belgrade, with the involvement of the Council. What does the Serbian Government have to say about the whereabouts of its prisoner, for whom it has assumed responsibility, given that it is holding him in custody?

Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, so much effort, so little effect! This is how one might summarise the work to adapt the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to the needs of the economic and financial crisis. Little effect because, in view of the number of employees concerned and the depth of the crisis, the total funds allocated to this instrument – namely EUR 500 million – seems a meagre amount. However, that would be the wrong conclusion altogether. The achievements of the EGF, following restructuring in conjunction with the other solidarity and support instruments, which we have at European level, are there for all to see. The EGF is the baby here. It was first created in 2006 and was supposed to be a clear sign that globalisation does not just have positive effects on workers, but through mass redundancies, and especially through company relocations, can also have negative repercussions for workers. Thus even the more frugal budget specialists laid aside their concerns and we opened another funding pot. Now the effects of globalisation have been completely overwhelmed by the financial and economic crisis and our measured reaction is the adjustment of the funding criteria of the EGF. At the same time, one problem for our deliberations on revision was that, because of the newness of the EFG, there was no great wealth of experience in the Commission and we still find it difficult to judge the efficiency of the present rules. I would also like to note that, for the future, the coexistence of the EGF and the European Social Fund should not be overlooked. The majority of the Committee on Employment came out in favour of temporary validity for the regulation which is to be amended, so that the provisions will now apply to all applications filed by 31 December 2011 and, as regards content, will affect those workers who have lost their jobs as a direct consequence of the global financial and economic crisis. This means that from 2012 we must once again reflect on the continued validity of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. In terms of content it undoubtedly represents an alleviation, if the trigger figure for redundant workers in a given region is reduced from 1 000 to 500, and, at the same time, the payment period is raised from 12 to 24 months. This facilitates the application process and provides sustainable support for our workers until they have found a new job. The level of the EU financing share and cofinancing from national budgets was a highly controversial issue. We have found a compromise. It remains basically at 50% – so 50:50 – and only in special cases can the financing share from European funds be raised to 65%. I am very happy about this. In committee we have therefore already put a stop to further wishful thinking, as a Member State which receives funds for its workers should already be aware of its responsibilities. This is best achieved if it has a substantial financial contribution to make itself. I am especially pleased that we were able to reach a consolidation – 20% of the direct costs – in our talks with the Council and the Commission. This is exactly what we agreed in committee a few days ago for the European Social Fund. There is still enough room for future amendments and improvements. I would like to thank you for your constructive cooperation at every stage, both in committee and with the Council and Commission, and ask you to support the amendment.

Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to add to the Commissioner’s remarks on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). The EGF is also part of the European social model. He was right to say, ‘a stitch in time saves nine’. We had intensive discussions with the Commission and I would like to stress that in this case our reaction is swift, but high calibre in terms of content and quality. It is a compromise which I and my colleagues are very proud of. I would like to summarise a few thoughts from the discussion: as far as the EGF is concerned, it turns out that thankfully there is broad consensus on revision. I would like to direct a small appeal to the Commission: please do not only take residual funds out of the European Social Fund (ESF) for the EGF, but collect other residual funds from the budget. To those of us interested in social policy, it would of course be ideal if the ESF funds were spent entirely on ESF objectives and the EGF funds came from other residual funds; then we would be able to do twice as much good for workers. To my fellow Members Mrs Lynne, Mrs Sinnott and Mr Burke I will say, by way of example, that the EGF can achieve a lot, but it certainly cannot solve all regional problems. That is quite clear, and that is not its purpose. Member States still have some responsibility. I would like to make another appeal to the Commission: perhaps you can avoid exhausting the funds for technical assistance – 0.35% – which are at your disposal in accordance with the regulation. Workers would then benefit even more. The comment by Mr Naranjo Escobar was very accurate and concerns a task for the future. In view of the economic and financial crisis, we must also revise the Lisbon Strategy. I would like to direct a comment to Mr Hughes: an employment summit would surely be a fine thing, but I say to you in all honesty, a troika meeting is also appropriate if it produces something rational. We do not need to have a summit for the sake of it. We need good and swift results!
 Gabriele Stauner,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control
. – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to summarise the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the annual report of the European Investment Bank. The Committee on Budgetary Control calls on the EIB to play a more active role and to introduce a more active policy to combat fraud, involving zero tolerance for fraud, corruption, money laundering and terrorism financing. Independently of any efforts that the EIB has made in the past, which deserve our recognition, it must now pursue a policy which is not only recorded on paper, but also involves concrete measures and transparency criteria for the purposes of traceability. Therefore, companies which have been shown to be corrupt should not be allowed to take out loans and informers should receive effective protection. The investigative and preventative function of the EIB must play a more prominent role than it has done in the past. In particular, in consideration of the current financial and economic crisis, we want the same supervisory regulations to apply to the EIB as to all other commercial banks, because without real supervisory control, the EIB cannot be a credible player on the credit market. We also need independent monitoring structures which will ensure the quality of the EIB’s results and its adherence to the code of conduct. Our main concern is that Parliament should in future produce a separate report on the work of the EIB. In our opinion a report of this kind would be both possible and appropriate, because the Member States are the only shareholders of the EIB, which means that it has a direct link with, and therefore a direct budgetary responsibility to, Parliament. Thank you very much.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the principle of effective internal control is one of the most important budgetary principles that the Commission must observe when implementing the budget and utilising the funds. The European Court of Auditors (ECA) and the European Parliament have been calling for effective, efficient control of the budgetary resources for years, and numerous attempts and suggestions have been made by the ECA, in particular, seeking to ensure that the Commission uses these resources appropriately and economically. Nevertheless, the ECA has not been able to give the Commission a positive statement of assurance for years. I need only remind the House of the occurrences in connection with irregularities in the implementation of the Leonardo programme a few years ago, and other support areas that have always been very susceptible to irregularities and perhaps even to fraud. In January 2006, the Commission adopted an action plan towards an integrated internal control framework, again with the aim of obtaining a positive statement of assurance from the ECA. As stated in our report, there is no doubt that the Commission has made some serious efforts to develop the action plan. However, it is quite clear to Parliament that the implementation of the measures is a long way behind schedule. Therefore, the Commission must speed up the implementation of the envisaged measures considerably so that positive effects can be seen in the ECA’s Annual Report in the foreseeable future and also so that we Members of the European Parliament can grant a budget discharge with a clear conscience. I do not want to go into the details of the still unsatisfactory implementation of the measures, but I would emphasise that efficient control activities are now all the more necessary considering that, in connection with the economic recovery package, almost all the criteria for the implementation of support measures have been significantly relaxed, including in the interests of providing rapid assistance. I need only remind you of the planned relaxation in the Structural Funds and of the significant changes in the eligibility principles with regard to the EU Globalisation Fund. We know, of course, that all the support measures, particularly in the field of the Structural Funds, are implemented in close cooperation with the Member States, which is absolutely vital in order to guarantee the validity of the expenditure, but also generates substantial problems when it comes to control by the Commission. We have known for years that the Commission cannot always approach such controls in the Member States as it would perhaps like and as dictated by the budgetary principles and the ideas of the ECA. Parliament has great difficulties in getting a final picture, particularly in the case of the annual summaries and management declarations at national level, which the Commission presented to us for the first time on 15 February 2008, as the documents do not keep to uniform criteria. Therefore, our report – which was also adopted unanimously by the Committee on Budgetary Control – calls for continuous pressure to be exerted on the Member States to provide data that is both complete and comprehensible. It is my fervent hope that the Commission will continue to take seriously its task of introducing the internal control framework in future. Thank you very much.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on-call time is working time, as the European Court of Justice rightly ruled. Indeed, the Member States have adapted well to this state of affairs by now, and not one hospital or other institution has yet gone bankrupt as a result. Besides, on-call time, which we are discussing here, requires that workers be present at work: everything else is standby duty, which is a different matter entirely. In my opinion, the breakdown into active and inactive on-call time – possibly further defined by a more or less, but in any case arbitrarily, estimated average calculation – is absurd. After all – to put it in legal terms – workers are at the disposal of employers, are subject to their instructions and are not at liberty to divide up their own time. I oppose individual opt-outs in principle. After all, we all know that employment relationships are characterised not by equality of status, but by an opposition between invariably economically stronger employers on the one hand and workers dependent on their capacity for work on the other. Indeed, individual labour law was created precisely for the purpose of compensating for the lack of equality of arms in this relationship. If need be, workers dependent on their jobs to survive will risk their health to support themselves and their families. In times of economic difficulty, such as those we are experiencing just now – incidentally owing to serious erroneous decisions by incompetent managers – there is ever increasing pressure on workers. Yet human beings are not machines, able to work through without a break. In my opinion, the Council’s position on this is unacceptable. I largely support our committee’s report and the position of my colleague Mr Silva Peneda, and hope for a sound, humane solution in the conciliation procedure.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, approximately 2.25% of the gross domestic product of the EU, in figures approximately EUR 200 billion a year – as Mr Staes has already said – is lost in value added tax evasion, circumvention and fraud. Those are the facts on which Mr Staes’ report is rightly based. From the replies to five written questions on this topic which I put to the Council and Commission – by the way, I also regret that the Council is so sparsely represented – it has emerged, among other things, that in 2005 value added tax losses in Germany alone amounted to EUR 17 billion and in the United Kingdom to EUR 18 billion. These figures really make it clear to everyone that considerable damage is being done to the national economy and that this must be stopped as soon as possible. How is this to be accomplished, however? The answer to date was – according to the Court of Auditors, which has devoted itself to this topic in a special report – through cooperation between the national administrative authorities responsible, but that is precisely what has not worked at all in recent years. Once again Europeans find themselves in a situation where they are pursuing a well-intentioned goal but are counting their chickens before they are hatched. And in this case the chickens are the Member States which are unable to crack down on international evasion of value added tax by means of administrative measures. Thus, for example, there are major unexplained differences in the figures for requests for information received and requests for information answered. The mirror image differences in the statistics for intra-Community trade notified by the Commission in reply to my written question of 6 May, which are supposed to have amounted to the princely sum of EUR 77 billion in 2007, may also be an indication of value added tax fraud. I would take this opportunity to ask the Commission when the results of the study will be presented to us.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, preparing an initiative report on the subject of the future of social security systems and pensions is a fascinating task because this area is so topical and so complex. However, it involves the significant risk of the report becoming a long wish list and catalogue of requirements for all right-thinking people. We did not succumb to this temptation, as the relatively brief and highly technical text, which carefully avoids flowery wording, indicates at first glance. I would therefore like to thank all my fellow Members, in particular the shadow rapporteurs and Mrs Lulling, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, for their self-discipline. My aim was to produce a report which provides a description of the developments over the next 30 to 40 years for all decision makers and interested parties and which offers food for thought and recommendations for action for the individual areas of social policy. Social security and pension systems in the Member States have traditionally been designed, developed and financed in very different ways, which is why it will not be possible to harmonise them at an EU level. Nevertheless, all of the systems are in difficulty because of demographic developments and the changes to the labour market resulting from globalisation. This means that reforms are necessary in every case. Scientific findings have shown that continuing as before is not an option for any of the existing systems. That is the first important result. The type of reforms needed in each Member State obviously varies depending on the structure of each system. In our opinion, all the systems need, among other things, more and improved measures to bring about a better work-life balance, which will help to prevent the employment rate from falling, and which will ensure that social problems are not aggravated by the large-scale immigration of workers. Secondly, despite the introduction of so-called atypical employment relationships, we must retain the traditional model of full-time employment for an unlimited period, because this is the only way of guaranteeing stability for living conditions and social security systems. Thirdly, as well as ensuring that social spending is financially secure through the use of joint contributions and hybrid fund-based solutions, we must put the focus on social investment. Fourthly, we must improve productivity and increase the ability to innovate, because in Europe we are reliant on our human capital. Fifthly, we must ensure that high-quality health care is available to everyone, with medical progress and falling contributions guaranteeing basic care for all citizens. Sixthly, special measures must be introduced to protect women against the specific risks which they are exposed to, in particular poverty in old age, by crediting child care and family care time in pension insurance. A sense of solidarity across generations and social groups must lie at the heart of all our efforts in future. This is particularly true in a world characterised by change resulting from globalisation, which is becoming increasingly depersonalised and anonymous. Solidarity and subsidiarity are the basic principles of the European social model. In this context, we must ensure that globalisation has a social side, so that well-qualified and adaptable workers can support themselves and their families with dignity, receive high-quality health care if they are ill and have financial security in old age.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that women are still paid less than men for the same work is a sad chapter in our European community. Really, it is quite incomprehensible, because in law the situation is absolutely clear. Since the Community was established in 1957 – as has already been said several times – the principle has been enshrined in the Treaties of Rome as a directly applicable right. In other words, any woman could go directly to the European Court of Justice to enforce this right: the EU provides no stronger legal protection. Nevertheless, we have missed the target on this principle by an average of 20%. It is therefore absolutely vital – as the Commission is proposing here – to enforce this principle by means of secondary legislation. That being said, this situation once again shows us that there is a difference between the law and real life. People who depend on their job and their salary – many of whom are women – often simply do not dare to demand their basic rights, for fear of being thrown out. We therefore cannot simply once again call for company responsibility, based on the fact that decency dictates that women should not be treated worse than men in terms of pay. However, he that will not hear must feel. I am therefore in favour of severe and consistent sanctions for those who break the law. It is up to the Member States, in particular, finally to take this seriously and to expose those companies that contravene this principle and to punish them, for example using procurement law. I have one small criticism for the Commission: it is possible that the process has been rather too lax in this case, and that you paid too much attention to business. I congratulate Mrs Bauer on her report.

Madam President, I should like to say something about the Lambert report on the implementation of the regulation, which relates to the details of coordination of social security systems. As the rapporteur has said, the purpose of the regulation is coordination, not harmonisation, for which we in the EU do not in any case have any legal basis. However, some of the amendments adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs go beyond coordination and form the basis for new competencies and services. In our opinion, for instance, it is not necessary for the Commission to be given the power to establish its own neutral central database and manage it independently, in order to ensure prompt payments to citizens. That is the task of the Member States, which have already been performing it up to now and which, furthermore, now have to designate a liaison body for it. For citizens seeking advice too, it is also more convenient and closer to go to the authorities of the Member States and not to a remote and anonymous Commission database. I should therefore like to take issue with the Commissioner specifically on that point. Nor do we consider it appropriate for every disabled insured person to be entitled to the costs of travel and stay for an accompanying person. The payment of travel expenses for an accompanying person should be linked to the severe disability concept, which is in any case largely defined perfectly by law in the Member States. We also believe that unemployed persons who have failed to fulfil obligations in their country of employment, in particular have not taken all the required steps to find a job there, should not be able to claim benefits in their country of residence as if they had always complied with the law. That is not right. The other three amendments by my Group concern periods, for all of which we consider six months sufficient. They should not vary between 12 and 18 months.

 I abstained from voting on the introduction of the single currency in Slovakia on 1 January 2009, because I have doubts about whether Slovakia’s currency policy is free of manipulation. Furthermore, given the current uncertainty about the future of the European Union after the outcome of the Irish referendum, I think it would be appropriate to first analyse the causes and not to continue with the currency policy integration process as if nothing had happened.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my thanks for the constructive negotiations with the Council and the Commission, with the greatest debt of gratitude, of course, being owed to our rapporteur, Mr Lehideux. In committee and in the trialogue we reached a compromise for the Foundation in Turin, which is to be put on an entirely new footing by virtue of the new regulation. Our main objective in refocusing the Turin-based agency is to strengthen relations between the Foundation and the European Parliament and to improve the overall operational efficiency of the Foundation. This Parliament attaches high priority to the promotion of vocational training in Europe, and we believe that we should no longer merely assess the work of the Foundation on an ex post 
basis, as a kind of auditing body, but that we should have a specific upstream part to play in the process of determining the content and shape of its programmes and that we should be able to contribute our opinions. For this reason, we attach great importance to two points. The first of these is the composition of the Governing Board, and the second is the procedure for appointing the Director of the Foundation. On the latter point we arrived at a sound solution in committee on the basis of a PPE-DE proposal. As the rapporteur said, under Article 10 of the new regulation, the Director will be appointed from a shortlist of at least three candidates submitted by the Commission. Before being appointed, the candidates are to appear before the competent committee or committees of the European Parliament to make a statement and answer questions. A more difficult issue, and one which has not been resolved to the satisfaction of my group in the present compromise, concerns the composition of the Governing Board. The arrangement set out in the proposed Article 7, whereby Parliament can appoint three non-voting representatives, is inexpedient. We want the chance to be efficient players in the Board's decision-making processes and not mere embellishments. We therefore consider it essential that Parliament should be able to send three specialised representatives to serve on the Board, and it goes without saying that they must have the same voting rights as all the other Board members. In order to ensure that the Governing Board operates efficiently, we believe it is essential to limit the number of its members. We do not see any compelling need for every Member State of the EU to send a representative. Instead, we should make do with representatives from two thirds of the Member States, applying the rotation rules prescribed by the Treaty of Lisbon. With three representatives each from the Commission, Parliament and the partner countries, the Member States would still be preponderant. After all, a governing board is not a meeting of shareholders but is supposed to represent the body of shareholders in day-to-day decision-making and to take rapid decisions. May I therefore appeal once again to the Council – whose representative, unfortunately, is not in attendance – to reconsider its position. For the sake of operational efficiency, I ask the House to support our Amendment 10.

 – (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will keep to the report on the discharge for the other institutions and thank the rapporteur, Mr Lundgren, for his cooperation. As far as the institutions are concerned, I would like to point out first and foremost that we must at last find the legal basis for their discharge in the Financial Regulation – and this applies particularly to the Council. The current practice, that Parliament undertakes discharge of the Secretary-General of the Council and the other institutions, is not enshrined in the Financial Regulation, nor is it consistent with Article 274 of the Treaty. Particularly in sensitive areas such as budgetary control, reference to a ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ dating back to the 1970s is no longer appropriate and contradicts the principles of legal clarity and legal truth. We therefore call upon the Commission to submit a suitable proposal by September 2008, so as to rectify this shortcoming. That is why I am asking that all Members back our amendment No 1 on discharge of the Council. that these costs will be lost sight of? that administrative costs will predominate over these costs? Now I will address the costs for common external and security policy again. It is imperative, for the greatest possible transparency, that the Council resists the temptation to prioritise administrative costs at the expense of these costs in future. hit the jackpot? This year, as every year, building policies of the institutions is an area in which budgetary control has proved worthwhile. Take the Court of Auditors, for example, which did not even bother to put its own extension building out to tender or negotiate contracts for it, even though it is responsible for financing. am a bit worried that this may be meant to be 'procurement' except I would expect to see Beschaffung, so have stuck with award/vergabe I would also like to bring up again the regulations on awarding of contracts. It is unthinkable to convey to our citizens that every small municipality, when it has a contract of more than 200 000 euros to award, must call for tenders throughout all of Europe, when the institutions themselves do not observe the regulations on awarding of contracts. Allow me a last word on the Court of Auditors. I greatly regret that, according to our report, the Court of Auditors should be organised according to the European Central Bank model. I fear renationalisation of this institution, which ought to be kept free of all political influence from Member States.

I voted against the discharge of the Commission’s accounts because, in many areas, budget funds were not used frugally and efficiently in 2006. This applies particularly to money from the Structural Funds, the corruption in many areas that was exposed in 2007, and contracts for building security. I have submitted several written questions with regard to the latter, which have not been answered satisfactorily by the Commission.

Mr President, Mr Weber, ladies and gentlemen, reports from audit offices are always interesting and important. That applies especially to Europe, for the prudent and efficient use of European funds is always the subject of particularly close public attention. The report rightly focuses most sharply on the use of funds in the Member States. A great deal certainly remains to be done there with regard to the structural funds in particular. This, however, should not take our eyes off the expenditure practice of our own institutions, especially the Commission and the Council. It is in the realm of directly managed expenditure that there is most room for improvement on the part of the Commission. The Commission, in short, is not only the guardian of the treaties; it must also be a paragon of sound financial management. When I look at the shift in agricultural policy, beginning with subsidies and extending to the promotion of landscape conservation, I do wonder whether the aim here is perhaps to subsidise equestrian-sports clubs and golf clubs. Such an aim is out of tune with the real purpose of agricultural support. Buildings policy continues to give the Court of Auditors plenty to think about, whether it be the extension to the seat of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg or the Council and Parliament buildings in Brussels. The Court of Justice rightly pursues a consistent approach of exposing uncomfortable truths, particularly in cases where tendering procedures have been flawed or non-existent. It surely cannot be right that the Court of Justice has to foot the bill but is not involved in formulating the contract and putting it out to tender. Let me take this opportunity in passing to remind the Commission of its answer to my written question of 2 August on this matter. It simply creates a bad general impression if the local authority of every little municipality in the EU has to issue an EU-wide call for tenders before it can award any contract worth more than EUR 200 000, whereas the European institutions themselves can casually dispense with tendering procedures for contracts worth millions. Our citizens cannot understand that. I would also like to address the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, for each of them must also present the report we have requested. May I also ask the Council to ensure that increases in operational expenditure on the common foreign and security policy are not slipped in under the heading of administrative expenditure.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the proposals for the appointment of seven members of the Court of Auditors and can only reiterate how important the work of the Court of Auditors is in protecting the financial interests of the EU and the Member States. The Court of Auditors plays a key role in the pursuit of this aim and has established an excellent reputation. It performs its task fearlessly, fairly, professionally and independently, but of course it always has to rely on individuals, for it is people who make any institution tick. And since its members are proposed by the Member States, it is actually to the latter that my remarks are primarily addressed. On considering these nominees, some might object to their relatively high ages. For these particular positions, however, I regard personal and professional experience as crucial factors, and auditors simply do not possess these attributes in sufficient measure at the age of 25, 30 or 35. The more warranted criticism, in my view, relates to the percentage of women, which is very low. The quality of candidates, however, must also take precedence over their sex. I attach great importance to the development of team spirit and esprit de corps 
and to the quest for close ties with national audit offices. There should be cooperation, but not dependence. As you know, the question whether the Court of Auditors has too many members has been hotly debated in recent times. The decision has now been taken by virtue of the Reform Treaty. There remains some concern – and it is a legitimate concern – as to whether a Court with 27 members can still operate at maximum efficiency. The number and the profile of the members must be right. Above all, particularly in this domain, professional competence must not be subordinated to political considerations. Thinking ahead to future restructuring plans, which there will surely be, I would like to cite the example of the Federal Audit Office in the country I come from, which has a large number of members – I believe there are more than 50 – but in which each member heads a department and is fully involved in audit operations as well as enjoying full judicial independence. Whatever the future holds for the Federal Audit Office, it is and will remain our main ally in the task of budgetary scrutiny.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to some of the speakers immediately before me, I believe the Commission is only to be congratulated on the communications on which this discussion is based. They are not only a rich source for Member States seeking social facts and data but also, in my opinion, a sure sign that the EU and the Commission are serious about a stand-alone social policy. If we declare our commitment to the European social model, in the sense of not only extolling it as a tradition and historical achievement, but also of making it into a trademark for a united Europe for the future, then a stocktake of our social reality is a basic prerequisite. Particularly as a result of the enlargement rounds of 2004 and 2007, we must finally distance ourselves from the view that European social policy is an adjunct to the internal market. However, this is not entirely self-evident, for in many areas the dominance of economic policy in Commission proposals is, unfortunately, conspicuous. In this connection, I would remind the House of the Green Paper on ‘Modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century’ and the flexicurity debate. The former was shelved by the Commission yesterday, news I can only welcome wholeheartedly while recommending the same course for the flexicurity proposals, which are directed at hard-won employees’ rights in the employment relationship. All the points addressed in this report – many thanks to Mrs Lynne – are highly topical. I am thinking of the minimum-wage debate in my country and the wage claims that are supported by the current strikes on the French and German railways. When it comes to wages policy, we are right in saying that a full-time job must provide a living for the man or woman who does it. Anything else falls short of the Christian responsibility of employers for their employees. Work must be worthwhile – that must be the basic principle. What always upsets me is child poverty, which I lament even in my own country. I believe we must pay special attention to this. It should not exist. Actually, I should like to see rapid efforts in the Member States making it redundant for us to declare 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission is now willing to spend 44.2%, corresponding to EUR 57 billion of the budget, on growth and employment. The increase in the corresponding budget headings by EUR 2.3 billion for 2008 effectively support the Lisbon Strategy. I should particularly like to highlight the three pilot projects in the social sector, even though the Committee on Budgets has not approved the funds for this in one instance and has substantially reduced them in a second instance. Even the project on the employment situation in health care, which has been reduced somewhat by the Committee on Budgets, is particularly close to my heart, because there have been considerable problems here since the EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007. The pilot project should therefore be carried out as we have devised it. This applies particularly in regard to possible regulations for social services. The same also applies to another project we have proposed, namely the social integration of migrants. Please therefore support the amendments we have re-inserted. I should also like to promote once again the family project to be carried out by the foundation in Dublin, which we would like to support to the tune of EUR 400 000, but which the Committee on Budgets has entirely rejected. Family-friendly jobs, the improvement in the housing situation for families and continuing family support are also prime objectives for us in Europe. The treatment of these subjects should therefore be incorporated into the work schedule of the foundation in Dublin and the necessary funding made available, of course.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed directive raises difficult problems, as is so often the case when people are directly affected. It is about nothing less than pension rights, that is one of the sources from which income is derived in old age. Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have very detailed occupational pension insurance systems, which are of high quality and have benefited both sides, both employers and employees. The objective of a European directive has to be to strike a balance between the original motive of rewarding company loyalty and the requirement of workers’ mobility, which is of course being called for so vehemently by the business world and also by the European Commission. The method used to transfer state pension rights within the European Union – pro-rata calculation – should in my view also be used for occupational pension rights. If we want mobility we have to bear the consequences. I support my group’s amendments, but regardless of whether they are adopted or not I will be supporting the report as a whole, because it gives workers and employers security and predictability and means that they can plan ahead. However, this proposal for a directive does highlight a fundamental problem for EU legislation in the field of social affairs: unanimity is required in the Council. This case illustrates perfectly that this is barely achievable in the Council, despite the best efforts of the current Council presidency, which we should acknowledge. The significance of our Parliament’s decision will therefore barely last the day, because any decision in the Council and the content of that decision are unknown. If we are to work successfully for the citizens, we in Parliament must therefore insist on majority decision-making in this area too.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Russia is a land of culture. Its achievements in the fields of literature, music and the performing arts time and again gain our admiration and respect. In this respect, Russia is a true member of the European family of nations. However, Russia also has its shady side. The measures currently being taken by the Russian Government against human rights and fundamental freedoms are casting very dark shadows. To act against its own citizens in the manner it did on 14 and 15 April in Moscow and St. Petersburg is unworthy of a genuine member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe. The freedom of speech and freedom of the press are the cornerstones of a democratic State. The peoples of Europe, including the citizens of Russia, paid for these rights with their blood. It is therefore a disgrace that Putin’s Government, which lays claim to be a world power and offers its services as a mediator in all international conflicts while strutting like a peacock, is acting against its own people in such a cowardly and violent manner. Such a government cannot negotiate with us at eye level or as a partner having equal rights. Freedom is always the freedom to dissent. This should be impressed on the Russian Government.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin with a special word of thanks to Commissioner Špidla for his remarks on the subject of information and consultation of workers. We all know how much importance attaches to workers’ participatory rights as a source of good industrial relations and as the basis of a contented and motivated workforce. That is why these rights are also, and indeed particularly, in the interests of companies and employers. We in Europe can be proud of our tradition of worker participation. These rights feature prominently among our economic success factors. Although consultation rights vary between Member States of the EU – in the country I come from, for instance, worker participation extends to a right of codetermination in the realm of business management – information and consultation rights are undoubtedly part of what we call the European social model. The European Works Council Directive of 1994 is acknowledged as the pinnacle of Community legislation in this field. By common accord, it has proved its worth too; one token of its necessity was the fact that some companies with operations in several countries had voluntarily established works councils even before the Directive entered into force. I also believe that now, in 2007, the time has come to revise the Directive. The 1994 Directive had actually designated 1999 as the revision date. There have been many changes since the Directive was enacted. Corporate economic structures have changed, and globalisation has made further advances, but the expectations of employees and those who represent their interests have grown too. As representatives of the people in Europe, we shall gladly play our part in adapting the rules to the changes in the world of business and employment, for we all know that the only successful employers of the future will be those who act responsibly and with due regard to the rights and welfare of their employees, while well-informed employees who are involved in corporate decision-making processes will give of their best and be committed to the success of their company.

 In today’s vote on the discharge to the Commission for the 2005 Budget, I voted against it being given discharge on the grounds that the Court of Auditors has issued no Statement of Assurance in respect of this year, any more than it did for the years before it. This amounts to a statement that prudent and efficient use of funds is no more guaranteed than it has been in previous years. As is well known, Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, has stated his intention that an unconditional Statement of Assurance should be achieved by 2009, and it is clear to me from the discharge given today that no visible steps have been taken to that end.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs has tried, through in-depth debate, to be consistent in setting out the legal problems that the services directive throws up, not least in relation to health services, and on which the Commission will no doubt also have something to say. The lead committee – that on employment and social affairs – has largely taken our proposals on board, and for that I have to say that I am grateful. We saw it as important that we should put on record the considerable doubts in the Committee on Legal Affairs’s mind as to whether a European regulation can actually improve social services for the public where they are, and we have the same doubts as regards its efficiency. In any case, any regulation considered by the Commission must have an unambiguous legal basis, and we do not believe that Article 16 of the European Communities Treaty can serve as one in this instance, which is, in the Committee on Legal Affairs’ view, a classic example of where the subsidiarity principle should apply. At Member State level, social services take the most diverse forms, having developed in line with their own traditions and being funded in wholly different ways. Subsequently, the Committee on Legal Affairs decided that the subsidiarity principle meant that it was for the Member States alone to define what social services of general interest actually are, and this is another important point that was incorporated into the report. The obvious consequence of this is that the Commission cannot claim any right to lay down definitions by, for example, pointing to differing interpretations of concepts in the case law of the Court of Justice and elsewhere. I also want to draw the House’s attention to the contradiction between paragraphs 12 and 16 in the justification, of which we have taken note and which we have therefore not incorporated into the text of the report.
 Gabriele Stauner (PPE-DE

draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market
. – (DE)
 Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, even though it has been enshrined in the European Communities Treaty ever since Maastricht, the subsidiarity principle leads a shadowy existence, yet subsidiarity must always apply except where power resides solely at the European level. Such is indisputably not the case as regards the services we are discussing today, so any European regulation in this field would be a flagrant breach of the subsidiarity principle, and, moreover, of the principles – integral to the rule of law – of necessity and proportionality if there was any interference in the functioning structures that the Member States have developed over the years. If, though, the EU has no powers in this area, it follows that there can be no Europe-wide definition of these services either, and that only those who enact national or regional laws can define what they are. Quite apart from that, the White Paper’s attempted definitions of them – which I regard as artificial and cumbersome – reveal themselves as impractical and incomprehensible by the public. No strategy – be it of Lisbon or of anywhere else – is capable of being a substitute for a legal basis, whether one is dealing with principles and targets such as competition, or with economic and social cooperation. The only possible outcome of this debate, then, is a call to have nothing to do with any European regulation on services of general interest, quite simply because there is no European legal basis for one. I ask you to endorse the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which makes for a Europe that is close to its citizens, transparent and understandable.

 I abstained from the vote on the report on the thematic strategy on the urban environment. The report tries to destroy the subsidiarity principle. Nevertheless, I considered it unjustified to completely reject the report, because the majority of it describes existing regulations, calls for the sharing of experience between cities and simply calls on the European Commission to issue guidelines. Particularly in the new Member States, it is absolutely vital to improve the urban environment by means of such measures.

 Mr President, the background is as follows. With the Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament's powers will substantially increase again, and in view of this increase in powers, it is particularly important for us to carry out a precise analysis of the legislative process once more. As we do so, we see that interest representatives – or lobbyists, as they are often called – also play a very significant role in Brussels. We estimate that there are as many as 15 000 interest representatives working in Brussels, of which 5 000 are already registered with the European Parliament. Our task, then, is to establish a framework in which lobbying activities can be conducted in a fair and acceptable way. Parliament has maintained its own quasi-obligatory register of lobbyists from as long ago as 1996, as well as a very precise code of conduct. The task now is to see whether a similar arrangement can be achieved for all the European institutions. The contents of the report to be voted on today therefore represent an important step towards more transparency: in other words, towards the provision of accurate information about who has participated as a lobbyist – an interest representative – in the development of European legislation, how they have done so, and in which areas. Secondly, we wish to establish ethical and moral standards governing these lobbying activities. Thirdly, there must be proper safeguards in place to ensure the independence of the political decision-making process in Parliament and the Commission. Lobbying activities must be removed from the grey area, as it were, so that we have a clear and factual picture of where influence is genuinely being brought to bear. We have therefore introduced the following elements into the report, which are new features compared with the previous situation: firstly, a relatively wide-ranging definition of what lobbying means, or what it is, namely 'activities carried out with the objective of influencing the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the EU institutions'. The second new feature is the introduction of a 'legislative footprint'. This would mean that when a new directive is deliberated and adopted in a parliamentary committee, the committee secretariat would annex a page to the document listing which associations had participated in the debate and whether they did so in the framework of a public hearing or other type of meeting. This list should also help the interest groups themselves to see who was involved in the process, and who did not wish, or was unable, to participate. Thirdly, our aim is to establish a common register for interest representatives in the EU institutions. It remains to be seen whether this really will happen with the Commission and Parliament. We intend to set up a working group to look at this issue. It would of course be easier for all lobbyists if we could get a kind of 'one-stop shop' where they could register and sign up to indicate that they intend to comply with the rules. That is the aim, but as the rapporteur, I must say that I am not certain at this stage whether we really will get a common register. At any rate, the registers need to be linked up so that it is a straightforward process, in terms of the bureaucracy involved, to set up this common register. Paragraph 21 also talks about the requirement of financial disclosure, which would be an entirely new element. We also talk about the option of sanctions which should apply to lobbyists who breach the code of conduct. Here, we have to consider what kind of sanctions we want. The Greens' idea is to have a black list, but in my view, this is reminiscent of a pillory in the Middle Ages. Black lists are really not appropriate in a democracy. What we would want instead is for inclusion in the register to confer such a high degree of prestige that serious-minded associations will want their name to appear in the European institutions' official register. It must be a prestigious and desirable aspiration, not only because they are then issued with a pass to grant access to the institutions' premises, but also because inclusion in the register would be sought-after in its own right, signifying that the association concerned is recognised as an important and useful interlocutor which is taken seriously enough by the institutions to warrant inclusion in the register. In the event of misconduct, the association would be struck from the register and the pass would be withdrawn: that would be the sanction. Yes, I will be as brief as possible. It is important that church organisations should not be defined as lobbyists. I am very disappointed by Amendment 3. Mrs in 't Veld from the Liberal Group has said that churches should be lobbyists. That really would run counter to everything we have agreed in Parliament to date. According to the Treaties, the churches are partners for our institutions, but they are not lobbyists. Overall, my assessment is that this is a major step forward towards a situation which is more transparent, correct and fair. I hope that we will thus set an example that can be followed around the world, showing how lobbying can and should be taken seriously.

 Mr President, thank you for what has, for the most part, been a focused and well-informed debate. Serious and transparent lobbying activities help to enhance the efficiency of the decision-making process. Mr Turmes, you were not correct in what you said: financial disclosure is covered in paragraph 21. To that extent, you were wrong to attack the Socialist Group. I feel compelled to point that out. Secondly, as regards the issue of lawyers, we cannot make the sweeping assertion that every lawyer is by default a lobbyist because he or she has studied advocacy and all that it entails. We have the correct definition before us: anyone who seeks to influence the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the EU institutions is a lobbyist, and that includes lawyers. May I point out one error in the translation: 'municipalities' has been translated as 'Städte
' in German. The US system is very detailed; indeed, it is so detailed that some senators produce 300-page reports at the end of the year, with the result that it is almost impossible to gain a clear insight into what is really happening in terms of lobbying activities in the US. From my perspective, it was interesting that the ultra-left and the ultra-right virtually converge in their fundamental criticism. 'Les extrêmes se touchent'
, as the French would say, and this situation is typical. We want to arrive at a serious solution which is an improvement on what is happening in America, and also improves upon what is happening in most, or indeed all, of the Member States. Many thanks, once again, to Mr Stubb. Minister, we are thinking of you! Thank you, too, for the serious debate.

 Mr President, very briefly, this concerns the amendment of the Rules of Procedure in light of the new Statute from 2009. It strengthens the individual Member's right of initiative, creates more transparency, provides a clear definition of which files can be inspected, and offers what I believe to be an intelligent solution to the question of languages, so that the smaller languages will not be discriminated against. As we have not debated this issue, I think it is important that you should be informed about it. Thank you for your attention.

 Madam President, first of all, may I express my sincere congratulations and thanks to Mr Jo Leinen, the rapporteur, for doing a very good job. This report is one which my Group can fully support and we also endorse the amendments. The report turns political parties at European level, and the new instrument of political foundations, into effective tools to increase participation by Europe's citizens and boost Europe's democratic legitimacy. The referenda in France and the Netherlands showed that it is important to rebuild the trust of citizens, including via the political parties and the foundations. It is also true that the financial rules need to be adapted to the rapidly changing needs of the political parties. Transparency, of course, must be safeguarded as well. That is why the European Parliament will be providing information on the funding disbursed to parties and foundations every financial year, and this will be available on our website. Another good innovation is that the role of political parties in the context of the European elections is finally recognised. Only if Europe's parties can be actively involved in elections to the European Parliament will they become genuine players of the European polis and contribute to the formation of a European consciousness, thereby helping to overcome the democratic deficit which exists. Another important component is the promotion of political foundations. Their work in the field of political information and education complements what the political parties do. These foundations have a special role to play in deepening the educational process and enhancing knowledge about the European Union, thus reducing the distance between citizens and the European Union. I am convinced that foundations can boost the active participation of citizens in European political life, and they can also play an important role in the training of tomorrow's politicians. The legalistic thinking of the Council is rather hard to fathom, but as Helmut Kohl always said, the most important thing is the outcome. That is why I am in favour of this report, and I would like to thank everyone concerned for their commitment and cooperation.

Madam President, we have a free vote in our group, so I have no authority to speak for all my colleagues. We are again discussing the basic question whether a parliamentary service is worth the money or whether we must tighten our belt in response to the imperative of cutting costs. Let me say at the outset that I also regard the new concept of video presentation as a good idea which should not be jettisoned. Those people who want to have an immediate impression of our parliamentary proceedings can do so, and that is right and proper. In my opinion, however, that is not enough, because the archiving of written records is quite simply an essential service. Let me give you four reasons. Firstly, all of the world’s parliaments make their plenary debates available in written form and archive them so that people can consult the records to find out what has been discussed in Parliament. Secondly, the video recording conveys a vivid and very interesting impression, but we also know that the hectic nature of proceedings often results in oral translations falling short of the quality we need. We know this internally from our dealings with the tabling office. We set up a tabling office ourselves to ensure that the formulation of motions and official documentation was absolutely correct. Because we operate so multilingually, we must exercise particular care. We want to continue taking the same care with our records of proceedings. Thirdly, the researchers who expressed their views on this subject may not have been fully aware of the implications, for although they might obtain a lively record, there is an underlying lack of rigour in the proposed approach. Besides, it is far easier to analyse a plenary debate if the researcher can enter a term, be it ‘pesticides’ or ‘CO2
’, and be directed immediately to a debate on the matter in question. It would seem that this cannot be done with video recordings. In short, I believe that keeping written records represents value for money, and I am in favour of written archives in addition to video recordings.

Mr President, the report provides clarification for which I would like to express my sincere thanks to both rapporteurs, Messrs Lamassoure and Severin. It makes clear that we are constantly exceeding the stipulated upper and lower limits. I would like to express my thanks specifically for this. This clarification is important for us all. Secondly, there are two outcomes to this report. Firstly, the less degressive the scale we have, that is, the more we gear ourselves to proportionality, the more genuine authority and legitimacy Parliament has. The conflict as to how much degressivity we need – how much less, how much more – must be continually managed and it is logical here, I believe, for us to say the less the degressivity, the greater the legitimacy. As a German, I would also add that it is somewhat problematic, of course, that we as Germans are the only ones getting less than we did on the basis of Nice. We would like a little bit more support here because the discussion in the German press is very explicit in this regard. We shall accept this because we too believe that the European aspect is more important than all the others. Finally, two findings which we ought to utilise for the future. Firstly, we really ought to be working towards obtaining a logical system in the long-term, which we do not have to be constantly renegotiating. Secondly, there are two controversial amendments, 2 and 3. Our Group has decided that irrespective of how the vote goes on the two controversial subjects, in the end the Group will vote in favour of the Lamassoure/Severin Report. The Council has no excuse. In Amendment 2, which differs only minimally from the figures in the Lamassoure Report, the outcome would be that the Council is given a message from Parliament for the period 2009–2014. Hence our Parliament and all the Groups have on balance, as I believe, fulfilled their duties and the Council can decide, if it is willing. Many thanks for a fair discussion on such a difficult subject!
 President.  
 We have voted on Amendment 44, and the original text has in fact been accepted.
 President.  
 That concludes the vote.
 President.  
 Your desire to express another view at this point will be mentioned in the Minutes.
 President.  
 Thank you, Mr Posselt, for your kind words.

 Mr President, we are therefore looking at these two amendments. What are the reasons for the change in the number of Quaestors? When Parliament had 500 Members, we had five Quaestors, in other words, virtually one for every 100 MEPs. If we stuck with that ratio with the proposed 780 Members, we would have a very high number. If, as the Committee has suggested, we increase the number of Quaestors to six, that would be one Quaestor for every 130 Members of the House, still a larger number than was for many years the case. I believe that the complexity of developments and of the problems that will arise in the House with 25 languages – I am now including Catalan and Irish, for example – that this complexity affecting the conduct of business and decisions justifies increasing that number from five to six for a time. The same applies to the increase in the number of committee vice-chairmen. It is an indisputable fact that, so far as anyone can judge, we will now from January 2007 to the middle of 2009 have the largest number of Members this Parliament is ever planned to have. This unusually large number of MEPs suggests that, or is the reason why, a larger number of elected representatives will be appointed to the committees for the same period. It is of course not only to do with the conduct of business but also with the fact that people are already in these posts and the new Bulgarian and Romanian Members are now coming, who are of course also entitled to such positions. We would have to take them away from existing Members and give them to new ones. From a formal, legal point of view that is of course possible, but it would not be conducive to, let us say, committed internal parliamentary work. There would be frustrations and disappointments, which can be avoided by taking this approach. I grant that one thing has perhaps not gone as well as it might. We could and perhaps should have recognised this six months earlier. That would have made it easier to talk these things through quietly with all the parliamentary groups. The fact that this idea unfortunately occurred to those responsible only very late in the day made it look as though a sitting had to be held on Monday and a vote taken on it on Thursday. I ask for your forbearance. It can happen in political life that you hit upon a good idea later than events really require. I ask for your understanding for that and readily admit that many honourable Members found this fact rather hard to understand. There was no ill intent behind it, no funny business; only when the new situation became clear did we suddenly find there was a new problem we had not seen before. To sum up, I believe this compromise of creating an extra post in two areas for a limited period while making clear that we will return to normal at the end of that period is a reasonable proposal that will be good for the conduct of parliamentary business and I ask for your agreement and understanding.

 Ladies and gentlemen, before the vote, I would like to announce an important statement by our Conference of Presidents. The statement concerns the arrest of opposition figures in the run-up to the presidential elections in Belarus. On 16 March, the Conference of Presidents noted that a growing number of opposition politicians, journalists and NGO activists have been arrested in Belarus. The Conference of Presidents regrets these measures, which massively call into question the democratic nature of the elections and are contrary to all democratic principles. Seventeen names now follow. With your permission, I will read the 17 names aloud, because we can only expect and hope that this will have any effect if they are mentioned by name here in the European Parliament. They are the following persons: Siarhiej Malčyk Viktar Sazonau Vadzim Sarančukou Andrej Pisalnik Mikoła Lemianouski Alaksiej Trubkin Siaržuk Hudzilin Jauhien Vaukauviec Aleś Čyrejka Vital Brouka Vasil Leučanka Tatsiana Klimovič Dzimitry Šymanski Ryhor Bakijevič Anatol Labiedźka Siarhiej Niarouny Vincuk Viačorka Four further persons have been arrested in Pinsk, including Mr Pavieł Lachnovič, and a further six persons in Svietłahorsk. The Conference of Presidents calls for these persons’ immediate release. (Loud, sustained applause)

 Mr President, I should like to discuss the purpose of these Rules of Procedure and what has changed in them. Their purpose is to fully ensure liveliness and spontaneity, whilst enabling Members to be called to order in cases of genuinely malicious, continuous disruption of the smooth conduct of parliamentary business. These have been redefined and aspects of the rules that had hitherto been couched in very non-specific terms have been clarified: that is, the difference between the ‘normal’ Chair, the Chairman of a delegation or committee, or a Vice-President chairing this plenary assembly, and the one President – who is of course present in person today. The ‘normal’ Chair may issue a reprimand, exclude from the Chamber a Member guilty of continuous disruption, and suspend a sitting, but the really unpleasant penalties may only be imposed by the President. At first it sounds surprising that the President alone, without plenary, may impose an effective penalty thus, but this is corrected or balanced out by the introduction of a right of appeal, so that Members who consider that they have been unfairly treated by the President may appeal and any penalty wrongfully imposed can then be rectified. A genuinely new aspect is that breaches of the rules governing confidentiality may now also be penalised. Another new aspect is that there has been some increase in the possible penalties. Up to now, it has been possible to suspend a Member from his or her duties for two to five days, but the new period would be between two and ten days. I share Mr Onesta’s opinion that this is a balanced draft, a proposal that permits liveliness and nevertheless ensures the smooth conduct of business. Our group will therefore support this proposal.
 President.  
 The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 12 noon. (The sitting was suspended at 11.45 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.)
 President.  
 Yesterday’s minutes have been circulated. Are there any objections?
 President.  
 That will be corrected, Mr Poignant.
 President.   
Mr Rübig, that has already been discussed at yesterday’s meeting of the Bureau. Fifteen police officers were injured and 20 window panes smashed. We discussed the security aspects and also how the damage may be made good. (The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved.)
 President.  
 We now come to the statements by the Council and the Commission on the security of energy supply – and in particular that of gas.
 President.  
 If we approve this, the consequence will be that it will be debated on Wednesday evening, with an opportunity to table amendments tomorrow – which is Wednesday – until 10 in the morning, and the vote on the report itself would be on Thursday. We have now heard one intervention in favour of that, and now is the opportunity for someone to speak against it.
 President.  
 The next item is the joint debate on: –	the report (A6-0396/2005

 by Mr Becsey, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive laying down detailed rules for the refund of value added tax, provided for in Directive 77/388/EEC, to taxable persons not established in the territory of the country but established in another Member State (COM(2004)0728
 – C6-0251/2005

 – B6-0342/2005
).
 President.  
 I would remind Mr Whittaker that worldwide surveys indicate that Europe is the most attractive region in the world as a whole. Most of the world’s people would rather live in Europe, even preferring it to America. It follows that the European system cannot be that bad!
 President.  
 The first thing I can tell you about that is that the possibility of some sort of instruction from within Parliament can be ruled out with absolute certainty. We cannot exclude the possibility that the French taxi drivers’ organisations have been up to something. There will be official consultations about this, and the administration will be able to deal with it immediately.
 President.  
 The next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors’ annual report for 2004.

 President.  
 Your proposals have been noted, as has your stated intention of, in due course, bringing this matter before such bodies as the Conference of Presidents.
 President.  
 The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0276/2005
) by Mr Mavrommatis, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2004 (2005/2136(INI)).

 The debate is closed. The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m. (The sitting was suspended at 11.25 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.)
 President.  
 Mr Bushill-Matthews, your concern is quite justified, and the President has already written to the Council to criticise this state of affairs in emphatic and vigorous terms. We expect the Council to maintain the arrangements that have been customary for years, indeed for decades. It is absolutely unacceptable that these things should be dealt with in the manner that you describe, and we have already taken the matter up. (The Minutes of the previous part-session were approved)
 President.

 President.  
 Ladies and gentlemen, the House having voted on China today, I now have the great honour to welcome the members of the delegation of parliamentarians from the People’s Republic of China who are visiting us on the occasion of the 22nd EP/China Inter-Parliamentary Meeting. A very warm welcome to the delegation from the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China under the chairmanship of Mr Wang! (Applause)
 Honourable members of the Chinese National People’s Congress, you will be aware that dialogue between Europe and China is of crucial importance in terms of continuing globalisation.
 President.  
 I put it to you that you should take part in one of the delegations’ sittings. You will yourself be aware that the sending of delegations appointed in accordance with national rules is something that national sovereignty makes possible.
 President.  
 Mr Swoboda, I asked that very question when we were preparing for the vote, and was told that we had to make some allowances, as the situation in Ethiopia was changing practically by the hour.
 President.  
 That concludes the vote.
 President.  
 The Minutes of this part-session will be put before the House at the beginning of the next. In the absence of any objections to them, I will forward the adopted text to the intended recipients.
 President.  
 I declare the session of the European Parliament to be suspended. (The sitting was closed at 12.15 p.m.)
 President.  
 Ladies and gentlemen, although our esteemed visitors in the galleries are most welcome and ought of course to share in the liveliness of the debate, I would ask them to bear in mind that – following the practice of parliaments all over the world – we ask the listeners in the galleries not to applaud. Only the Members may do that. You may, however, nod energetically, provided this is not audible. I thank the visitors in the galleries for their understanding and warmly welcome them.
 President.  
 Before I call the Commissioner, perhaps I might be permitted a personal comment. I have been a Member of this House for some time, and rarely have I experienced such an interesting and committed debate, but it is one that I also regard as an example of Europeanisation and globalisation. Only a few years ago, when we spoke in terms of ‘us’, each of us meant his or her own nation, and, even so, we had exactly the same problems with mutual recognition, designations of origin, certification, and mandatory labelling. All these things we once fought long and hard to secure for Europe, and now it seems that we have to do the same again for a global market that has shrunk. The American Professor Jeremy Rifkin is quite right to say that Europeans are best equipped, by reason of these laborious experiences of things that the world is now having to get to grips with, to deal with these problems, for we have been through them already and know how they need to be addressed. Now, Commissioner, we are all agog to learn how you propose to sort out the problems with wine. Everyone present – including the spectators – knows how important wine is to their own winegrowers. How, then, Commissioner, are we to solve these problems?
 President.  
 We all hope that you will succeed in defending Europeans’ interests on this occasion. At the close of this debate I have received six motions for a resolution(1)
 submitted pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure. The debate is therefore closed. The vote will take place on Thursday, 29 September, at 12 noon. The sitting will now be suspended until the beginning of the vote. To those who may be asking why we are doing this rather earlier than usual, I will say that the Bureau has discussed how we might avoid the situation that always occurs at 12.00, 12.05 or 12.10 p.m., with the representatives of the Council of Ministers or the Commission having to talk rather over the noise of all the Members pouring into the Chamber for the vote. We have therefore agreed to experiment with closing the debate at 11.50 a.m., so that the debate can proceed without disturbance. It is for that reason that we now have a bit more time than usual. (The sitting was suspended at 11.45 a.m. and resumed at the beginning of the vote at 12.05 p.m.)
 President.  
 The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0244/2005

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue with which my report is concerned is fundamentally different in character from the things we have just heard addressed. It is not about how we deal with weapons at the international level, or about arms limitation, but rather about whether we want to make it possible for the procurement of military equipment to be liberalised within the European single market. I would like to start by expressing my very warm gratitude for the input provided by those Members who had a hand in drawing up the report, whether as rapporteur in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or as shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. My discussions and conversations with them have been a source of very useful suggestion, which have been incorporated into the report. I also want to thank the Commission for its very good cooperation, which involved it being willing to delay the adoption of the subsequent White Paper until after we had delivered our opinion. I am also grateful to the interested parties for taking part in our hearings and thereby helping to prepare the sector for these changes. The topic is a decidedly delicate one, as the procurement of military equipment can be said to touch upon the very heart of national sovereignty. It was for that reason that the Treaty establishing the European Community, back in the 1950s, included a derogation clause safeguarding the interests of national security. Over the past decade, though, we have, progressively and continuously, moved closer together even on fundamental matters of security policy, and the debate on the two preceding reports is a demonstration of how we, in these areas, are taking a fundamentally global approach to policy. The procurement market within the European Union remains, however, utterly fragmented, with every country having its own preferred suppliers and purveyors by appointment. Instead of competition, there is a fragmentation that prevents our industry from being competitive internationally and entails very high costs in the purchase of military equipment that might be available on more favourable terms elsewhere, and that is a burden on the wallets of the taxpayers who, ultimately, have to pay for it all. It was for that reason that we, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Foreign Affairs arrived, on parallel lines, at the conclusion that the time has come for us to venture a bold step. We endorse the Commission’s proposal that this derogation clause, Article 296, should be clarified and made more precise, and we do so because we have established that it is widely abused. This clause is used as a pretext for removing practically the whole of the military equipment procurement sector from the internal market. There is a black hole in the internal market, and that with a total expenditure of EUR 160 billion per annum. We want the public to get the message that the mutual opening-up of procurement markets testifies, among other things, to the Member States’ trust in one another. Let us – we want to say to them – take a step forward that will make it possible for state expenditure to be cut back, and let us set in motion a process that will eventually make us more competitive and perhaps even enable us to free ourselves to some degree from certain dependencies on suppliers outside Europe! I need only mention the current procurement arrangements for the refuelling of aircraft or for guided missiles, where we are largely dependent on supplies from other markets. Let me conclude with a few brief words on the amendments that have been submitted. I believe that the key to our reaching a common mind without regard to party boundaries on this matter has been that we said at the very outset that we would concentrate on the issue of the single market and would not allow the discussion to get bogged down in general policy issues relating to security, the armed forces and peacemaking. The result of this has been that Mrs Beer, from the Greens, and I, as a member of the CSU, began the deliberations with largely identical reports. These amendments, which are somewhat ideological in character, have made them less so. I therefore recommend that you endorse the report, but vote for none of the amendments except Amendment 5.

 I very much welcome the result of the vote on the correction of Directive 2004/18/EC of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts. In order to adjust threshold values in the award of public works contracts, the correction of this clerical error was necessary. I would however like to observe that there is still, in my view, a need for improvement in the substance of some of the Directive’s provisions, particularly in those relating to cooperation between municipalities and to the establishment of associations for a particular purpose by boroughs. Mandatory tendering for such forms of cooperation is not practical, goes against the objectives of the directive and prevents boroughs from providing public-friendly services at a reasonable price. I therefore regard it as urgently necessary that the directive be revised on the basis of practical experience at the beginning of 2006 in order to give attention to this matter. I am glad that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has already decided to consult interested parties about this.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the value of innovations and the importance of the knowledge-based society have often been affirmed in this Chamber. We have been told that the intellect will come up trumps for us, that it is the trump card that Europe can play in an increasingly global economy. Every bit as important, though, as the development of this intellect is, of course, the prevention of the theft of our ideas by others. Imagine an inventor investing, over two years, millions of euros in an invention, only for someone, three months later, to produce a copy of the invention, put it on the market and rob the inventor of the rewards of his labour. Patents protect the weak; they protect inventors against those who wield market power. Patents decide in the intellect’s favour when it contends with the power of the market, and they do without reference to the size of the business concerned. I am far from satisfied with the way this debate has gone over recent weeks. We have ended up with an over-heated atmosphere, with an unparalleled lobbyists’ feud, and we have to admit, if we are honest, that what we in essence have to do, even though we have got as far as second reading, is to take decisions about a multiplicity of wordings, and that we are, at this stage, able only to a limited extent to gauge the likely ramifications of the many positions that have been taken up. The Committee on Legal Affairs has made forty amendments to less than ten articles. We have dozens more amendments to consider, and have scarcely any idea what their effects will be. It has slowly dawned on me that the time is not yet ripe for a decision on this dossier, and we really should consider the possibility of rejecting the Common Position and thereby bringing the legislative process to a temporary halt. If it were possible to do that, that might be the most responsible decision we could take at this stage.

 Mr President, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow’s vote on the recast directive will draw a line under the very in-depth discussions in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, and so I am sure you will understand how much Mrs Niebler regrets her inability – due to a close family bereavement – to be present at this debate. She has asked me to make this statement on her behalf, and I ask the House’s indulgence for that. Mrs Niebler is grateful to all of you for the good and fair cooperation in the Committee while preparing this important report. What the Commission has proposed in this instance is a rather tricky tightrope walk between a mere consolidation of current legislation and a partial improvement of the existing regulations with the intention of drafting them in more comprehensible terms, modernising and simplifying them, while also incorporating into the consolidated text the case-law of the European Court of Justice. Speaking as a former member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I myself can do no other than endorse that objective. What Europe demands in this area needs to be expressed more transparently, more comprehensively and with greater clarity, and it is for that reason that we support this approach. It is no secret that this proposal has arrived at a time when the process of transposing Community decisions in the Member States is the subject of decidedly vehement debate – I need mention only the over-heated debate in Germany, where the Red/Green government is, indeed, facing political defeat for going far beyond what Europe requires, but that is not the point at issue. This directive concerns itself solely with the equal rights of men and women at work, something that is at the very heart of European equality policy, and its being a matter for the European Union to deal with is not a matter of dispute. After decades spent working towards equality, how do things stand now? Despite our efforts at equality in the world of work, we can see that there is still a gender gap, amounting to some 16% of wages. Men are twice as likely to occupy positions of leadership and three times as likely to be at the top of companies. At the highest decision-making levels of the 50 largest listed companies, the proportion of women amounts to a mere 10%. Three subject areas gave rise to lively debate in the Committee. For a start, various members demanded that the directive should include reference to parental leave, but Mrs Niebler has taken the view that the use of this recasting to bring about such a fundamental change in European law is not opportune. The fact that rules differ so widely from one Member State to another – with parental leave varying from three months to three years – means that extending the directive to cover it would entail enormous changes and make both in-depth debate and an impact assessment necessary. It is therefore worth supporting the compromise that we have come up with, according to which the social partners, who are already doing something about this, are urged to review the existing regulations with this in mind. The second subject of critical scrutiny in debate was what are known as the ‘unisex tariffs’. At one point, the Committee, by a very narrow majority, expressed itself in favour of the idea that the distinction drawn between men and women in occupational pension schemes should be done away with, but Mrs Niebler has warned, in no uncertain terms, against resuming this debate at this stage, for it was only a few months ago that, after protracted negotiations, a very well thought-out compromise was reached in relation to provision for old age. Mrs Niebler regards it as very important that this should be mentioned, for, if we now reopen the debate on the ‘unisex tariffs’, a highly politically controversial issue, then there is the risk of the recasting directive being lost as a result of our expecting too much of this process of consolidating legislation currently in force. The same argument holds good in respect of the third issue, namely our call for more pressure to be exerted on the Member States and the social partners to get them to improve matters. Let us not, then, put the whole directive at risk by weighing it down with substantial demands; that the law should be clear and comprehensible is of value in itself. That is what the directive aims at, and I ask you to help enable it to bring that about.

 This directive does not, as yet, provide a satisfactory solution to a problem that exists with regard to German professional qualifications. Following amendments to German legislation, the directive will mean that the German qualifications of journeyman (‘Geselle
’) and master craftsman (‘Meister
’) will be placed in the same category, even though master craftsmen are required to complete a demanding additional training course that lasts many years. It would still be possible to add the qualification of master craftsman to a higher-ranking category, however, by including it in Annex II of the directive. We have voted in favour of the compromise in the hope that the ‘Committee on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications’, which will be responsible for such matters according to Article 58 of the directive, will comply with this request before the deadline for transposition.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in the congratulations addressed to Mrs Bresso. To be sure, it is no easy matter to take over such a brief in mid-stream, and, while carrying on with what Mrs Ghilardotti had begun, you have added your own emphases, and I have to say I admire the way you have been able to hold your own in the trialogue, a place where predatory beasts dwell. We did not always agree about everything, but I would like to stress at the very outset that I am very glad that you have succeeded in keeping this directive flexible in its application. The eastward enlargement has of course given us a much more heterogeneous range of consumers, as well as far more diverse ways of doing business, and I am glad that that has been taken into account by allowance being made for local circumstances in the interpretation of the directive in individual cases. This, though, also means that it is important that Article 4 should provide that the Member States may not restrict the free movement of services and goods on the grounds of unfair trade practices. As I understand it, this also means that a decision taken in one Member State on the legitimacy of a business practice cannot be questioned in another. I think this comment is an important point of reference for the courts who will have to interpret this in future. I am glad to see, Commissioner Kyprianou, that you have given pride of place in your work programme to the transposition of European rules and regulations. This directive is one where putting good thinking and ideas into practice will be difficult. The internal market is meant to be one for fair competition between upright and honourable business people, and by means of this directive we are ensuring that this it what it becomes.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that this substantial report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo has been tabled. As a former substitute member of the Convention, I must admit that I might recommend to some people that they read this report rather than the Constitution itself, as it is supremely readable and extremely convincing on the issue. Today I should like to address my comments to those Members of this House who have taken a critical approach to the Constitution. They have warned against the creation of a European superstate and denounced shortcomings, and they have come out in opposition to mistakes made in the past. I believe we should make it very clear to them that this European Constitution is in fact a way of addressing these shortcomings. The European Constitution remedies many of the problems that all of us have experienced with Europe as it exists today. It lays down a system of competences and grants national parliaments the right of participation, thus making Europe less centralist and less bureaucratic. The Constitution gives the European Parliament a full say, and Europe will therefore become more democratic than it has been to date. It also strengthens citizens’ rights, above all by means of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as citizens will be able to invoke the Constitution directly when appealing against European decisions. Finally, the Constitution provides this Europe of ours with a basis of values, and is thus a way of countering the technocratic approach to political problems. The Eurosceptics should therefore really be in favour of this Constitution, as it is the only way of changing the things we all wish to change. Today is the anniversary of the birth of Alexander Hamilton, one of the fathers of the American Constitution, whose picture can today be found on ten-dollar notes. As I look at the fathers and mothers of the European Constitution in this House, I hope that they will also be remembered as gratefully in 200 years’ time.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that this legislative period finds us continuing our lawmaking efforts with something that is actually one of this House’s success stories; it is, in particular, one of Mr Rothley’s. The fact is that this House played a decisive part in bringing this legislation into being, and so it is only proper that we, in the last stage of the lawmaking process, should be pressing for further improvements to it. Although it is a pity that solid benefits for the public should be concealed behind positively technocratic expressions like the ‘Fifth Directive relating to insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles’, this should not prevent us from giving these successes the publicity they deserve, for we are dealing here with truly tragic cases of people who, through a road accident, have lost the wherewithal for their economic survival, their ability to work, who have been ruined by court cases lasting decades, quite simply because the accident occurred in another Member State. What is most important is that this amending directive manages to increase the minimum cover from EUR 350 000 to EUR 1 million, to abolish derogations and improve the regime for service representatives. One of the consequences of the internal market, of course, is that people move around more, whether they be students, tourists or engaged in providing services, and to all of these we are giving a bit more security when they cross a border in their motor vehicle. The security we are giving them is that they are, to a substantial extent, still covered by insurance when they are away from home. What made the previous directives so successful was surely the fact that we created an unbureaucratic, uncomplicated and straightforward system, and that helped to reduce the flood of paperwork. I do, though, take Commissioner McCreevy’s call very seriously when I say that we must re-examine very thoroughly whether all the amendments we have proposed do not make matters too complex, bureaucratic and more difficult. I do not, for example, think it makes any sense whatsoever to include trailers in the definition at the same time as making it possible for the Member States to make insurance of them optional. I also ask myself whether this directive is the right place for rules on legal costs, limitation periods and so on, when it is actually meant to deal with other cases. Although I would regard it as sensible to have an Internet site as the central source of information for accident victims, I do not imagine that a collection of accident reports in their hundreds and thousands, or even in ones and twos, on a single Internet site is something that members of the public will regard as practical or will be of real use to them.

 Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen. I, too, will gladly do my bit towards our becoming the most modern parliament in the world, even though my contribution, in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, will be a modest one. In considering the Budget, we set clear priorities, particularly with regard to the Lisbon agenda. Concrete initiatives to push forward the Lisbon agenda, including in this Budget procedure, are more important than a constant succession of statements, whether by the Heads of State and Government, or sometimes by us ourselves, that cost those who make them nothing. We still regard the internal market as being at the heart of our competition strategy, and, seeing as there has been no change in the obstacles to it, we have proposed allocating funds to the holding of another forum on the internal market in order to discuss the various minor obstacles remaining in the internal market with those who are affected by them, thus enabling us to fashion forward-looking legislative instruments to deal with them. We in the Internal Market Committee also regard the eastward enlargement as potentially crucial in promoting growth, prosperity and employment, but we do of course also see that there are still difficulties involved in getting economies to grow together across borders. For that reason, we are proposing a pilot project for the formation of clusters in the border regions, through which strategic alliances can be forged. We also regard the internal market for consumers as still having considerable potential for enhancing our competitiveness and have, to this end, allocated funds for the fields of food safety and the combating of diseases in animals. I myself would also like to extend warm thanks to Commissioner Schreyer for her cooperation. It is a fact of life that those responsible for the Budget may make a lot of enemies and annoy a lot of people, but they also make some friends. When it comes to the border regions, though, they have become friends, as has the rapporteur on our Budget, Mr Garriga Polledo, and for that many thanks.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while 10 of the 27 Member States are embroiled in an on-going court case due to their failure to transpose the first directive, we have today still seen a simple majority in this House vote to lay a second directive on top of the first. I, personally – along with the majority of my group – voted ‘no’. Why was that? I will mention two examples. From experience in my Franconian home, I know of the efforts of political extremists, neo-Nazis and left-wing radicals attempting to acquire property and thereby generate widespread publicity in their favour. If this is implemented, the equal treatment directive will mean that owners and our landlords will now, in some cases, have to make deals that they had hitherto been able to refuse. For that reason I voted against Mrs Buitenweg’s report today. Another reason is that, in the amendment today, we reversed the reversal of the burden of proof and with it a fundamental element of our state under the rule of law. I regard that as completely illegitimate. The third point relates to newspapers and publishers, whose freedom to refuse to publish items by extremists would be curtailed by this directive. That, in my view, is a clear intrusion on the freedom of the press and something that I therefore reject.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a journalist, I would like to draw attention to a change in this directive that is of great concern to me personally. Specifically, I find it incomprehensible that, when the directive has not yet been transposed in 10 out of 27 Member States, we are going a step further and trying to stick an additional directive on top of it. Opinions may be divided on that, which is fine, but what really disturbs me, as a journalist, is the fact that it is damaging the freedom of the press in the Member States. Let me give you two examples of this. Mr Weber’s proposed amendment, which merits our support, means that it will also be possible to limit the freedom of the press, for example, if a publisher is required to accept an advertisement from neo-Nazis or anti-Semites. I think that is totally inappropriate and goes completely against the principles we have in the EU, and I object strongly to it. We cannot allow this to happen. The same applies, of course, if we have anti-discrimination; then people who we do not want to encourage in the EU, but rather need to take action against, will have even more opportunities, for example in the property market. In my homeland, we see neo-Nazis trying to buy property almost on a weekly basis. If property is being rented or sold, we cannot prevent left-wing or right-wing extremists from taking it. They will make use of this new amendment, and I object strongly to this and will vote against it. I am therefore in favour of supporting referral back to committee or, if this is impossible, of voting against it.

The current financial and economic crisis poses massive challenges for the automotive and supply industry. Sales figures are falling and many factories have suspended production until the end of the year. In Germany, every seventh job depends directly or indirectly on car manufacture. One important policy objective must be to create framework conditions to protect jobs in Germany even in times of crisis. The regulation has therefore come along at completely the wrong time. I am sorry that the report tabled does not create incentives to stem emissions. This would, in my opinion, have been the right approach to climate change, including in times of economic crisis. The threat of horrendous penalties is not a solution. I am therefore of the opinion that private agendas are being pursued here to the detriment of the German economy. What is important to me is to promote protection of the climate, but not to the detriment of individual EU Member States. This regulation hits not only German car manufacturers themselves, but also, above all, the mostly medium-sized suppliers, many of which are located in the Nürnberg Metropolitan Region. As a new MEP for Nürnberg, I cannot therefore vote in favour of this report.
