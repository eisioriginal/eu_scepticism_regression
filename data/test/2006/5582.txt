 Madam President, as one of the other co-sponsors of the original written declaration nearly three years ago, which called for this ban, I should like to congratulate everyone who has worked to bring this draft proposal forward. Four hundred and twenty-five Members of this House signed that declaration, reflecting the strength of feeling about the issue, not only among MEPs but also among our constituents. Today, nearly one million seals are slaughtered annually in commercial seal kills around the world, and when we vote on this package tomorrow we will be helping to end one of the most vile examples of animal cruelty. I am very glad that compromises, like the proposed labelling system, have been strongly rejected, so that we can fully meet the demands of millions of European citizens. A positive vote will be a vote for ending cruelty. It will also be a vote and a victory for all of us who have refused to take ‘no’ for an answer. I well remember many meetings with Commission officials when we were told that a ban would be simply impossible. Well, this just shows that when we can galvanise sufficient political will – and I pay tribute to the NGOs which have helped us to do so – then impossible things become possible, and I am delighted that they do.

 Mr President, I cannot hide the fact that this report has been a serious disappointment to those of us who thought that a rapporteur who was also the president of the animal welfare intergroup might have reflected that concern for animals rather more diligently in his report. It is therefore essential that some crucial amendments are adopted when we vote on this. In particular, the scope of authorisation must apply to all projects, not just to severe and moderate ones. If we fail to ensure that, it will mean that many procedures causing pain, distress or suffering would no longer be subject to a centrally monitored ethical review and that in turn would effectively undermine the enforcement of many of the measures set out in the proposal as a whole. But, if our amendments are passed, it will mean that there will be renewed effort going into research and the alternatives to animal testing, which is particularly critical in basic and medical research. Current efforts are concentrated on regulatory testing, which accounts for only 10% of animal use. For the sake of both the animals and human health, it is essential that more modern, effective non-animal tests come into use as soon as possible.

 Mr President, the G20 was a massively missed opportunity for tackling both the environmental crisis and the economic crisis at the same time – in other words for introducing what we are calling a ‘Green New Deal’. That meeting should have been the moment for a massive investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, for example, not just because we have to urgently address the challenge of climate change, but because investment in green technologies is one of the best ways of getting people back to work. Green energy, for example, is far more jobs-rich than investment in business as usual, yet the package agreed by the G20 will actually lock the world into a high-carbon economy at exactly the time that we should be shifting to a very different low-carbon sustainable economy. Billions of euros were found for the IMF and the World Bank, but for making that vital transition to a green economy there was no serious money on the table, just vague aspirations – just talks about talks. The communiqué’s words about climate change and the low-carbon economy were relegated to just two paragraphs at the end of the communiqué, with no specific commitments. It is a tragedy that, at the very moment when the economic system and the global environment are on a collision course, this crucial opportunity to change direction and to make sure that we tackle both of those crises and get people back to work was lost.
 Caroline Lucas,  
rapporteur. 
− Mr President, I should like to start by saying how relieved I am that, at long last, we finally have before us a proposal for legislation to tackle the problem of illegal logging. Parliament has been waiting for this for an enormous amount of time and I warmly thank my colleagues for their persistent efforts to see it brought forward. I would also like to thank my colleagues for their outstanding cooperation in bringing us to the point of tomorrow’s vote; shadows and staff have truly pulled out all the stops so that we could complete Parliament’s first reading in the shortest possible time, so as to be in a position to seek a first-reading agreement and thus to avoid any further delays. Sadly, however, the painfully slow rate of progress in the Council has put paid to that idea. So it seems that we will have to be content with concluding this work in the autumn, following political agreement by the Council in June, and that is very disappointing both to myself and to many colleagues who have worked so hard. Had the Council been here I would have liked to have asked them for a guarantee tonight that they will do everything possible to reach a common position before the summer, because this situation is incredibly urgent. Illegal logging is a hugely serious problem, against which the EU has preached for many years, yet all the while continuing to provide one of the world’s biggest markets for illegally logged timber and timber products. Between 20% and 40% of global industrial wood production is estimated to come from illegal sources, and up to 20% of that finds its way into the EU. That depresses timber prices, it strips natural resources and tax revenue, and it increases the poverty of forest-dependent peoples. The longer-term effects are even more serious, as Commissioner Dimas indicated, since deforestation, of which illegal logging is a major driver, accounts for nearly one fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions. With the Copenhagen Climate Conference now on the horizon, credible EU action on illegal logging is ever more important. But credible action means effective, binding legislation. While the voluntary partnership agreements conceived under the 2003 FLEGT Action Plan have the potential to drive positive change, to date only one has been signed and, as long as their coverage is not universal, the risks of money-laundering and circumvention are just too high. The good news is that we do finally have EU legislation; the bad news is that the Commission proposal is distressingly weak and will need comprehensive improvement in order to become meaningful and effective. In spite of Commissioner Dimas’ good words about the importance of tackling illegal logging, the Commission proposal as it stands simply is not up to the job. The preamble to the proposal states that ‘weak rules to prevent trade in illegally harvested timber’ are at the root of the prevalence of illegal logging, but what the Commission has come up with, I am afraid, will do nothing to change that. Quite simply, the Commission proposal as it stands will not achieve our aim of ensuring that the EU no longer provides a market for illegally logged timber. The most glaring, gaping hole in the proposal is that it does not actually prohibit the import and sale of illegally logged timber – perverse as that sounds. It requires only that operators at one particular point in the supply chain put in place a due-diligence system while everyone else is immune from any obligation as to the legality of the timber or the timber products that they trade. Now that stands in stark contrast to the revised US Lacey Act adopted in May 2008, which does enact an explicit prohibition on the import and sale of illegally logged timber, and there is absolutely no good reason why the EU cannot emulate this. So, while my report maintains the Commission’s suggestion that only operators who place timber and timber products on the EU market for the first time should be required to put in place a full due-diligence system – since they are clearly the actors with the most influence – it makes clear that all operators in the market share responsibility for trading only legally sourced wood and that failing to do that may constitute an offence. I should like to say to Commissioner Dimas that I really do believe that our proposals are supplementing due diligence: they are making it more effective, they are making it operational and there is no problem at all with WTO rules. If the US can do it, we should do it, and that is why Parliament is seeking to amend this proposal.
 Caroline Lucas,  
rapporteur. 
− Mr President, I should like to thank my colleagues, and Commissioner Dimas, very much for their comments. One important point I would like to make is that great care has been taken in our amendments not to reinvent the wheel. I have learnt from meetings with numerous industry representatives and other stakeholders that many countries, and also many companies, already have in place excellent systems which would fulfil most, if not all, requirements of the due-diligence system. It makes sense, then, that all the work that has gone into establishing those systems does not go to waste and that we do not create unnecessary extra administrative burdens; that is far from being our intention. That being so, we have been very careful and have made use of good advice on including wording which would enable good existing systems to qualify under the regulation without the need to establish whole new structures. So we have taken very seriously the message that we should not be disproportionate, that we should not be putting too much burden on the different players in the trading system, and that is exactly what our report aims to do: to make sure that all players in the trading system have a responsibility, that we do not put everything onto those who first put the products onto the market. That is what seems disproportionate. I think it is much more sensible that everybody has a role to play. I would also add that many elements of our proposals are actually supported by industry. It is rather ironic that in many senses industry seems to be far more ambitious in this area than even the Commission itself. I have heard directly from industry how much they appreciate not only the fact that the Committee on the Environment’s report provides them with much greater clarity on what will be expected of them, but also precisely this fairer and more effective sharing of responsibility across the different parts of the supply chain which I have just described. As far as European operators are concerned, I would like to say very clearly that the regulation as we have amended it should do nothing but benefit responsible European operators, since the vast majority of them already do most of what is being asked, and the existence of the regulation will prevent them from being undercut by other, less scrupulous, operators. So we should be very clear that there is nothing in this report that makes life difficult for European operators. We have also got some special measures for smaller operators, so we have taken very seriously the risk of being disproportionate; I think we have addressed that very sensibly in the report that we have put before you. Having heard again your comments, Commissioner, on the Environment Committee’s report, I am afraid I do maintain my view that the Commission’s proposal as it stands is disappointing and weak and simply will not do what it claims to do. I fail to see how you can have legislation aimed at preventing the sale of illegally logged timber which does not actually make doing so an offence. The way in which the whole Commission proposal is written is very patchy and it is very timid. I think most European consumers would be genuinely shocked to realise that the EU does not already have in place legislation against illegal logging, and I suspect that all those who concluded, in response to the Commission’s own consultation, that legislation was the only way to really address the problem would not see the particular proposals by the Commission, the due-diligence system on its own, as sufficient to be able to address the problems that we face. I will end my comments tonight by seeking – maybe via your good offices, Commissioner – to put some pressure behind the Council to speed up their work, because we really do want to make sure we get a common position from the Council before the summer so that we can move swiftly on with this in the autumn. As I said earlier, we had really hoped to get a first-reading agreement. Parliament did everything it could to enable that to happen. It is, frankly, deeply disappointing that the Council has not acted with equivalent seriousness and speed, but I hope I can ask you once again, Commissioner, to do all you can to ensure that the Council does move swiftly on this.

 Mr President, I add my thanks to Mr Florenz for his report but I think, amidst all the congratulations to the rapporteur and to the committee for its work, we need to face some cold facts: the EU is still doing too little, too late. I do not expect to be popular for saying so, but we need to be measuring the EU’s progress not against what other countries are doing, but against what needs to be done. Against that measure we are still failing. We are failing in not bringing sufficient ambition to this debate. The latest science tells us we need to be reducing emissions by around 9% year on year. The targets set out in this report and in the EU’s climate package are simply not ambitious enough. We are failing in not bringing enough urgency to this debate. If we are not well on the way to a zero-carbon economy in the next eight to ten years we will have lost the opportunity to have halted the worst of climate change. We are failing in not being consistent. Today, we speak of renewables and energy efficiency. Yesterday, a majority in this House adopted the Laperrouze report which proudly upheld the role of coal in Europe. We are failing in giving the impression that the climate change debate is all about giving things up, about doing without things. We need to get much better at showing real political leadership and demonstrating that action on climate change will bring us a better quality of life. It is not about shivering around a candle in a cave: it is about a future that can be more positive and attractive than today’s. So I commend to you the idea of adopting a green new deal for Europe, a way of addressing both the economic crisis and the climate crisis, with a major investment in energy efficiency and renewables, to create millions of new green jobs in Europe. But that is not about kick-starting economic growth in a ‘business as usual’ direction. It is about an urgently-needed transition not to a Europe based on the ever-increasing consumption of natural resources, but to a steady-state economy for Europe; not more aggregate quantitative growth, but real qualitative development. That debate urgently needs to be begun, and the EU is very well placed to start it.

 Madam President, my thanks to Mrs Doyle for all her hard work. This morning President Sarkozy said that compromise is the spirit of Europe. Well, unfortunately I do not think that sentiment will be much of a consolation in just a few decades from now, when people look back at 2008 and ask themselves what on earth were politicians thinking about. Knowing what they knew then, why on earth did they not do more to save all of us from the unbearable impacts of a warming planet? Why did they not act with more urgency and determination? I think that is a question we should be asking ourselves, because the science is very clear: that 20% emission reductions by 2020 is simply no way near ambitious enough to give us any serious likelihood of avoiding a 2°C temperature increase. And scandalously looking at the package as a whole, well over half of that utterly inadequate emissions reduction could in any case be outsourced to developing countries. That is not only scientifically unsound, it is also ethically wrong. Meanwhile the emissions trading system is itself being turned into a windfall profit machine for Europe’s most polluting industries. Instead of learning from the first phases of the ETS, we appear to be creating laws that would subsidise these industries and delay still further our transition to a more sustainable economy. So I am afraid I cannot share Mr Sarkozy’s celebration of compromise, not when that compromise is made up of countless corporate concessions which put the profits of industry literally before the liveability of this planet. Not when that compromise means that sectors representing fully 96% of the non-power emissions are to be given 100% free allocation of permits. Not when that means the carbon price will be driven so low that there will be nothing like the necessary stimulus for investment in green energy alternatives. This is not a day for celebration: it is a day to reflect on how much more is needed to generate the political will to stand a chance of avoiding the worst of climate chaos. And a day to reflect that yet another opportunity for real change has sadly been lost.
 Caroline Lucas  (Verts/ALE
). - 
 Mr President, I share the anger and frustration of all those who are rightly criticising people in this Parliament and Council who are trying to destroy our commitments to an ambitious climate and energy package. The EU is now calling into question its own 30% commitment, seeking to offset most of what reduction effort it sets itself, whittling away the auctioning demands of the power sector and almost all other industries, putting in place car efficiency standards that are worse than the status quo, and criminally failing to commit funds for solidarity with developing countries. All this means that the EU’s climate package is looking increasingly empty, and Europe’s politicians will not be forgiven for such a monumental failure of political leadership. I want to challenge one sentiment that has been repeated several times today. We do not have to choose between tackling the economic crisis and tackling the climate crisis. We should be using the financial crisis as an opportunity to completely reshape the focus and direction of our economy, to make it a genuinely sustainable economy which will actually deliver environmental and economic benefits. This is a critical test for the whole EU project itself, and it is not one we can afford to fail.

 Madam President, I am very happy that this House has become rather more critical towards the Doha Round in recent years. In fact, the joint resolution in front of us reflects very faithfully the declaration of the Global Parliamentary Assembly in September, which expresses very serious concerns about the very little development content that remains in the Doha negotiations and is very critical of its ever more exclusive deal-making procedures. Let me add that, in the spirit of the declaration of that Global Parliamentary Assembly, I hope that the amendment put forward by the PPE-DE Group and the UEN Group, calling for bilateral WTO-plus type free trade agreements, will not be carried in tomorrow’s vote. Bilateral FTAs are exactly the opposite of a functioning multilateralism and Greens will not be able to support the resolution, if indeed that amendment is carried. What strikes me in our debate today, and indeed in this resolution, is the failure of courage to name a simple truth – that the Doha Round negotiations, as we have got to know them, are now over. That suspension could well be long, lasting until the spring of 2010. It is almost certain that the new negotiators of the US, the Commission, India, will not be going back to the same old quick fixes of July 2008 that did not work even then. So this is actually an opportunity. This is exactly the right time to evaluate the failures of the last seven years of Doha talks and to re-establish a common and fairer agenda, together with a more open and democratic process, which can be fully supported by all WTO members and especially the least developed among them.

 Mr President, let me start by thanking all of my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade and in the Committee on Legal Affairs for their excellent cooperation on my report on the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) 2006. The wide political consensus we found is very reassuring, given the extreme importance of the issue of forests, timber and trade. You may note that almost a year has elapsed between the referral of this agreement to Parliament and this debate this evening. That definitely does not represent any underestimate on the part of the Committee on International Trade as to the importance of this issue; rather it stems from our view that the agreement requires parliamentary assent rather than simple consultation, not least because we have some strong and specific views on the agreement which we believe should be taken into account. The chairman of the Trade Committee, Mr Markov, will explain further the detailed procedural efforts we made to get a greater role for Parliament on this file and he will also, I am sure, outline the very disappointing response we had from the Council in terms of delay and ultimate refusal. I said that Parliament has some strong and specific views on the agreement. Without doubt it does represent an improvement on the older ITTA agreement of 20 years ago which, although it was billed as an agreement promoting both trade and sustainability, is in reality very much about trade and not very much about sustainability. Maybe that explains why one of the key signatories to the agreement, Indonesia, has irrevocably lost about three quarters of its forests and why half of all logging in regions like the Amazon, the Congo Basin, South-East Asia, is still done illegally. So, while the new agreement is an improvement on the former one, and we therefore offer support to the Community’s ratification of it, this should be understood as very much a reluctant endorsement of an unsatisfactory agreement. ITTA 2006 falls well short of what is required to address the problem of the loss of tropical forests. For example, it still defines as its objective the promotion of the expansion of international trade, before moving on to speak in just a few words about sustainability. Again, if you look at the voting structure of the organisation behind the agreement, it gives more votes to producer countries that export more timber, and awards more votes to import-heavy consumer countries. In other words, for all the rhetoric about sustainability, the system is still designed to give greatest influence to those who trade the most. So our report calls on the Commission to begin already to prepare for the next round of ITTA negotiations to secure a greatly improved successor agreement. Parliament’s assent to any future agreement will depend on a radical change in the underlying objectives of the agreement towards the protection and sustainable management of tropical forests, with trade in tropical timber taking place only to the extent that it is consistent with that objective. That means that the Commission should propose appropriate financing mechanisms for countries that are willing to limit their timber exports, as well as proposing a major reorganisation of the ITTA voting system. But we also have another demand to make of the Commission, and that is to do with the long-awaited legislative proposal on further measures to combat illegal logging. We absolutely have to see this without delay. It was under preparation at the start of the year, it was supposed to have been voted on by the Commission in May and has been repeatedly delayed due, we understand, to industry pressure. This is despite numerous expressions of wide political support from Parliament for the proposal. The last information we have is that the proposal is to be voted by the college of Commissioners on 15 October – I would be grateful for any confirmation of that – and I would call very strongly on our Commissioners to take their responsibilities very seriously, because this issue of deforestation is a massively important one; it is one that concerns the whole Parliament. I look forward to a very strong and optimistic response from the Commission today.
 Caroline Lucas,  
rapporteur

 Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues for their comments and support, but I do want to have a few words with Commissioner Barrot in particular. I hope you have heard the impatience and the frustration that has been expressed right across this House tonight about the endless delays to this long-awaited legislative proposal on measures to combat illegal logging. Please take back to your colleagues the fact that this Parliament believes that it is utterly unacceptable that that legislative proposal is constantly delayed. I am very sorry that you have not been able to answer a question that has been put to you at least three times by people here tonight about when we might expect that proposal. I think it plays very badly with the public as well. I think it looks very bad that the EU is unable to get its own house in order. We like to talk about the political leadership that we like to think that we have in the world. If that political leadership means anything, then it should mean that we stop the sale and the import of illegal timber into the EU, and we want to see much more urgent action to achieve that. While I have the floor, I would just like to raise one other issue. Many colleagues have mentioned the link between deforestation and climate change, and I would like to add a final point about the climate package that colleagues will be voting on in the coming weeks. You will know that deforestation is a key issue when it comes to the emissions trading system, and I want to urge colleagues not to be persuaded by arguments in favour of including so-called ‘sink credits’ in the emissions trading system. We held a lunchtime debate about this today in which we underlined why putting deforestation into the emissions trading system is a bad idea for a host of reasons, not least that it would swamp the whole emissions trading system. There are big problems around the verification, monitoring, reporting and liability regimes. We certainly do need to tackle deforestation as part of the climate package, but we are arguing that that should be done by using the auctioning revenues to properly invest in those countries that have that issue. Commissioner, please make autumn the moment when the EU really starts to get credible on forestry. Please assure us that you will bring forward that proposal as soon as possible.

 Mr President, let me start by thanking the rapporteur for his openness and cooperation. However, having said that, our group will not be able to support this report in tomorrow’s vote, partly indeed because of this presumption that trade in services is essentially exactly the same as trade in goods. As Mrs Castex has already said, that simply is not the case. We cannot agree with that, not least because trade in services almost always requires changes in national legislation or in implementing regulations, which often go to the very heart of the social fabric of a society, especially if it concerns basic services on which people depend. It also goes against the evidence that WTO members themselves increasingly distinguish between trade in goods and trade in services. At the last WTO ministerial meeting just a few months ago in July in Geneva, a group of Latin American countries even circulated a proposal to remove health care, education, water, telecommunications and energy entirely from the WTO, exactly on the basis that these are essentially public services and they are human rights which should not be treated as tradable commodities. Finally, the report does quote quite selectively some positive national examples of liberalisation and basic services, but it does not refer at all to the very many devastating examples which could equally well have been cited and which we ought to be mindful of as well. The issue that I want to focus on is the problem of the liberalisation of financial services. No issue has dominated the headlines more this year than the global financial crisis. It is widely agreed to have been facilitated by a lack of adequate regulation in financial markets. Yet, in the WTO negotiations on services, further deregulation and liberalisation of financial markets is being sought by richer countries, and indeed this report entirely supports that proposal. It does seem a bit ironic to me that the WTO Director, Pascal Lamy, has called for a conclusion to the WTO agenda as a solution to the global financial crisis when its actual policies would, by any objective estimation, probably be much more likely to contribute to further financial instability. I am disappointed that all our amendments that would have required at least a pause in further liberalisation of financial services until the financial stability forum has issued its recommendations about some basic new regulations such as capital requirements and cross-border liquidity – this was just a fairly mild request that we should wait for that – have actually been rejected. For that reason we have retabled those amendments and we would certainly ask you to support them.

 Mr President, I am losing count of the number of times we stand up in this Chamber to condemn the Israeli authorities for their systematic abuse of the human rights of the Palestinian people. The occupation, the separation wall, the siege of Gaza – the list goes on. Today we focus on the terrible situation of Palestinian prisoners, including 44 members of the Legislative Council. These are our counterparts, our partners, who still languish in prison without charge and without trial. My question is this: When is the European Council going to act? How many more violations of international law does it take? How many more Palestinians have to be arrested, imprisoned and tortured before the EU stops just talking about human rights and starts taking action to defend them? To consider upgrading EU-Israel relations at a time like this demonstrates the most breathtaking disregard for our responsibility to the Palestinian people. To fail to invoke Article 2 of the Association Agreement demonstrates the most deplorable political cowardice. Our argument is not with the Israeli people, many of whom join us in our condemnation of the Israeli authorities. My argument is right now not even with Israel. It is with the European Council and its grotesque failure of political leadership.

 Madam President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Liese for his excellent work on this file. I am only sorry that despite his best efforts the agreement we have before us today is one that my group can support only very reluctantly. That is a direct result of the deeply disappointing lack of ambition shown by the Council. For years now, governments have been talking with such enthusiasm about the ETS as the great answer to ensuring that aviation makes a real contribution to emissions reductions. Trading does indeed have the potential to play a useful role, but everything depends on the design of the scheme. Because of the Council’s intransigence the agreement we have today is a far cry from what is really needed and represents starkly the enormous gap between our governments’ rhetoric on climate change and the degree of political will that they are actually willing to muster. This agreement lacks crucial aspects, like a gateway to limit the degree to which aviation can just carry on business as usual by buying up emission permits from other sectors. It lacks full auctioning of emission permits despite the fact that it fulfils the Commission’s criterion of being able to fully pass on the costs, and it lacks a cap which is anywhere near as demanding as that required of other sectors. Now Parliament has done its best, and the agreement before us does at least represent some improvements on the common position. It is a small step in the right direction, but it is also a truly missed opportunity for what could have been. In order for it to become meaningful and for aviation emissions to be genuinely addressed we must now make sure the efforts are rapidly scaled up and given the environmental integrity they urgently need.
 Caroline Lucas  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, at first sight this report may seem like a technical one, simply summarising the science as we know it. But make no mistake, this report is also a deeply political one and it is a call to arms, because the fact is that this report demonstrates the urgent need for a complete revolution in the way we run our economies. Knowledge brings with it responsibility and to know what we know about the realities of climate change and yet to fail to act in a commensurate way would amount to nothing less than a crime against future generations. So the logic of the report is this: that the EU’s 20% emission reduction target is quite simply incompatible with the science on two degrees; that we must therefore move unilaterally to make at least 30% domestic reductions now; that we must respond to new facts – just last month a leading climate scientist, James Hansen, warned that current targets are far too weak and that we must commit far more resources to helping developing countries adapt, with all the revenue from the ETS auctioning being ring-fenced for climate action. The good news is that the EU is uniquely well placed to take the lead on climate change and that, if we were to take up that challenge, we might also find that our own institutions are revitalised and that the EU is reconnected with the citizens it is supposed to represent.
 Caroline Lucas  (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I welcome Ms Ferreira’s excellent work and cooperation, thanks to which we have before us a report that gives a comprehensive and honest appraisal of the potential and limitations of market-based instruments. Market instruments clearly have a role to play. Making economic logic align with environmental and social reality by applying the ‘polluter pays’ principle should be a powerful way of steering patterns of production and consumption towards sustainability. For example, if the true environmental and social costs of freight transport were internalised within prices paid along the supply chain, we might finally see an end to the madness that sees more or less identical products being pointlessly traded back and forth between distant countries. Applying such principles at the level of individuals via a system of personal carbon trading could be an extremely effective way of influencing consumer behaviour. But, as Ms Ferreira’s report rightly makes clear, market instruments must not be seen as a replacement for other forms of environmental standards and regulation. Their usefulness also depends crucially on the way in which they are designed. The emissions trading system is a case in point. I would like to warn colleagues that, if we listen to a lot of what the industry is telling us, we will end up with a scheme that is no more than trading backwards and forwards for the sake of trading, as we have seen with the first two phases, completely losing sight of any environmental objectives. To be effective, the scheme has to have a tough cap deriving from the 30% emissions reduction target, restrictions on the entry of outside credits and full auctioning of allowances from the outset. Finally, I would like to mention one other welcome thread running through the report – the recognition that traditional economic growth as measured by GDP is no longer an adequate or accurate measure of true well-being. A conference was held on this topic in Parliament earlier this year and I look forward to the Commission’s report in the autumn.

 Madam President, the Green Group certainly supports the general lines taken in this report, especially the call for more consistency between WTO rule-setting, the work of UN agencies and the existing social, environmental and human rights covenants. We believe that it must include an observer status for the ILO, as well as measures against social and ecological dumping. We also support the role of parliamentary scrutiny in order to mitigate the WTO’s lack of accountability and legitimacy, as well as the need to develop the WTO dispute settlement on the basis of international environmental and social law, ensuring that it has real sanctioning capacities. I am concerned, though, that the report fails to acknowledge that the failure of the Doha Round is precisely rooted in the shortcomings of the WTO as an organisation. These are not two separate things. The stalling of the Doha Round is completely linked to the systematic abuses of its decision-making processes by some powerful countries and the resulting alienation of the weaker countries. I think the report also fails to recognise that it required nothing less than a revolution on the part of developing countries in Cancún in 2003 and of some of the emerging countries prior to Hong Kong in order to begin to end the old feudal system on which the WTO has been running for far too long. I think it is clear that we should stop waiting until we have an outcome from the Doha Round and immediately start with the reform of the WTO: reform both of its procedures and also of its policies, because reform of process alone is not enough. We need to look at a whole range of rules that are now completely out of date in the 21st century, facing new challenges like climate change. So we need to look at rules like the one on PPMs, for example: the prohibition of distinguishing between products on the basis of which they have been produced. Such discrimination is crucial if we are able to support and promote things like energy efficiency, for example, and fewer emissions. We also want to see a complete refocusing of the dispute settlement proceedings, and I would commend to my colleagues an amendment that the Greens have put down which asks very specifically for a new way of looking at the dispute settlements mechanism, ensuring that it is rooted in the principles of the UN Charter and that it is separated out of the current WTO form.

 Madam President, my group strongly supports calling on the Commission to supply Parliament with more information about these FTA negotiations and in particular to transmit the actual negotiating mandate and an updated sustainability impact assessment. We also support the emphasis on the need for a strong chapter within the FTA on sustainable development, given the poor record of the Gulf States with regard to social and environmental standards. That is what makes us concerned about suggestions from the Trade DG that since the FTA negotiations with the Gulf States started a long time ago, when sustainable development issues were apparently less relevant, it is somehow now too late to burden the negotiations with new issues like human rights clauses. I think we need to say that this is politically unacceptable and we hope that the Trade DG will keep in mind that Parliament will need to give its assent to any final results of the negotiations. But beyond our concern about the social and environmental standards of trade within the Gulf region, we need to ask more carefully what kind of trade an FTA with the Gulf aims to liberalise. We know of course that the EU interest is about unlimited access to energy resources, about doing away with any barriers to trade like export taxes or quantitative restrictions. Of course we know the EU is trying to out-compete other industrialised and emerging economies to get the best access conditions, that the EU sees rising energy prices and wants to sell more to the region in order to redress its trade balance. Of course, this is completely inconsistent with the EU’s stated goals with regard to its policy on climate change. But let us just imagine a different scenario: that the EU would not seek to balance its trade relations through all-out liberalisation but would use the incentive of trade imbalance to foster the development and application of renewable energy; that the EU would not participate in the international race to secure access to oil but would insist on multilateral agreements giving all countries a fair share of diminishing global resources. In comparison to this kind of ambitious scenario that we would like to see, the insistence of Parliament on a strong chapter in the FTA on sustainable development is absolutely the minimum we need in terms of deciding whether or not this House can give its assent to the upcoming agreement.

 Madam President, I would like to start by strongly challenging the assumption that seems to lie behind this oral question. Trying to link the rise in animal feed prices in Europe and the corresponding crisis in the livestock industry to the EU’s GM laws in general, and its zero-tolerance policy in particular, is completely false and disingenuous. It is certainly true that times are hard for livestock farmers, but I make the case that this has nothing to do with Europe’s GM policies and everything to do with a combination of factors, including poor weather conditions leading to reduced harvests, deregulation of markets, increased demand by countries like China, the rapid and misguided increase in biofuel production and growing financial speculation. Much is also being made by the GM industry of DG Agriculture’s report on the potential impact of the EU’s GM regime on the availability and price of animal feed. The worst-case scenario in the report rests on the assumption that Brazil will rapidly commercialise a GM soya bean variety not approved in the EU. But absolutely no evidence is presented that Brazil is even considering new GM soya beans. The report finds that US approvals will be unaffected by EU policy and that Brazil and Argentina will, in fact, be much more cautious about approving new GM crops that could otherwise damage their exports to the EU. For example, Argentina has introduced a certification scheme for maize exports to the EU, precisely to avoid unapproved traits. Moreover, there is no evidence either of major distortion of competition caused by imports of meat from animals that may have been fed with GMOs not authorised in the EU. So, frankly, all of these questions are ill-informed and tendentious. But I do have some questions of my own with regard to any proposed threshold for EU non-approved GMOs. First, how can the Commission be sure that EU non-approved GMOs are safe? Second, in the case of damage, which institution or company will have to pay? The EU, which allows such contamination? The company, which has developed the GMO but has so far no valid market approval? Or the company responsible for the import? Finally, should such a threshold also apply to genetically engineered plants that produce substances like pharmaceuticals? What assessment has been carried out on the contamination of daily food with active pharmaceutical substances? I look forward to hearing full answers to these crucial questions at the end of this debate.

 Mr President, this coming weekend the second phase of the largest commercial seal hunt in the world is about to begin off the coast of Atlantic Canada. The Canadian Government has given its assurance that this hunt will be conducted humanely and, as a condition of their licences, sealers are now required to stun seals and check they are unconscious and then bleed them out before they are skinned. Yet, according to independent observers, there is little evidence of this happening. That is, of course, when they have actually been permitted to observe sealing activities. The Department of Fisheries’ systematic attempts to block the observation of this year’s hunt have been almost as alarming as the blatant violations of the sealing regulations that have thus far been recorded. If the Canadian authorities are so very confident that these regulations are being adhered to, then why are they doing their utmost to prevent animal welfare specialists and journalists from witnessing it? Moreover, we should not forget that no such animal welfare guarantees have ever been made for the commercial seal hunts elsewhere in the world, such as Russia and Namibia. With the current legislature coming to an end, it is vital that the Commission take swift action, in response to Written Declaration 38, by publishing a proposal to ban the import and export of and trade in seal products. Such a ban would not affect subsistence farming, but it would demonstrate a commitment to protect animal welfare.

 Madam President, I would also like to thank Ms Gomes for her excellent report. I should like to start by underlining that any reflection on the EU’s involvement in Iraq must learn from the mistakes of the past, considering that the invasion has been such an enormous political and humanitarian catastrophe. Our starting point should be recognition that Iraq’s problems can only be resolved by giving real and comprehensive sovereignty, including over oil and other resources, back to the Iraqis and I would therefore call for the withdrawal of all foreign occupation troops. I followed the opinion on the report in the Committee on International Trade and from that perspective I observed that the military occupation of Iraq was followed by an economic one, whereby the US privatised public property, liberalised trade and established rules regarding foreign direct investments in clear conflict with international law. That is why we need to be a bit cautious in the areas of trade and investment. The report before us welcomes Iraq’s observer status at the WTO as a key step towards driving Iraq’s integration in the international economy and it looks forward to the EU-Iraq trade and cooperation agreement. I just want to make sure that Iraq has sufficiently built up its own capacities for negotiation and evaluation. Otherwise we risk that country becoming once again prey to outside interests. Similarly, the report calls for help and encouragement for European firms to bid for contracts to rebuild Iraq. Again, let us be sure that we do all we can to build up the capacity of Iraqi companies, as well as the negotiating capacities of the Government, so that we can move forward in a more positive way for everyone.

I voted against this report in order to register my objection to the arrogance and disregard shown by political leaders throughout the EU towards the wishes of EU citizens, and to state very clearly that I believe the people of the EU should be given a referendum on this issue. The Treaty of Lisbon is essentially a repackaging of the old Constitution, which was rejected by France and the Netherlands – two countries where referenda had been allowed. As a key architect of the original text, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, himself has said that ‘The proposals in the original Constitutional Treaty are practically unchanged. They have simply been dispersed through the old Treaties in the form of amendments.’ I do not oppose the principle of a constitution. But I oppose this particular one (and the Treaty which reproduces it) because EU citizens deserve better. While the Treaty includes some positive measures, these are outweighed by negative ones – the further militarisation of the EU, for example, as well as measures to promote greater liberalisation and privatisation. Worse, it squanders a perfect opportunity to put sustainability and climate security genuinely at the heart of the Union, and fails to bring the EU institutions closer to European citizens.

 Mr President, I should like to emphasise that the Greens are very aware that the consequences of a totally liberalised textile and apparel market for EU-based producers is still a very pressing issue, particularly for certain production zones within the EU in which the industry is highly concentrated. Several hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost since the beginning of 2005, albeit fewer than some of the worst predictions. The Greens have from the start flagged our concern about the impact of competition on European producers. I think we need to monitor the situation carefully and be ready to apply import restrictions if import surges in the next year overwhelm the capacity of EU-based apparel industries to adapt, as well, of course, as channelling research and development resources to that sector. However, we need to be aware that the problem is very much harder for certain poor countries in the South, like Bangladesh and the Philippines, which have been induced by the World Bank and other donors to invest heavily in exporting clothing and apparel products and now find themselves with shrinking export opportunities, a continuous debt burden, no financial means for adjustment of the sector, and misery – especially for millions of women who work for almost nothing in nightshifts in order to undercut the cheapest offer on the market with an even cheaper one. It is, in fact, that latter perspective that emphasises that in certain sectors, where too many producers produce too many products, some kind of management tools to control supply are necessary and in the interests of the majority. That is why I urge colleagues to support the amendment that the Greens and Socialists have filed together, which reads: ‘Calls on the Commission to evaluate the usefulness of supply-side management tools for the clothing sector, in order to level off global competition and prevent a lowest-common-denominator approach to social and environmental standards.’ A completely liberalised market in sectors characterised by overproduction capacities brings misery to all but a few. In that respect I think we should use the example of the apparel industry to press for new thinking about the way in which policy ought to regulate markets for the benefit of all. The reintroduction of some kind of quotas should be considered in this evaluation of supply-side management tools. Another option mentioned in the joint resolution which deserves a more comprehensive evaluation is the creation of a Euromed production zone of the clothing and apparel industry. Indeed, that option not only points towards the improvement of opportunities for development in the southern Mediterranean rim states, but also gives opportunities to the southern European textile and apparel producers who would profit from shorter transportation times to EU markets. It is one of the good examples of how a Euromed economic zone could be sensitively managed without dragging the whole of the Mediterranean region in all-out liberalisation through a free trade agreement. From my Group’s perspective, we regard this proposal as an option in its own right that should be fostered independently of the contested 2010 Euromed free-trade-agreement project, which, according to the sustainability impact assessments done by DG Trade in the Commission, would involve a significant number of quite negative social and environmental consequences.

 Mr President, let me start by thanking Mr David Martin for his report and by underlining the crucial importance of this dossier. The EU-Korea Treaty will be the first application of the new EU trade doctrine Global Europe, a doctrine that is highly controversial, not least because it seeks such deep market access conditions through the removal of all kinds of barriers to all-out import penetration, precisely at a time when more and more people are becoming aware that there are very many losers as well as some winners in a completely liberalised global economy. On the positive side, the report sets out some very good standards for trade and social and environmental fields, which Greens absolutely support, and in that respect I think the report sets a very important precedent for further upcoming parliamentary responses to other free trade agreements, with India and ASEAN, for example. So we welcome the fact that the report insists that there must be no exceptions to the rule that access to the European market is conditional on compliance with environmental protection standards. We welcome the fact that it demands that the trade agreement with Korea incorporates binding social and environmental clauses and, to our mind, this by itself makes it difficult to contemplate that the North Korean Kaesong industrial complex would be included within the FTA rules. Most importantly, it intends to give teeth to those binding clauses by demanding that they are subject to the standard dispute settlement mechanism. But we do have some serious misgivings about this report as well. First, there is the demand to scrap all non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade without any attempt at differentiating what really constitutes a legitimate NTB and what does not. We should not assume that everything that prevents unfettered free trade is an illegitimate obstacle. There are some very good reasons to qualify trade, especially when public policy wants to put in place controls for social, health or environmental reasons. We are also opposed to the full introduction of the so-called ‘Singapore issues’ into the free trade agreement. Again there are good reasons why total investment freedom or public procurement should remain outside the scope of a trade agreement. Korea had a devastating experience with the free flow of capital in the late 1990s and they have used sheltered public procurement policies to get back on their feet since then. Now, it is not up to us to judge whether they should offer those items on their side, but we are allowed to judge for our side, and my Group does not support giving unlimited freedom to foreign investors in Europe or destroying the possibility of engaging in public spending for social goals through specific domestic procurement policies.

 Madam President, one of the most effective strategies the EU can employ in Bali is to lead by example. The first piece of new European climate legislation to be decided upon since the March Council is the inclusion of aviation in the Emissions Trading System. So the outcome of that is vitally important, not only in itself but for the signal that it sends to others at the Bali Conference about whether the EU is genuinely serious about its climate change commitments. So far, frankly, the outlook is pretty grim. The Commission’s initial proposal was hopelessly weak and the fact that the Council has been unable to reach a common mandate for a first reading agreement sends extremely negative messages. I therefore urge both the Council and the Commission to raise their game substantially and quickly. Success in Bali also depends critically on whether equity is at the heart of any new agreement. That is why proposals must be based on convergence towards equal per capita emission rights, such as the approach known as ‘contraction and convergence’. I urge the Council and Commission to follow that approach. Finally, I would caution against an over-reliance on carbon-offsetting mechanisms. As a colleague of mine memorably pointed out, carbon offsets are about as useful as an anti-smoking campaign that pays someone else to stop smoking in the developing world while you continue cheerfully puffing away. It is irresponsible and critically ineffective.

 Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Zaleski very warmly on his report. I think it is a significantly different kind of report to recent ones which have been voted on in the Committee on International Trade. Compared to the reports on bilateral trade relations of one or two years ago, like the EU-Russia or EU-Mercosur reports, it shows a lot more cautiousness with regard to the benefits of unfettered free trade. And I think it indicates a growing consensus across the party spectrum on the importance of actively engaging in a political search for how best to submit trade rules to the principles of sustainable development. In that respect, I think we can be pleased that we have made the most of the various delays at the WTO Doha Round, which, in a way, have allowed us to conduct this search for more fair and sustainable trade rules in our bilateral trade relations. I therefore thank the rapporteur for actively seizing this opportunity. Among the many positive signals that this report gives to DG Trade for their negotiations with Ukraine on a free trade agreement, I would like to highlight four points in particular. In paragraph 10, I think the report rightly warns against relying exclusively on export orientation and export diversification in order to make trade sustainable. Instead, it focuses on the importance of developing the domestic market as a necessary basis for any economically sustainable development. In paragraph 13, the report suggests the need to strike a balance with regard to investors’ rights. In other words, it insists on a legal framework in Ukraine which fosters best practice in corporate social responsibility. In paragraph 23, the report suggests a significant shift in our foreign energy supply policy by asking for multilateral rules regarding access to energy resources and by warning not to support the race for the best conditions for unilateral energy access. Finally, in paragraph 36 the report recognises that agriculture is a special activity that cannot be treated in the same way as industrial goods and therefore justifies different tariff rules. I very much hope that those and other points remain in the final text so that my group can very happily vote in favour of the report. But I do just want to add that I think it is a pity to hear that DG Trade has been objecting to three key amendments proposed by the Greens and supported by the rapporteur, which call on DG Trade to start negotiations for a bilateral FTA only after the Parliament of Ukraine has given its assent to the WTO accession negotiations. While DG Trade is certainly right that this might delay the bilateral FTA, we have to insist as parliamentarians, as we do ourselves before the conclusion of such FTAs on the part of the European Union, for the voice of the people to be taken into account on such an important matter and that includes, of course, the people of Ukraine. We would therefore especially like to thank Mr Zaleski for not giving in to that pressure and, once again, for an excellent report.

 Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Liese for his excellent cooperation and congratulate him on his work. However, I have to say that I appreciated his work a lot more before he had to seek compromises within his political group, which, if adopted, would substantially weaken the position taken by an overwhelming majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety just last month. That matters, because we have to substantially strengthen the Commission’s original proposal if we are to have any real chance of seriously reducing the impact of aviation on our climate. According to the Commission’s own figures, all its proposals are currently going to achieve is that, by 2020, instead of aviation emissions growing by 83% under a do-nothing scenario, they would grow instead by 78%. That reduction is the equivalent of less than one year’s growth in air travel. That is not serious, it is not ambitious, it is not global leadership. To achieve emission reductions via trading relies crucially on scarcity of permits. Since aviation emissions have already doubled since 1990, to call for an initial allocation equivalent to average emissions over the period 2004-2006, or even 80-90% of that, is simply too generous. I therefore urge you to support my Group’s amendments for an initial allocation that is 50% of that amount. We also need 100% auctioning so that there are no windfall profits at the expense of the passenger. Finally, I urge you to vote against the ALDE Group’s frankly scandalous amendment, which seeks to remove the restrictions on access to clean development mechanism and joint implementation project credits, not just for aviation but for all sectors in the ETS. Removing such limits provides an open invitation to business as usual. Aviation and the other industries will be able to continue to increase their emissions without constraint by merely buying up the supposed reductions made elsewhere, and, considering recent reports that up to half of reductions from CDM and JI projects are questionable, this will fundamentally undermine the integrity of the entire scheme. Tomorrow the European Parliament faces a serious test of whether it really wants to take real action on climate change, and, if it is going to show genuine leadership, then it needs to support the Green amendments.

 Mr President, I feel very disappointed that Parliament has not done more today on this pesticides package. On so many of the more radical and progressive issues, we could have gone very much further. But the one area that I want to focus on just now is the area of residents. They should be regarded as a specifically vulnerable group, an exposure group in their own right, and a small step has been taken today in order to do that, in the vote that we have just had in this Parliament. People who live near schools where nearby fields are sprayed and people who work or live near sprayed fields have an enormously high exposure to pesticides. They are exposed, on a long-term basis, to mixtures or cocktails of pesticides that are sprayed in their locality throughout the year and, in many cases, for decades. Until now there has not been any protection for residents as a specific exposure group. This is a major and serious public health issue, as farmers clearly cannot control pesticides once they are airborne, and studies have shown pesticides can travel in the air for miles. I wish we had gone further in terms of our ban on all aerial spraying. There have been many reports over the decades of acute and chronic ill-health in rural areas. Our Parliament could have done much more in this vote today to protect people from cancers, from leukaemia, from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and a whole range of other diseases, and I am very disappointed indeed that we did not take up that option, which had been put forward in the Committee on the Environment. So many of those more positive measures have, sadly, been overturned by the other groups. But I hope that people will look at the Parliament today and put pressure on their representatives so that, when we come back to a second reading, we can try and do better by the health of people. They expect us to do better. We should have done better, and I am very sorry the other groups did not support us today.

 Madam President, I should like to really warmly welcome Mrs Svensson’s report and to congratulate her on her excellent work. She has been a brilliant rapporteur and we have got a very positive result. It is very clear that Parliament is united in saying that there should be no derogations that would compromise the integrity and the effectiveness of a ban. However, I must say that, in terms of this legislation being forthcoming from the Commission, we have had to wait quite a long time. I remember writing to Commissioner Byrne back in 2002 calling for a ban on cat and dog fur. We were told simply that it was a very complex issue and the Commission was reflecting. What worries me about that is that in a sense this slowness is being repeated on another issue that I want to turn your minds to, which is the issue of banning imports of seal products. Again, Parliament is being told that it is a complex issue. Exactly the same language is being used again now, when it comes to seal products, as was used back in 2002 about cat and dog fur. As the draftsperson in the Committee on International Trade, I tabled amendments to the cat and dog proposal, not suggesting that we try to include seals – that would be too much – but at least asking the Commission to bring forward similar legislation to deal with imports of seal products. This was agreed by the Committee on International Trade. The Commissioner said earlier that there was no lack of political will when it came to dealing with the cat and dog issue, what was lacking was an imaginative legal base. I urge the Commissioner and his services to be extraordinarily imaginative and to recognise that Europe’s citizens feel the same revulsion about cat and dog fur as they feel about imports of seal products. We must have legislation coming forward very urgently on that issue as well.

 Madam President, I have to say I am still in a bit of a state of shock over the words of the representative of the Council. I do not understand how he can say that the new unity government does not fulfil the criteria of the Quartet. Our delegation has just come back from the region and all of us unanimously agreed that they had. Yes, there are still some Qassam rockets which of course are to be condemned. But do you really think that, by refusing to fully engage with the government, the EU is helping bring that back under control? Do you really think it has got nothing to do with the economic and political stranglehold in which Israel holds Gaza? You mention the detention of soldier Shalit – and of course he should be released – but you did not even mention the 41 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council who are still detained by Israel; you did not even mention the detention of 10 000 Palestinian political prisoners held by Israel, many without trial. So, let us have some balance in this debate. By refusing to fully recognise the new unity government and by channelling aid via a temporary international mechanism rather than through the Palestinian Authority, the EU is actively undermining the authority and the apparatus of Palestine’s democratic institutions. And, even worse than that, our position is actually encouraging those elements both inside and outside Palestine which want this government to fail. Every day that goes by when we refuse to engage fully with this government is another day for the extremists to say, ‘Look: democracy is not working. We did everything the international community demanded – democratic elections, a new unity government, fulfilling the Quartet demands, and still we face a political and economic boycott. So, why on earth are we helping to bring about a democratically-elected government which is doing its best to keep the peace?’ Is that really what we want? Do not imagine that the alternative will be a slightly different government whose colours we like slightly better. The alternative will be chaos and violence on an unimaginable scale, the whole region will become destabilised and there will be even more rapid growth of extremism across the Middle East. Because, while the Council adopts a wait-and-see policy to review how the new government performs, each day it waits it puts the very outcome it wants to see in ever greater jeopardy. There is a very real danger that in a few years’ time we will look back at this moment and think, ‘Why on earth did we not support democracy in Palestine when we had the chance?’ So to the Council I say please tell us again what the Palestinian Government has to do, and to the Commission I ask, when will you suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement?
 Caroline Lucas,

. – Mr President, I, too, must beg forgiveness of Mr Rocard by focusing on one issue – Palestine. I also believe that, until the EU changes its current position and recognises the National Unity Government in Palestine, we are precisely undermining the opportunities for good relations with the Arab world, we are exacerbating poverty and suffering in the Occupied Territories, we are in danger of destroying the Palestinian Authority itself and we are certainly already destroying the hopes of the Palestinian people. We are also being entirely inconsistent and hypocritical, because the Palestinians I have met have rightly challenged me: Does the EU not say that democracy is better than violence? Well, yes, we do. Did the EU election observers not pronounce the Palestinian elections free and fair? Well, yes, they did. In spite of that, when asked to do so, did the legitimately elected Hamas Government not transform itself into a genuine government of national unity? Yes, it did. Has that government not agreed to the three demands of the quartet to renounce violence, to respect previous agreements and to recognise the State of Israel? Yes, it has. They ask me and I, in turn, ask the Council here tonight, what else is the EU waiting for? I have just come back from a parliamentary delegation visit to Palestine where we met Prime Minister Haniyeh and many of his ministers, and the message from all of them was the same: they have met the demands of the Quartet, they accept a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders and they are ready and eager for peace negotiations. They cannot understand why the EU does not respond and why we insist, for example, on channelling aid via the Temporary International Mechanism, which, while it helps some of the poorest, is unable to prevent the growing humanitarian and political crisis: it undermines the apparatus and the authority of the Palestinian State and, crucially, it strips the EU of the leverage we could – and should – have with the Israeli authorities to pressure them into releasing the Palestinian tax revenues which they are still illegally withholding. We met Mustafa Barghouti, the Minister of Information, and he left us in doubt when he said, ‘If the EU wants the Palestinian Authority to collapse, then it should say so’. Let us be very clear: that is where our policies are leading. I am sure that neither we nor the Council wants the Palestinian Authority to collapse, and so I ask the Council once again: what else is it waiting for?

 Commissioner, you said that proliferation is potentially the greatest threat to our security, and I agree with you. How ironic is it, then, that tomorrow the UK Government is likely to take a decision to replace the Trident nuclear submarine system that will precisely accelerate that proliferation and thus undermine our collective security? When it does so, it will be demonstrating the most breathtaking hypocrisy: maintaining and further developing the UK’s own nuclear weapons, whilst waging illegal wars to try to stop others from obtaining them. What moral authority can the UK Government possibly think it has to lecture countries like Iran about not developing nuclear weapons, when we ourselves continue to do exactly that? The NPT is made up of two pledges: non-nuclear states agree not to acquire nuclear weapons, provided that nuclear states begin a serious process of getting rid of theirs. If we do not keep our side of that bargain, if we do not abide by international law, we can hardly be surprised if others do not keep their side of the bargain either. The UK Government’s upgrading of Trident fundamentally undermines the EU’s collective position on non-proliferation and, therefore, both the UK and, indeed, France, should be strongly condemned by both the Council and the Commission.

 Madam President, congratulations! It is very good to see you in the Chair. Commissioner McCreevy, I too should like to start off by talking about how best we support small and medium-sized enterprises. I am very pleased that there seems to be a concern right across the different political groups of this House. I think we all share that. I would like to ask first of all for some clarification of remarks made by the French Trade Minister, Christine Lagarde, when she came to Parliament’s Committee on International Trade just last week. She spoke very passionately and rightly, I believe, about the importance of defending small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe. And yet you, Commissioner, seem to have a very different view of the role of SMEs and how best to support them. Guaranteeing better access to public procurement contracts for innovative small and medium-sized enterprises is essential. They represent 75 million jobs in the Union and 50% of Community GNI, and they are a vital component of thriving local and regional economies all around the EU. But it seems that the Commission is voluntarily giving up the right to support its SMEs. There are already five countries– Canada, the US, Israel, Japan and South Korea – that will introduce provisions into their legislation which give privileged access to SMEs for public procurement, and yet the EU, bizarrely, has decided it has no interest in standing up for its own SMEs. So Commissioner, can you really justify this position? For the EU to forego the right to a level playing field which would allow SMEs to have an equal opportunity to compete like the large multinationals seems both extraordinary and indeed unacceptable. Surely we too should be using the renegotiation of the GPA in Geneva to break down the WTO barriers which prevent Member States from implementing a privileged access measure for SMEs should they so wish. We too should be arguing for derogations as part of the revised GPA to allow us to bring in preferential measures, and by doing this we are simply restoring equality of treatment in order to prevent the large multinational corporations from having all of the advantages. I very much regret as well that we have not had the opportunity for a prior debate really in Europe about whether it is appropriate to try to extend international trade rules to cover government procurement at all. Many would argue that government procurement has little or nothing to do with traditional matters of trade, tariffs and quotas, and that it is an unacceptable area for negotiations at the WTO, because subjecting government procurement at the national, local or regional level to one-size-fits-all rules at a global level on how taxpayers’ funds are spent I think destroys citizens’ reasonable expectations that they should have a level of democratic accountability over how their money is spent. Essentially, taxpayers’ money is different from private, corporate money, and citizens rightly expect that they should have the right, for example, to lobby to cut off expenditure on companies that were doing business in South Africa when there was apartheid, or to disqualify companies with bad labour or environmental records. I believe we have a really important role to play in defending local sourcing and procurement as a vital instrument of local employment and industrial policy.

 Mr President, there has been a lot of rhetoric here this afternoon, particularly from the Council, but what is missing is a sense of urgency and a commitment to ambitious action. It is clear the EU has to do a lot more and to show real leadership. However, in my one minute I want to ask you, Commissioner Dimas, to do something very specific. There has been a lot of discussion about what is wrong today but not enough about what we need to be doing – some of the answers. I want to raise the issue of personal carbon allowances. It is a scheme that is growing in interest in many Member States whereby emission rights are allocated to all individuals on an equal per capita basis and then surrendered, for example when they are purchasing fossil fuels or electricity for personal use and, of course, over time those emission rights decline. It is complementary to the emissions trading scheme, but in many ways it is more equitable than much greater taxation, it has the advantage of being subject to an overall and declining cap and, crucially, it engages people on a personal level. It affects individual choices that they make, because one of the strongest disincentives to individual action is the sense that your neighbour is not doing what you are doing. Therefore, I would ask your departments to investigate what they can do to encourage the take-up of such schemes across the European Union.

 Mr President, I rise to draw attention to the continuing plight of the West Papuan people. Just a week or so ago was West Papua Independence Day, which is traditionally held on 1 December to mark the anniversary of the Dutch promise to grant independence to West Papua, a promise originally made in December 1961. Of course, that independence never came and instead there has been a continuing military occupation by Indonesia for over 40 years, with torture, disappearance, detention without trial and murder of West Papuans at the hands of the military being commonplace. I am calling on you, President, as well as the Commission and Council, to raise the issue of West Papua’s self-determination with the relevant Indonesian authorities, and for them to do all they can to ensure the withdrawal of the Indonesian military from West Papua and the holding of a free and democratic referendum on self-determination, including all the indigenous West Papuans. A number of colleagues have put down a written declaration for this session to coincide with Independence Day for West Papua, and I urge my colleagues here to co-sign that written declaration.

 Mr President, Christmas has come early for the German chemicals industry because, by supporting this incredibly watered-down compromise, Parliament will be giving the industry an early and unexpectedly large Christmas present, rewarding them for the relentless lobbying which has successfully torn the guts out of this proposal. Thanks to that lobbying and to compliant politicians, both from the Council and among members of the PPE-DE Group in particular, dangerous substances will remain on the market for many years to come, even when safer alternatives already exist. I think that is going to be hard to explain to European citizens. It is a scandal that they will have waited 20 years in total for rules that will continue to allow hazardous chemicals to be used in everyday products, even when substitutes are readily available. It is also completely unnecessary: the second reading in the Environment Committee gave the rapporteur a clear mandate to push for mandatory substitution for all chemical substances of high concern when safer alternatives exist. And yet that was given away, negotiated out of existence. Not only that, but the whole legislation will be shrouded in secrecy. It is completely unacceptable for key personnel in the agency that will implement this legislation to be able to keep their names and their declarations of interest confidential. That is outrageous, and it is extraordinarily ironic, too, that it comes at precisely the time when we are supposed to be convincing European citizens that the EU is open, transparent and accountable. How can we possibly be claiming that, and yet agree to confidentiality here? In the view of my group, Parliament should have rejected the compromise deal and continued to press for a deal via a full second reading and conciliation. There is nothing in this package that we could not have achieved through conciliation, and much that we could have won. Instead, we have had a process that is untransparent, undemocratic and very easily manipulated. My group has put forward two alternative compromise packages. That is not unrealistic, as some have said. In fact, what we are proposing is weaker than what Parliament adopted in first reading, but it is still stronger than the pale and weak compromise on the table now. It is based precisely on the bottom lines that a majority in Parliament have supported all through this process until the very last moment, but then chose to give up as a concession to the rest of the PPE. So, when you, Mr Sacconi, ask us what other mountain we want to climb, the answer is: the one that has been on all of our maps from the very beginning of this process, the one that you told us we were
 climbing, which you were leading us up so well and so masterfully, until at the very last minute you lost your step, you lost your footing, you took a wrong turn and now we are all put in peril. One final point on animal welfare. During the first reading in the Environment Committee, I tabled a completely non-animal test strategy, which was adopted. It did not survive the subsequent plenary vote, but it did send a very strong signal that we want much greater emphasis on non-animal alternatives. The promotion of non-animal tests is now one of the objectives of the REACH regulation, and that is hugely important. It must not just be a gesture; it must be turned into a legal commitment to replace animal tests much faster than we have been doing. Animal tests are not only cruel, they are inefficient, they are outdated and they are frequently misleading. Replacing them as fast as possible is not just an issue of animal rights: it is an issue of human health and of human rights as well.

 Mr President, in order to be credible and genuinely effective, we have to demonstrate that the GSP+ scheme is working properly. In other words, the EU must act swiftly and decisively when there are infringements of the social or environmental standards in question. This is not merely a theoretical or academic discussion, but a very real discussion about real countries. The case of El Salvador has already been raised. In fact, El Salvadorian workers have for years seen incredible resistance by their own Government, company owners and the right-wing media to try to avoid, or at least delay, the implementation of core labour conventions, and it is very unfortunate that an EU Member State, Spain, has seemingly supported them in that attempt. However, the fact that the El Salvadorian Government has recently ratified four key ILO conventions is not the real victory it might seem, because by reforming its civil service laws the Government has actually succeeded in removing large numbers of workers from any possible benefits of those ILO conventions. That is totally unacceptable, and I therefore formally ask the Commission to initiate without delay an investigation into the situation in El Salvador and to consider a temporary withdrawal of GSP preferences. I would be happy to furnish the Commissioner with further details from the trade union groups and civil societies in El Salvador. Colombia is another case of blatant violation of workers’ rights, despite the window dressing of official enshrinement of ILO conventions. The monthly and often weekly reports of trade union members ‘disappearing’ and being killed tell the true story of the blood toll paid by those who dare to assume that ILO rights officially adopted in theory will actually be respected in practice. We cannot wait until December 2008 before we review these cases. I ask the Commission to review them now.

 Mr President, eyes have understandably been on the slaughter in Lebanon. However, we must not allow the world to forget the crimes that are being committed in Gaza, which has effectively been turned into a prison for Palestinians. Let us not forget that since the end of June, over 200 Palestinians – at least 44 of them children – have been killed; nor forget that thousands more have been forced to flee their homes; nor forget that when we talk about the Israeli prisoners, who must indeed be freed, there are also 9 000 Palestinian prisoners who remain in Israeli prisons, over half of whom are detained without trial; nor forget that elected Hamas parliamentarians remain under arrest. It is clear that no long-term peace in the Middle East is possible until we see an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine. There has been much hand-wringing in this Chamber today, saying, ‘if only there were something more we could do as the EU’. We beg the Israeli authorities to unblock the Palestinian revenues that are being withheld; we plead with them to open the border crossings; we beg for an end to the air and sea blockade; we plead with them not to start building yet more illegal settlements; yet nothing really changes. I believe that the time is long overdue to echo the recommendation of the heads of the EU mission in Jerusalem and call for the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the grounds of human rights abuses, as provided for by Article 2 of that Agreement. If we, as the EU, do not take ourselves and our agreements seriously, then we cannot be surprised if others do not either. Madam Commissioner, you said our credibility is at stake. Yes, it is. As the EU, we have serious influence in the Middle East and we should be using it to greater effect.
 Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, I welcome this report not only because of its strong emphasis on the need for respect for human rights in China, but also because it echoes a key finding from my own report on EU economic relations with China, namely that the challenges posed by Chinese competition are not limited to individual sectors like textiles or footwear, but are in fact systemic in nature and require a much more comprehensive approach. The Commission response to date has been to say that Europe simply has to move up the value-added chain; we simply have to diversify into higher-skilled, more specialised work. However, it is rather complacent and patronising to assume that Europe and the West can keep a monopoly on innovation and high-tech solutions, while China simply does the manufacturing. Chinese graduates are rightly, and to their credit, moving up the value-added chain and very soon we may need to face the possibility that there will be very little that Europe can produce which China cannot produce more efficiently. The old colonialist assumption that the EU and the industrialised countries will keep the leading edge in knowledge-intensive industries, while developing countries focus on lower-skilled sectors, is now open to huge debate. Our response to the challenges posed by China needs to include a thorough-going reassessment of the assumptions that have underpinned international trade theory until now. Not for our own sake, necessarily, but certainly for the sake of many workers in developing countries, because the reality is that China’s deflationary pressure is already driving down wages right across the developing world, pushing global suppliers to reduce their workers’ rights and conditions in their bid to remain competitive at all costs, and forcing ILO conventions on freedom of association and bargaining on China is certainly part of the solution. However, I would also ask the Commission to look much more closely at some of its assumptions about the winners and losers from the globalisation process.
 Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE

 Thank you for that reply, Commissioner. I am glad that the study has at least started, despite the fact that we are having to wait until mid-2007, when it was first requested in December 2005. That seems to be quite a long way away, but let us hope it is worth the wait. Could you explain why the EU continues to import birds when countries such as the United States, for example, consider that those same birds are not sustainably harvested? Since 1992 the US has imposed a moratorium on all CITES-listed birds unless it can be scientifically proven that they are harvested in a sustainable way. Since 1992 not a single one has been proved to be sustainably harvested. Many developing countries also have bans on the export of those birds. So how is it that the United States has such a different assessment from the EU as to whether or not they are being sustainably harvested?

 Mr President, I welcome this overdue debate today because, frankly, the declaration of the Presidency issued two days ago falls far short of the response that we should expect of the European Union and risks undermining the EU’s credibility in the region. Clearly that declaration is not balanced: it gives great emphasis to the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier, which it condemns, but spends far fewer words on the completely disproportionate response of the Israeli authorities, which it only ‘regrets’. I am sorry that the representative of the Council has repeated that language and that lack of balance in her introduction this morning. It is not only that, contrary to both international law and humanitarian principle, the Israeli Government has destroyed electricity plants and water distribution networks: it has kidnapped and arrested 64 elected representatives. That follows the terrible massacre on the beach in Gaza. If that had happened anywhere else in the world we could have expected immediate condemnation by the international community. It is quite extraordinary that the Council has only finally spoken out now, and spoken in such muted terms. I believe it vital that we, the European Parliament, speak out and that we condemn in the strongest possible terms the arrest of democratically elected Palestinian representatives. (Applause)
 At the same time we condemn the kidnapping of the captured Israeli soldier and we call for his swift and safe release. But let us not forget, either, the 9 600 Palestinian political prisoners, over half of whom are being detained without trial, nearly 400 of whom are under the age of 18. Let us have some consistency. Secondly, politics is about responding to changing events, and there has been a historic event in recent days that has been tragically overshadowed by the events in Gaza. That event was the agreement of Hamas and Fatah over the so-called prisoners’ document. In recent weeks the international community has called upon Hamas to change and now, as it gradually begins to do so, we should recognise that fact, give credit for that fact and alter our own political response accordingly. In agreeing that national conciliation document, Hamas has demonstrated that it supports the formation of a government of national coalition, that it supports an independent Palestinian state, within the 1967 borders, and that it is taking the first steps towards recognising Israel. We should be clear that the EU must immediately reopen dialogue with the legitimately and democratically elected representatives. The Council must reaffirm its conviction, as it has done, that the negotiated two-state solution is the only one that will bring peace and security, but that means that the EU itself must live up to its responsibilities. Together with the Quartet it must put forward concrete proposals about what it plans to do to help bring about that settled and peaceful resolution. (Applause)

 Mr President, I just want to insert the words ‘in the context of structural and cohesion policy’ into this amendment. The words should be on your voting lists. Essentially we agree that isolated territories have problems, but we believe this would be better addressed through structural and cohesion policies, so I should like to move that oral amendment.

 Mr President, I shall see whether I can do any better with this oral amendment. I wanted to get rid of the word ‘eventually’.

 Air transport is the most commonly used method of long distance travel, and this has had a serious environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. I feel that emission charging and emission trading licenses is an appropriate way of addressing the problem. I also welcome the inclusion in this proposal of internal flights and flights starting or finishing in the EU, and the creation of a single European airspace, which will make it possible to cut down on air routes. Nevertheless, I believe that the attention must be paid to the special case of remote, outlying regions that are difficult to access, and therefore highly dependent on air transport. I am therefore only supporting the report because the amendment providing for special attention to be paid to the outermost regions and remote regions has been adopted. Such regions would have been seriously harmed had the new aviation charges been applied uniformly across the European area.
 Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE

rapporteur
. –
 Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I warmly welcome the Commission’s communication on reducing the climate impact of aviation and that my report strongly supports the Commission’s position that a comprehensive package of measures is needed to address the full impact of aviation on the climate. I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for their good work and collaboration. The starting point for my report is that while aviation has brought a great many benefits to society, its current growth rate is completely unsustainable. Between 1990 and 2003, the EU’s international aviation emissions increased by 73%, corresponding to an annual growth of over 4%. At this rate the increased emissions from aviation will neutralise more than a quarter of the reductions required by the EU’s Kyoto target by 2012. Moreover, crucially, aviation’s total impact on the climate is estimated to be two to four times the CO2 impact, even without considering the potential effects of cirrus cloud enhancement. Of course, the industry’s efforts to reduce its emissions are welcome. However, as Eurocontrol predicts, EU air traffic movements are set to more than double by 2020 compared to 2003. It is clear that rates of technological improvements – which historically run at about 1-2% per year – will be insufficient to offset this enormous growth. It is clear then that action is urgently needed. International aviation is not subject to Kyoto or other commitments. Article 2(2) of the Kyoto Protocol urges states to pursue reduction of greenhouse gases from this source through the International Civil Aviation Organization, but there are currently no plans for a global solution here. That makes it vital that the EU shows leadership and exploits the advantages of laying down an example with early regional action. Council Conclusions of December 2005 reaffirm this, calling for ‘specific action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation if no such action is agreed within the ICAO by 2002’. I therefore welcome the communication’s recognition that we need this comprehensive package of measures, including regulatory, economic, technological and operational instruments. In particular, its plan to pursue the introduction of kerosene taxes is very important, given the existing imbalance between the treatment of aviation and other modes of transport. This should begin right away with a tax on all domestic and intra-EU flights – with the possibility of exemption for all carriers on routes where non-EU carriers operate. The ongoing renegotiations of air service agreements must continue so that third-country carriers can gradually be taxed on an equal basis with EU carriers. Ending the VAT exemption would further level the playing field, and bring fiscal as well as environmental benefits. Colleagues will see that I have brought back an amendment to seek to achieve this. Improvements in air traffic management could reduce average fuel burn by between 8% and 18%, with resultant decreases in all engine emissions. All of these measures are necessary, but the main focus of the Commission’s proposals and therefore of my report is on emissions trading. I agree that it has the potential to play a role, but only provided any scheme is properly designed. First, it is clear that other policy instruments must be introduced alongside an emissions trading system to address the full climatic impact. Instruments directly linked to the impact in question, such as a NOx charge, would be most likely to induce the most efficient behaviour, although multipliers on CO2 emissions are an interim alternative. This is crucial, because if there is not a parallel emissions charge or multiplier formula to cover aviation’s non-CO2 impacts, the effect of buying the right to emit a tonne of CO2 from another sector with much lower non-CO2 impacts would actually be a net disbenefit to the environment. Second, and crucially, a separate closed system for aviation is crucial at the very least as a pilot scheme because, apart from the administrative difficulties of including aviation in the EU’s general ETS, many sectors already in that scheme are concerned about the possible effect of aviation’s inclusion on carbon prices, noting that as a sheltered sector, aviation will be able tolerate higher prices than many others. There is a very real risk that excessive pressure on vulnerable, energy-intensive industries could lead to a loosening of the overall cap. It would also be impractical for aviation to join the general ETS before 2012. I do not think we can afford to wait another six years before we act, so good use could be made of the period 2008-2012 by running at least a pilot scheme. Any arrangement by which aviation was ultimately incorporated into a wider ETS would also need a cap on the number of emission rights the aviation sector could buy from the market to ensure that aviation itself begins to make some of these cuts. Finally, if colleagues are in any doubt about the importance of a separate scheme, they should consider the words of a chief economist of British Airways, who admitted last week that if airlines joined the existing emissions trading system their emissions would simply continue to grow at an alarming rate: they would simply buy up the right to emit as ever, their own emissions would not go down, and we would still see aviation having a massive accountability for the climate crisis. Therefore, I urge colleagues to vote for this report, which will send a very clear signal to the Commission and to the Council that Parliament is looking for ambitious but realistic proposals in this field. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would like to thank Erika Mann for all her work on this report and for her willingness and openness to at least consider other perspectives and views. However, I do still have some concerns about it. Firstly, there is at least a question mark over whether now is the right time, politically, to be advancing a policy of what is essentially a bilateral free trade area. We are in a time when the multilateral system is in crisis. We have therefore to consider what political message we are sending by doing that. Secondly, my concern is that by pursuing extremely controversial issues such as the liberalisation of investment, public procurement and services in a projected transatlantic free trade area, other countries could well perceive that as the EU and US setting the stage for transferring the negotiations over to the global level. As you know, they have been extremely highly contested in the WTO framework. Finally, on the issue of regulation and harmonisation, in spite of amendments and some nice rhetoric to the contrary, there is a risk that we will see a levelling down – rather than a levelling up – of hard-won environmental health and consumer standards.
 Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE

 Mr President, funding is threatening the very existence of Palestinian institutions and there is a very real risk that they will collapse. Teachers and doctors have not been paid for months and it is the Palestinian people, civilians, who are paying the price of the EU’s position, which represents a collective punishment against the Palestinian people for their democratic choices. Not only that, but it is also utterly counter-productive. To suspend funding is to undermine the very political and judicial reforms which the EU has been supporting; to suspend funding is to drive people into the arms of extremists and into the arms of Iran in particular, with risks of much greater fundamentalist influence. You talk about principles, but it is vital that the EU is consistent. You cannot make demands of Hamas that you do not make of Israel. Yes, mutual recognition and an end to violence on both sides are urgently needed, but it has to be on both sides. Israel has to recognise Palestine and to stop its state violence too. So my question to the Council is this: in the coming days the Israeli Government will be formed. Will the Council ask the new Israeli Government if it is committed to the roadmap and to the past agreement as presented by the Quartet, and will it ask if the Israeli Government is committed to a cessation of violence against the Palestinians, just as we ask Hamas to do all in its power to end violence against Israel?

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Doyle for her excellent collaboration and for being so willing to try to find compromises on which we could all agree. But having said that, while my Group can live with the directive on mobile air-conditioning – although in our view it is still too weak – we cannot accept the results of the conciliation on the regulation on F-gases, in spite of Mrs Doyle's good offices to try to get a better deal, but which ultimately failed. The European institutions like to pride themselves on their international leadership in terms of policy on climate change, the greatest threat we face, and yet this regulation is a tragedy of missed opportunity and sets back the potential of our climate policy by decades. We are talking about gases that have enormous global warming potential. They include sulphur hexafluoride, which is over 23 000 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and yet will still be permitted in some applications. Yet what we have in front of us is a regulation with a legal base that casts doubt on the ongoing right of Austria and Denmark to keep their stricter national laws beyond six years and that will actively work against the ability of other Member States to adopt them. We have a regulation that fails to recognise the fact that alternatives already exist for most F-gas applications, that fails to promote substitution and that will set back the introduction of safe and innovative alternatives for years, not just in the European Union but in the developing world as well, where F-gas emissions are predicted to grow enormously over the next few decades. We have a regulation that represents a shameful capitulation to the F-gas industry. So I repeat again the question that others have raised: Would the Commission clarify once and for all whether it will drop the proceedings against Austria and Denmark? At the very beginning of February my colleagues and I wrote to Commissioner Dimas to ask this question. We have still not received a response. This is unacceptable and the proceedings should be dropped immediately.

 Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Trakatellis’s report. I thank and congratulate him for his excellent work on it. I also want to add my voice to those who deplore the reduced funding for the area concerned. My group will support Amendment 64. In fact my group originally proposed an even higher level of funding, as you may recall. I should like to highlight, once again, one of the key issues that has already been raised and on which my group has tabled an amendment, namely the contribution of complementary and alternative medicine. Over 100 million EU citizens are already using complementary medicine and its popularity is growing rapidly. Improving people’s knowledge about complementary and alternative medicine can be an important way of enabling them to make more responsible and better informed choices about their health. Therefore, I believe it is vital that we bring that area of medicine out of the ghetto and into the mainstream and recognise the very real benefits it can bring. Heightened public awareness of the dangers of chemicals in the food chain, growing resistance to antibiotics through over-use and concern about the side-effects of some conventional drugs are all contributing to a massive re-think about the way we live and how we seek to regain our health. Complementary medicines with a holistic and person-centred approach are attracting an ever-widening public. It is important to acknowledge that as a phenomenon. Yet there is still a huge disparity between public demand for those medicines and the negligible amount of funding for research in that field. It is vital that we close that gap. I strongly support those amendments which refer to the seriousness of environmental pollution as a risk to health and a major source of concern for European citizens. That needs to be addressed urgently as part of a preventive healthcare strategy. As Mrs Breyer has already set out, our group believes that the participation of civil society is vitally important to the formulation and implementation of European health policy. I welcome the proposed increase in funding to enable its greater involvement, as I do the criteria outlined in Amendment 53, which makes clear the need for independence from industry, commercial and business interests. Amendment 141, by the Liberals, however, muddies the water and takes away precisely the legal certainty that Amendment 53 sets out. For that reason I would urge colleagues to reject it.

 Mr President, this resolution provides a vital opportunity for Parliament to send a strong resolution to the parties meeting in Brazil about the value that Europe’s citizens place on the world’s natural resources and biodiversity. I want to focus on just two such resources. The world’s last ancient forests are being lost at a rate of more than 13 million hectares a year with devastating impact. A global network of protected forest areas must be established and funded, and countries must set measurable time-ban targets to ensure that the use, consumption and trade of biodiversity resources come only from sustainable sources. We must also urgently speak out on the issue of crops engineered using terminator technologies. These crops produce sterile seeds so farmers will be unable to save seeds from one year’s crops to sow the next, forcing them into buying seeds each year from biotech corporations whose control over seeds is already enormous: just ten corporations control more than 50% of global seed sales. The consequences for food security, especially in developing countries and for the livelihoods of poor farmers, would be huge. Any proposals to undermine the moratorium on field testing and marketing of these suicide seeds must be firmly rejected, and that is what our group has tabled an amendment on tomorrow to strengthen that point.

. – Mr President, there is a certain sense of déjà vu in this debate. Although anti-dumping is indeed different from the example of the multi-fibre arrangement, I believe it is no coincidence that this crisis follows the end of quotas. It is clear that in a world of completely deregulated and unfettered free trade the so-called ‘China price’ will drag costs and standards down right across the globe, with the harshest impact on the poorest. I believe we will see more cases of this kind until we recognise that the way forward is through a system of quotas that enables everyone to benefit from trade, rather than just a few. Mr Mandelson talks about Europe being able to adapt by moving up the value-added chain, but we have had this discussion many times. He knows my view that essentially China is going to do exactly the same, and why wouldn’t it? That is not going to provide a solution for Europe and it is not going to provide a solution for the rest of the world either. What is interesting about this case is the extraordinary lengths that the Commission appears to have gone to in order to give the impression that this is a much less serious case than it is. It almost feels as if the neo-liberal dogma and ideology are getting the better of the facts on the ground. There are, therefore, some key questions to be answered, including the level of duties, based on injury, that the Commissioner has found: 19.4% for China and 16.8% for Vietnam. Those are apparently based on adjustments never used in the European Community before. There is real concern in the industry that they will not be enough. The exemption of children’s and sports shoes has the effect of excluding around 42% of footwear imported at dumping prices, yet for which dumping duties will not be paid. I do not believe that is fair to European producers; but it is not fair to Chinese workers either, who are working for pitiful wages – around USD 12 per week, as mentioned in reports of China Labor Watch
 – while at the same time social rights are reduced to an absolute minimum. Unless we suppose that the consumer is benefiting, I believe it is worth noting that the anti-dumping duties are not likely to lead to increased consumer prices, but to decrease the profit margins of the importers. I believe that we need to be genuinely concerned about the impact of competition from companies based in China – not just on Europe, but on poorer countries such as the EuroMed countries – and recognise that until we have a system of managed trade, the winners will always be concentrated in a handful of ever fewer countries and the losers will prove to be the majority.

 Mr President, I thank the Commissioner. One of the reasons why we are discussing this issue tonight is because there is an international conference in Paris at the end of this month, a key opportunity to make progress on the subject of innovative sources of finance for development. My group particularly welcomes the fact that this meeting looks set to agree an air ticket levy with proceeds going to benefit some of the world’s poorest people. Of course there are a range of other tools and instruments as well. Mrs Kinnock has already spoken very eloquently about the benefits of the IFF. However, I believe that the air ticket levy is also important because it marks a turning point in the quest for the introduction of global levies for the financing of global development needs. It deserves our full support. I would stress, however, that the new finances must be genuinely new: in other words, additional to, and not a substitute for, existing development budgets. I am very glad that the Commission will be represented at the meeting in Paris, but I would like to know whether it has plans to encourage the other Member States to go, whether there will be a mechanism for feeding back to Parliament the results of the meeting in Paris, and whether there are plans to share the contents of the workshop that took place on 9 February between the Commission and the Council. I am sure that many of us would be very interested to know.

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, I wish to say that, in spite of the good offices of the rapporteur, we believe the compromise in front of us is unacceptably weak. That is why my group will be abstaining in tomorrow’s vote. With that abstention, we intend to indicate the following. First, that the values agreed on fresh water protection are completely unclear: the parameters have been so tampered with by statistical changes that the degree of protection they will provide is extremely dubious. According to the peer-reviewed article about to appear in the scientific journal Environmental Health Perspectives
, which was mentioned by Mr Maaten, these values will bring no improvement for the quality of fresh water at all. Second, the real opportunity we had to extend this directive to cover recreational uses has been completely lost in the compromise. Third, after a strong fight for higher standards, Parliament’s delegation suddenly dropped all of its demands after the Council offered a minimal increase of one of the two standards of the sufficient category. Finally, the process by which this final agreement was reached was highly unsatisfactory, with last-minute technical proposals being introduced – verbally, not in writing – and with no time to properly study their implications. This is a disappointing result, but, in spite of that, I should like to thank everyone involved. I appreciate that it is not an easy business, but we will be abstaining tomorrow.

 Mr President, there seems to be a widening gulf between the EU rhetoric on this WTO round – which has the word ‘development’ written into almost every sentence – and the reality, which is that the majority of developing countries are continuing to be ignored. This gulf extends to the contradiction between what the Council is saying and what the Commission is doing. Alan Johnson, a UK Trade Minister and representative of the UK Presidency, said just a few weeks ago that developing countries must not be forced to open up their markets. He proclaimed that ‘we must reject forced liberalisation’, and yet the Commission is adopting an increasingly aggressive negotiating agenda that is diametrically opposed to this. On non-agriculture market access the Commission is demanding far-reaching liberalisation that will threaten the very survival of local manufacturing in some developing countries. On services, the Commission has completely discarded its former promises about service negotiations being voluntary, and is now demanding a mandatory minimum opening of the market. There is supreme irony, Commissioner Mandelson, in your being quoted in the newspapers today as saying that one voice which has not been heard in these negotiations so far is the voice of the poor, when the European Union is itself guilty of ignoring precisely that voice: the voice of African countries and other ACP countries, for example, which have all said they do not want a new benchmarking formula in the services sector. We are in real danger of repeating the mistakes made in Cancun. The EU is failing to listen to developing countries and is pursuing its own business agenda with extraordinary arrogance. A resolution has been tabled by the three larger political groups and I want to explain why our group is unable to sign it. No date has been set for an end to export subsidies. Indeed, ending export subsidies is now made conditional on parallel movement from other industrialised countries. On services, the resolution demands an ambitious agreement with no rejection of the new benchmarking formula, and no clear exclusion of basic services such as water. On NAMA, there is a demand for rapid acceleration of negotiations on the basis of an extreme formula which most developing countries have already rejected. Extraordinarily, it is suggested that WTO members should remove their non-tariff barriers since they apparently hamper market access. Those so-called non-tariff barriers include hard-won democratically agreed national laws that protect the environment, social standards and health and they must not be regarded simply as barriers to trade. Most important of all, however, is the pressing fact that four years into the DDA, the agenda is not delivering for the poor of the world. We need a radical and fundamental revision of trade policy so that this genuinely can be a development round worthy of the name.

 Madam President, I should like to thank the Commission and Council for their statements. I have to say though that I do not share Mrs Beckett’s upbeat assessment of how the European Union is doing, despite the British Government’s pledge to make climate change a priority for its Presidency. Progress on the ground has been very disappointing. Hearing the G8 communiqué on climate change being called ambitious stretches the English language almost to breaking point. If the British Presidency is genuinely going to show international leadership on this subject, then it has to get its own house in order first. Earlier this year, we commissioned a report from the Association for the Conservation of Energy to assess how well this government has been implementing existing European laws on reducing fossil-fuel use. Their findings made clear that this is a government which has delayed implementation of the directive on the energy performance of buildings, demanded an increase in the UK’s level of CO2 emissions permitted under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, failed to set binding targets for energy-demand reduction under the energy services directive, and failed to promote small-scale combined heat and power plants in line with the cogeneration directive. This is why the Council should take particular notice of the European Parliament’s report on climate change, which has been expertly drafted by Anders Wijkman. There they will find a genuinely bold and ambitious call to action. In particular, the report demands strong emission reductions at home, starting with 20% to 30% domestic reductions in the EU by 2020, increasing to between 60% and 80% by 2050. It calls for the goal to make Europe the most energy-efficient economy in the world by setting targets for annual reduction in energy of the order of 2.5% to 3% and for a robust strategy for Montreal. And, in our amendment, the Greens are calling on the EU to ensure a formal mandate and timetable for negotiating future climate commitments with a time limit for achieving agreement at the end of 2008. I want to end with two quick questions for the Council. First, what is its view on contraction and convergence as a framework for future action? Second, alongside the inclusion of aviation in the emissions trading scheme, will the Council propose instruments in parallel to tackle the full climate impact of aviation since, as we know, the Emissions Trading Scheme will not cover emissions that are not CO2 related?

 Mr President, many in my group have highlighted the enormous weaknesses in the Sacconi-Nassauer compromise in terms of health and the environment and of course I agree with them. However, I want to focus on the additional weaknesses of that compromise from an animal welfare perspective. Concerning data sharing, for example, the compromise provides far too many loopholes. While groups of companies would be permitted to bring forward a single registration, separate registrations would still be allowed, making it much more likely that repeat animal tests will take place. The proposal would allow data over ten years old to be freely shared, reducing if not eliminating the possibility that repeat tests would take place. The compromise, by contrast, only allows data over 15 years old to be shared, again increasing the likelihood that repeat tests would be undertaken. This is completely unacceptable since, as well as being extremely cruel, animal testing is crude and inefficient. The problems of extrapolating test results from animals to people and from laboratory doses to real life are now well documented. Just last week an article in the scientific journal Nature
 described regulatory animal testing as being ‘stuck in a timewarp, largely based on wasteful and poorly predictive animal experiments’. That is why I tabled amendments to Annexes V to VIII of REACH. Many of these were adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, a move that has already helped to increase the pressure on the Commission and industry to push for further work on non-animal tests. However, if we are to seek a better approach we must not let this opportunity to force greater scrutiny of animal tests to pass us by. We must challenge conventional assumptions about animal test methods and scrutinise test methods with as much rigour as we scrutinise other aspects of this proposed new chemicals policy, because exposing animal tests to scrutiny will prompt the kind of debate we cannot afford to ignore. If we ignore it, then REACH and all future chemicals regulation will be tied to test methods that deserve only to be consigned to history. Lord Bach said that the vote on REACH is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I agree and that is why it is so important we get it right.

 Mr President, I just want to propose that we change the word ‘mutation’ to ‘recombination’ in the amendment. The PSE Group has indicated that it would be in favour of this. This is essentially just a technical change, but, scientifically speaking, you cannot prevent mutation of H5N1, much as we would like to and powerful though we might think we are. We might, however, have a chance of preventing recombination, so I would like to have the word ‘mutation’ changed please.

 – Mr President, it is absolutely essential that the EU is fully prepared for an influenza pandemic and that we learn the lessons from the past, for example, from the foot-and-mouth crisis in Europe, so that contingency plans are well-known, communication lines are clear and coordination properly planned. The current threat of the mutation of avian flu demonstrates the role industry must play. Patent holders must allow the production of generic alternatives in poorer countries. We must also take urgent practical steps: an immediate ban on imports of wild birds into the EU, and improved bio-security, particularly in the international poultry industry. In our amendments, we are also proposing that, as a priority, poultry farmers be offered common, seasonal influenza vaccination, in order to reduce the chances of recombination between human and avian influenza viruses at one of the most important potential interfaces, as Mr Trakatellis has said. Since international travel is likely to form the key mode of transmission, we are proposing that there should be systematic virological screenings of air filters from flights originating in countries affected by the virus. Lastly, a question to the Commissioner: will he rule out a mass cull of wild birds, since evidence suggests it is likely to be counter-productive, dispersing infected individuals and making healthy birds more prone to disease due to stress? I would be very grateful for an answer to that question.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Blokland for his good work on this piece of legislation, but my Group is disappointed with the compromise package and we have therefore submitted a number of amendments. For example, waste should only be shipped where truly necessary and unfortunately the proposed regulation is not as strong as it should be on this. A particularly important case here is that of persistent organic pollutants. The regulation implementing the Stockholm Convention does not deal with a shipment of POPs as or contained in waste, so the waste shipment regulation urgently needs to do so. This would help to avoid shipments of POPs in waste from countries that could and should deal with the waste themselves. If this provision had been in place two years ago, the export of the so-called ‘ghost fleet’ – dilapidated US navy ships full of PCBs sailing from the US to the UK – could have been stopped on legal grounds. Regrettably, the compromise does not cover this issue. Neither does it properly address dismantling of ships. Large numbers of EU ships will soon need to be scrapped following the recent and welcome decision to accelerate the phase-out of single-hull tankers, but there is a very real danger that they will be dumped on Asian beaches to be dealt with under very poor conditions. For these reasons my Group will be abstaining and not voting in favour of this package.

 Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Doyle for her excellent work on this issue. My Group fully supports the change in the regulation's legal basis to Article 175. The sole objective of this regulation is, clearly, climate protection. It should be remembered that these gases were already included, in 1997, in the basket of gases to be controlled under the Kyoto Protocol and that this regulation emerged from a specific programme called the European Climate Change programme. So we should not be fooled by the pro-F-gas lobbyists who argue both for avoiding a change of legal basis and for maintenance of the status quo for their climate-destructive products. Climate-friendly alternatives exist for almost all applications, or are in development. None of the phase-outs and bans proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is unrealistic, as some would claim, since they all take into consideration exemptions where safety standards require. I would also point out that f-gases were pushed onto the market as replacements for CFCs, which cause ozone depletion and skin cancers, precisely by the same big chemical companies – like DuPont or, in my own country, Ineos, as ICI is now known – that were, themselves, major producers of ozone-destroying substances. This Parliament should stand firm and put the environment and the well-being of Europe’s citizens before the narrow corporate interests of those chemical giants.

 Mr President, I speak on behalf of one of my constituents, John Packwood, a British citizen who has recently been extradited from Spain to Morocco to face charges of drug smuggling in spite of a complete lack of evidence. Not only has he suffered a gross miscarriage of justice, but he is also the victim of discrimination on grounds of nationality, contrary to the letter and spirit of EU law. Mr Packwood was extradited under a highly discriminatory treaty between Spain and Morocco. It exempts Spanish nationals from extradition, but provides that other EU nationals can be extradited without the Spanish authorities being in any way obliged to investigate the merits of the case. This is directly contrary to the EC Treaty ban on discrimination on the grounds of nationality and is fundamentally incompatible with the values of the EU. I therefore call on the President of the Parliament and, in particular, Commissioner Frattini to take action to ensure the reality of an EU area of freedom, justice and security is put in place, by remedying both the injustice and the discrimination Mr Packwood is suffering. Would the President of the Parliament please write to the Moroccan authorities to raise this?

 Mr President, if this new EU strategy were really adding value to existing programmes and polices, my group would support it. Africa urgently needs our strong support, including technology transfer, debt cancellation, resources for development and fair terms of trade delivered in a coherent way. I hope this strategy will deliver greater coherence and added value. However, I am not convinced, not least because it does not evaluate the impact of our past policies and does not foresee any additional financial instrument to deliver better policies in the future. What it offers is more of the same failed policies, because the shocking fact is that the number of people living in poverty in Africa continues to grow. What we need from the Commission is not a change of documents, but a change of policy, in particular trade policy, which continues to undermine Africa’s development potential. On economic partnership agreements, ACP countries must have the guarantee of continued non-reciprocal access if they choose it. At the World Trade Organization, the Commission must ensure that negotiations on non-agricultural market access take into full account the needs of African countries to protect their infant industries. On commodity prices, we must have action to reverse declining commodity prices. On services, the Commission must abandon its new benchmarking proposal that would force poorer countries to open their service sectors, in complete contradiction to what the Commission has guaranteed in the past about flexibility on services. On agriculture, of course, we need a complete end to export dumping, as well as support to African countries, to enable them to protect their agriculture up to the point of self-sufficiency. The agenda of liberalisation, privatisation and deregulation has failed to deliver growth or poverty eradication. A new strategy must be based on new values: the values of fair trade and cooperation, rather than free trade and more competition. That is what we need to see from the Commission.

 Mr President, it is very timely that we are having this debate on my China report straight after the debate on textiles. The thrust of my report is that the textiles industry is really just the tip of the iceberg. We are talking about textiles today, but tomorrow it will be footwear, the day after that it will be bicycles, and then automobiles, machine components or high-tech goods. What we are facing here is not just a one-off issue limited to one sector, but a systemic issue, a challenge of much greater scope than I believe the Commission recognises. What we have heard from Mr Kovács echoes what we hear all the time from Mr Mandelson too. To be honest, it is not very reassuring. What we are hearing from the Commission is an extraordinarily complacent and also rather patronising attitude that somehow, all we need to do in the European Union is to move a little bit further up the higher value-added chain and even perhaps to give up what is left of our old manufacturing base and concentrate instead on the knowledge-based industries. That kind of idea seems to be in complete denial of the fact that China is developing its own lower-cost but highly-skilled expertise in those areas too. Almost 20% of China's exports are now classified as high-tech. With over 2 million graduates every single year, there is every reason to believe that percentage will grow. The traditional assumption that the EU and US will keep leading in knowledge-intensive industries, while developing countries will somehow just be left to focus on the lower-skilled areas, is rightly being seriously contested. This is a patronising and complacent attitude and one that is completely out of date and out of tune with where we are today. That is why my report calls on the Commission to rethink its strategy, to wake up to the fact that old fashioned concepts of national comparative advantage simply no longer apply in a world where brain power can zip round the globe at the flick of a computer key. The importance of rethinking that old trade paradigm is crucial, not just for employment in the EU, but also for the survival of many developing countries' industries as well, including some of the poorest in the developing world. To take the example of textiles again, we have heard already in the debate how countries such as Bangladesh, Laos, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal all depend on textile and clothing for the vast majority of their industrial exports. Many of them face devastation as a result of increasing volumes of cheap Chinese exports. Not only are they facing the closure of their own factories, but we are seeing Chinese competitive pressures forcing down social standards, This essentially savage free trade dogma means that some of the poorest countries in the world are being thrown into cut-throat competition with one another in a race to the bottom on wages, social standards and, basically, anything that can be made cheaper. In the Philippines the government has ruled that the minimum wage will no longer apply in the textiles sector. In Bangladesh restrictions on night work and overtime are being lifted. We are seeing these key standards that have been fought over for very many years now being rolled back in the name of trying to be ever more competitive. As well as demanding a complete reassessment of the trade model, it is clear that we also urgently need to redouble our efforts to ensure that international trade is based on a platform of minimum social and environmental standards. It is clear, unfortunately, that China's competitiveness is built, at least in part, on its exploitation of its workers and on its externalisation of social and environmental costs. For example, although in theory at least China has strict laws when it comes to what is in its rule books, in practice those laws are flouted time and again. It is a shocking fact that over 100 000 people per year are estimated to die in work-related accidents in China. The report calls for minimum social standards, the ILO standards, trade union standards, and cooperation between European trade unions and those groups that are trying to set up similar bodies in China. It also looks at the environmental impact of the development model which we in the West have also followed. We need to change it, but what we see in China is the acceleration of that model. The impact is clearly a massive one on the resources of other nations. China is already the world's second largest consumer of oil and water and trails only the US in CO2 emissions. It is only by challenging the key free trade model that we can really make sure that all workers in the world have the chance to earn a decent livelihood. I urge Members to support this report.

 Mr President, as you know, we have just been discussing my report on EU-China trade relations, but the debate is not yet finished. I propose that, while the rest of the debate takes place this afternoon, the actual vote be postponed until the Brussels part-session in two weeks' time. This is an important report and there should be a full House here to vote on it, not just the 40 or 50 Members who might still be here at 5 p.m. I am afraid that I myself will not be here at 5 p.m., as I have another engagement this evening. The change to the agenda that shifted my report from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. this morning was made only very recently. That is what caused this problem. I formally move that we postpone the vote until the Brussels part-session in two weeks' time. (Applause)

 Mr President, I thank Mrs Saïfi for her timely report and believe that the end of the Multifibre Agreement poses a very great challenge to a great many countries around the world. The World Bank and the World Trade Organization predict that as a result of the abolition of all quotas China’s share of world trade in textiles and clothing will rise from 17% in 2003 to over 50% by 2010. Some argue that to date China’s imports have mostly grown at the expense of imports from other third countries which have seen their share of the EU market decrease, but it is already very clear that the EU textile and clothing industry is experiencing significant pressure. According to the European apparel and textile organisation, Eurotex, the sector could risk losing 1 000 jobs a day and up to a million jobs before the end of 2006. I welcome the steps that the Commission has finally taken to address the problem but I wonder what makes them so confident that a few years’ breathing space will really make any long-term difference. Since the sector in the EU has already had ten years in which to make adaptations to this new reality, what more will they do in the next few years that they have not already done? My concern in saying that is that the Commission is underestimating the size of the challenge we face. Its response has been to urge European manufacturers to produce higher-value products rather than competing with China on basics, yet China’s ability to climb rapidly the value-added ladder across so many sectors shows how unhelpful this advice is. The Commission has also failed to acknowledge that this challenge is a systemic one, not a one-off sectoral one. The textile sector is likely to be only the first sector among many. As Mr Karim has just said, we already know that there are many other sectors that are about to cause us concern in terms of Chinese competition. I am thinking of footwear, bicycles, machine components, and also high-tech goods. But if the impact in the EU will be severe, in many parts of the developing world it will be devastating, especially for women who are disproportionately represented in these sectors. In 2000 textiles and clothing accounted for 95% of all Bangladesh’s industrial goods exports. In Laos they accounted for 93%, Cambodia 83%, Pakistan 73%, the list goes on. The sector employed nearly 2 million workers in Bangladesh, 1.4 million workers in Pakistan. Little wonder, then, that several dozen countries led by Bangladesh and Mauritius made an eleventh hour appeal to the World Trade Organization to save their textile industries. It is very unfortunate that their appeal fell on deaf ears, because China’s deflationary pressures are already driving down wages, pushing global suppliers to reduce their workers’ rights and conditions in a bid to remain competitive. In the Philippines, for example, the government has ruled that its law on the minimum wage will no longer apply to the clothing industry. The Bangladeshi government has recently announced that it will increase the number of authorised overtime hours and reduce the restriction on women’s night work. Now, part of the solution undoubtedly lies in pressure on China to meet social and environmental standards, so that its competitive advantage is not based on the appalling exploitation of workers or the environment. But that alone is not enough. The challenge posed by China raises some fundamental questions about the logic and direction of free trade itself and it demonstrates the destruction that happens when a country has not just a comparative advantage but a more or less absolute advantage in so many areas. The old theories about free trade always being a win-win arrangement are shown to be fundamentally flawed and therefore the Commission urgently needs to undertake more research in order to understand these new trends better and formulate appropriate policy approaches. Finally, I just want to say that I regret that two of the amendments submitted today link textiles and REACH. I think those amendments are very misleading and unhelpful and unfortunately, largely because of those amendments, my Group will abstain on the final vote on this report.

 Mr President, I have just come back from the civil society alternative G8 meetings in Edinburgh, where thousands of people debated how to make poverty history. I want to highlight two important conclusions. First, free trade is not the answer to Africa’s problems. While moves to cancel some African countries’ debts are welcome and long overdue, the policy conditionality in the package on offer, the enforced liberalisation and privatisation, are as onerous as the debt it relieves. Second, poverty in Africa is not the result of some kind of accident of nature. I was very happy to hear Jack Straw agree that poverty is man-made, but amazed that the men he had in mind were ones that lived in Africa alone, not in the G8. Poverty in Africa is largely the direct and logical consequence of the policies of the G8 nations and their corporations, which have been driving Africa’s accumulation of debt, which have been selling weapons, which have been stealing Africa’s resources, which have been enforcing neo-liberal economics, which have been privatising public services and which have collectively impoverished so many millions of people. Until that changes, until we have an approach based on ... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, just a few weeks ago a bus in Nepal drove into an anti-tank mine that had been put on the road by rebels. More than 60 civilians died. That incident – just one among many thousands – highlights the appalling damage that can be caused by modern anti-tank mines. The ban on anti-personnel landmines set out by the Ottawa Treaty was an important first step. However, for a truly mine-free world, it is vital that we go beyond this and call for a comprehensive ban that covers all types of mines, including anti-tank mines and fragmentation bombs. I am sorry that the PPE-DE Group cannot join us on this. The horrific incident in Nepal illustrates the urgent need to allow specialist NGOs to involve non-state actors as well in cleaning mines from areas under their control. We must not forget the role played by financial institutions. I warmly welcome the initiative taken by private Belgian banks to stop investing in companies involved in the production of landmines. The EU and Member States should work hard to make this fine example of corporate social responsibility legally binding throughout Europe. I hope we will send a strong message tomorrow by adopting this excellent resolution and take forward the vital campaign to finally eliminate the scourge of mines, which has killed and maimed so many.

 Mr President, in the past Mr Blair has said that climate change is the biggest threat that we face. He said that it would be a priority for the British presidency. Yet, Mr Blair, we have had just half a sentence on climate change from you in your speech here today. Moreover, yours is a government under which greenhouse gas emissions have actually risen. Yours is a government which has attempted to increase the volume of emissions allowable to British industry under the EU emissions trading scheme. That is hardly a very good start for someone who is pledging to show international leadership on the issue of climate change. I would like to challenge you to make three key assurances about your presidency. First, to promote mandatory targets for energy efficiency across the European Union. Second, to adopt targets for renewables which are consistent with a reduction of between 30 to 40 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. Third, to rule out nuclear power as any kind of so-called solution to reducing CO2 emissions. When you lecture the rest of Europe about the merits of modernisation, competition and flexibility, yet leave out any reference at all to sustainability: it completely undermines any claims you make to be committed to sustainable development. Yes, Europe must change as you say, but unless that change puts sustainability at its heart then your presidency will lose a vital opportunity to help the European Union regain public support and it will squander a key moment to address climate change seriously.

 Mr President, clearly there are very real concerns about the impact of China on other players in the international trading system. We have already heard about the impact of the surge in textile imports on the EU and the devastation some EU producers face as a result. But let us not forget the impact on other developing countries. China’s deflationary pressure is already driving down wages right across the developing world and pushing global suppliers to reduce their workers’ rights and conditions in a bid to remain competitive at all costs. In the Philippines, for example, the government has ruled that its law on the minimum wage would not longer apply to the clothing industry. In Bangladesh, the government recently announced that it would increase the number of authorised overtime hours and reduce the restrictions on women’s night work. Chinese workers themselves do not necessarily have much to gain either, facing seven-day working weeks, very low wages, appalling health and safety hazards and no trade unions. We are looking here at a downward spiral of social and environmental standards; certainly minimum international standards might help stem that downward spiral. It is most important for this debate not just to focus on this or that sector, textiles today or footwear or machine components tomorrow. What we are looking at here is a systemic problem. It is a challenge posed by a country that has entered the international trading system not just with a comparative advantage but with potentially an almost absolute advantage in just about everything. It is complacent and patronising to assume that Europe and the West can keep a monopoly on innovation and high-tech while China simply does the manufacturing. Chinese graduates are also moving up the value-added chain. Very soon we may need to face the possibility that there could be very little that Europe could produce that China cannot produce more efficiently. The old assumption that while the EU and the industrialised countries keep the leading edge in knowledge-intensive industries while developing nations focus on lower-skill sectors, is now open to huge debate. The response to the challenge posed by China needs to include a thorough reassessment of the assumptions that have underpinned international trade theory up until now. We need to look again at the old ideas dating from David Ricardo onwards that comparative advantage always works in everybody’s best interests. I hope the Commission will act swiftly on textiles. I would also like to hear what the Commissioner plans to do about these longer-term systemic issues. We need a more balanced view than this oral question suggests. We should be looking at some of the impacts of liberalisation on China itself, because there is ample proof to suggest that many of the poorest people in China face significant losses themselves, particularly in the agricultural sector, as a result of China’s accession to the WTO. So let us have a more balanced view; a view that looks into the future as well.

 Mr President, I thank Mr Moreno Sánchez for his work on this issue, but I think it will come as no surprise to him that, unfortunately, our Group cannot support his report as it stands. While there are some good parts, highlighting the aims of sustainable development and poverty eradication, these are sadly undermined by the overall direction of the report, which is an uncritical endorsement of deregulated free trade as the principal means of achieving those goals. The assumption still seems to be that more trade automatically equals more growth, which automatically equals more poverty reduction, yet the reality on the ground is quite different and, as the recent UNDP Least Developed Countries report makes clear, greater integration of some of the poorest countries into the international trading system has generally not led to poverty reduction amongst the poorest people. Another assumption underpinning the report is that, if only the WTO’s critics understood the institution more, then somehow we would mysteriously fall in love with it, or, as the report puts it, ‘the WTO must provide adequate information and explanations to civil society [...] in order to avoid the process of globalisation and the role played by the WTO being widely misunderstood and misrepresented’. Quite frankly, this is unhelpful and patronising nonsense. Increasingly, large sections of civil society know exactly what the WTO is about, and they know precisely how damaging the process of economic globalisation can be. What we need is not a cosmetic public relations exercise but a fundamental, thoroughgoing reform of the institutions and the rules of world trade so that sustainability and equity are genuinely put at their heart. Now to some of the detail: our Group has retabled its original amendment on commodity prices. Falling commodity prices is one of the single greatest reasons why poorer countries do not get a fairer deal out of world trade. As many as 43 developing countries depend on a single commodity for more than 20% of their total export revenues. If prices for the 10 most important agricultural commodities exported by developing countries had risen in line with inflation since 1980, those exporters would have received around USD 112 billion more in 2002 than they actually did, which would have been twice the level of official development assistance. Frankly, I find it extraordinary that the Committee on International Trade, which prides itself on saying that trade should support poverty eradication, could have rejected an amendment which sought action on stabilising commodity prices. I hope that the plenary will support us on that tomorrow. We have also tabled an amendment on the Commission mandate. It is hard to imagine what justification the Commission can possibly have for working on a mandate that is six years old and which, therefore, fails to reflect any of the important changes that have happened since it was agreed. Perhaps Mr Mandelson could tell us what that justification is because, from an institutional perspective, we cannot pretend that, after two out of the last three ministerials ended in collapse, we are dealing with business as usual. We cannot ignore the resistance of many countries in the south to embark on more and more new competences for the WTO. Now that a new Commission is in office and as the new WTO Ministerial approaches, we should give a sign to the international community that Europe reflects these changes and is able to learn from the mistakes made in both Seattle and Cancún.

 Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Kinnock on an excellent report. I am very happy to introduce the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, which was passed unanimously and adopted en bloc
 by the Committee on Development. That demonstrates the growing consensus that while trade clearly has a role in poverty eradication, the current trends and institutions of trade policy will need urgent reform if they are genuinely to lead to poverty eradication and sustainable development. Our opinion notes the recent report by UNCTAD and others that demonstrates that unfettered and extensive trade liberalisation does not necessarily translate into significant poverty eradication, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. I quote from the UNCTAD 2004 report on least-developed countries, which says: ‘The emerging post-liberal trends do not indicate that substantial and sustained poverty reduction will occur. On balance, future poverty reduction seems to have worsened’. So our first point in this opinion is to ask the Commission and Council to note that analysis and to modify trade policy accordingly. The first place they could apply that reformed trade policy is on the EU proposals for economic partnership agreements, because again increasing evidence suggests that if economic partnership agreements are to become genuine instruments of development, they have to offer non-reciprocal market access for as long as developing countries require it. I welcome recent statements from my own government in the UK that appear to guarantee poorest countries as much time as they need before acquiring that reciprocity. I urge the Council to adopt that position but warn that it will not be credible unless Article 24 of the GATT is revised accordingly as well. Finally we call on the Council and Commission to address the almost forgotten issue of commodity prices, which is strangely absent from the WTO agenda. According to Oxfam, developing countries would have earned USD 243 billion more in 2002 if the real prices of ten key commodities had remained at their 1980 levels. That is almost five times the world’s annual aid budget. We desperately need urgent action on this issue if we are to have any chance of meeting the MDG goals.

 Mr President, I have listened very carefully to the Commission and Council and find it extraordinary that neither has mentioned the fact that two EU Member States possess nuclear arsenals, and that this undermines the moral authority of the whole
 of the EU in the debate on nuclear disarmament. The overwhelming hypocrisy of the government of my own country, the UK, and of the US, in demanding that others disarm while they simultaneously upgrade their own nuclear capacity, is completely unacceptable. The NPT Treaty is a bargain, with non-nuclear states agreeing not to acquire nuclear weapons and existing nuclear states agreeing in return to begin a process of disarmament. Since we have failed to keep our side of the bargain, we cannot be surprised if other countries ignore our pleas for their disarmament. At the same time, we are running enormous risks of nuclear materials falling into the hands of non-state actors. The position of the UK Government is sadly both reckless and irresponsible, and it is also illegal. We have heard a lot about international law recently, so I would remind both Britain and France that, according to the ICJ in The Hague, nuclear weapons are not only immoral but also illegal. Britain and France should lead by example and unilaterally dismantle their illegal nuclear warheads, and the EU and its Member States must present an action plan and timetable for achieving a nuclear-free Europe.

 Mr President, I think Commissioner Kyprianou has a difficult task in front of him in trying to persuade us that the November Council compromise is a genuinely positive step forward when it comes to live animal exports. We know it is not, and I think you know it is not, Commissioner. It is a great shame that the Council is not here to be held to account. I have to say as well that I am disappointed that my own government voted in favour of this shabby deal; because a few technical improvements are now completely overshadowed by the failure to make any progress on journey times and stocking density. As a result, it seems this shockingly cruel practice will continue for many years to come. I notice, however, that you explicitly reserve the right to bring forward better proposals. I welcome that, and strongly urge you to do it as soon as possible, and in particular to introduce a maximum eight-hour journey time for both slaughter and further fattening animals. You can be sure that Parliament will be an ally on this, even more so if we have codecision. It is crucial that we send out a strong signal to all Member State governments that support for live exports is unacceptable in a civilised society.

 Mr President, I would like to raise the situation of one of my constituents, John Packwood from the Isle of Wight, who, as a result of an international arrest warrant taken out against him by the Moroccan authorities, is currently being held in prison in Madrid. Mr Packwood, along with three colleagues, delivered a privately-owned boat from the UK to Morocco back in 1997. The boat was fully searched on its arrival, given a clean bill of health and the four men went home. A full ten weeks later several tons of cocaine were found on board the vessel. Interpol interviewed the men and was completely satisfied that they were not implicated in any criminal activity. The first the men knew of the international arrest warrant was last month – over seven years later – when John Packwood was arrested as he passed through Malaga airport. He is now in prison in Madrid and that is completely unacceptable. I would ask the President of Parliament to intervene with the Moroccan authorities to raise these concerns and ask that these arrest warrants be lifted. The international NGO, Fair Trials Abroad, has agreed that this appears to be a blatant abuse of the international arrest warrant, since it is quite clear that the men could not have been involved in any smuggling operation.

 Mr President, I should like to add my thanks to Commissioner Wallström for all her work as Environment Commissioner. I know we are going to miss her very much and would like to extend our thanks to her. I should also like to thank Mrs Corbey for her report. This is a very important subject, which makes a real difference to our environment. It is an issue that constituents feel extremely strongly about. There are two key issues in Mrs Corbey's report. Firstly the dates. I understand very well why the rapporteur is proposing slightly later dates than the Commission. Our Group, the Verts/ALE, can 
certainly go along with that, with the proviso that we believe we need to be very careful that these compliance time gaps between older and newer Member States begin to start closing afterwards. As we have seen before, these gaps have in some cases actually got wider over time, so we need to make sure that over time they begin to close. On balance, however, we can accept the amendment. Another key issue is Amendment 4, to which many other speakers have referred. We have great sympathy with what Mrs Corbey is trying to achieve with this amendment. The rapporteur is trying to safeguard Dutch national provisions on re-usable packaging. I would point out that at first reading, Green amendments were aimed specifically at enabling national re-use schemes to proceed, but on that occasion we unfortunately did not secure a big enough majority to get that through. The Greens strongly support re-use as an important way to reduce the environmental impact of packaging, but we share the reservations expressed by others about trying to tackle that in this directive by amending a recital. We appreciate the motivation, but we do not think this is the right place to do that. We are not sure anyway how an amendment will support the Dutch case, since it does not amend the current legislation. We are not convinced that this recital would have an impact on the Netherlands, since this legislation appears to be much more applicable to the ten new Member States than to the 'old' Member States. Even if it were applicable, I am not sure how much further forward it would take us. The main difference between what we already have in Directive 94/62/EC on re-use and what the rapporteur would like to introduce is a slight reinforcement of the level of encouragement to re-use. But given that the amendment is just to a recital, I do not see how it really strengthens the existing legal possibility. I strongly urge that we use all our efforts to promote re-use over recycling and recovery when we come to the full review of the packaging directive next year. I look forward to a strong Commission proposal next summer. That will be the right time to ensure that we give re-use the priority it deserves.

 Mr President, I am delighted we are having this debate, as it is a crucial environmental issue, which is already of great concern to many people. These new, much more powerful sonars – one of the loudest sound systems ever devised – have sparked an epidemic of strandings, internal bleeding, deafness and lung damage wherever they have been tested. A single blast of the new technology can affect animals across 3.8 million km2 of water. That is why it is simply not good enough that the Commission responded to a written question of mine last November, simply saying that this type of technology needs to be used with caution. This type of technology cannot
 be used with caution because of the huge impact it has. At one hundred miles away from the source of the sound, the noise can still cause shearing of the tissues in the air sack behind whales' and dolphins brains. I listened with great interest to the Commissioner's introduction, and I heard a lot about more research but nothing about calling for a moratorium. In July, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission unanimously issued a strong statement of concern about intense underwater noise, citing what it
 calls compelling evidence that entire populations of whales and other marine mammals are potentially threatened by it. So do not tell us that we need more research before we call for a moratorium – we do not: there is plenty of evidence that we need to act. I would strongly urge Members to vote against the amendment tabled by the PPE Group, which seeks to weaken the resolution by calling upon Member States to adopt geographic restrictions in sensitive marine habitats. There is simply no scientific justification for this amendment. Mrs Korhola gave a very nice speech – it is a pity she has now left the Chamber – but she did not explain why she has put her name to this very same amendment, which would gut and weaken the very resolution which she claims to support. Given that a single blast of this low-frequency technology can affect animals across 3.8 million km2 of water and that little is known about their migratory patterns, geographic restrictions are not appropriate. They will not work. I urge colleagues to reject that amendment.

 Mr President, I welcome the plans for serious revision of the GSP, which is long overdue. I also welcome the Council's recent conclusions, which very clearly demand meaningful consultation with the European Parliament. It is a matter of regret that the Commission's Communication was not the result of a full stakeholder consultation and did not appear sufficiently in advance to allow for meaningful consultation before the release of the next regulation. It is vital that Parliament and all other interested stakeholders have a proper opportunity to input into this very important process, and I am glad that Commissioner Lamy has agreed to that. In terms of substance, it is clear that the GSP urgently needs to be simplified since it is clearly not working properly. The rules of origin requirements are far too strict, with the result that a large proportion of developing-country exports to the EU fail to gain preferential access because they are deemed to be non-originating. One of the justifications for strict rules of origin is that they should promote so-called backward linkages, i.e. the production of intermediate goods in developing countries themselves. Yet the experience of this clearly demonstrates that rules of origin are not an appropriate instrument to achieve that goal. In fact, most developing countries are small, with little capacity to develop a full supply chain. Sri Lanka is a classic example, having developed a thriving garment sector but still not having the capacity to supply textiles to support that industry. It relies essentially on an indirect instrument of trade policy to foster a supply response in developing countries that is likely to be much less efficient and much more vulnerable to abuse than straightforward financial incentives or technical assistance or infrastructure provision for the industries concerned. I am pleased that Mr Lamy says that we are going to have some real action on rules of origin. The Commission should be looking at far-reaching proposals, such as proposals that would in general allow a least-developed country export to qualify for duty-free access to the EU if at least 40% of a good's value is added in a least-developed country that is not necessarily the final country of export. In the case of textiles and clothing, we clearly need to go even further, because some of the poorest countries will face enormous shocks when the Multifibre Agreement is withdrawn. Organisations like Oxfam have made some very detailed proposals in this area. My last point relates to textiles again. When the MFA is withdrawn, some of the poorest countries will face major problems. I would suggest that developing countries which are highly dependent on textiles and clothing, but are not necessarily classified as least-developed countries, should be exempted temporarily from the existing rules of origin requirements. This applies particularly to countries that obtain more than 50% of their current export revenue from textiles and clothing. I would be very interested in the views of the Commission and Council on that proposal.
