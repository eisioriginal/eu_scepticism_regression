 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that we can end the current Parliamentary term with the final adoption of the last of the maritime packages. I remember, however, that when I first came to the European Parliament in 1999, we had a serious maritime accident off the French coast with the Erika
, which gave its name to the first set of legislative proposals designed to avert and prevent accidents. We thought we had warded off the danger, but soon afterwards, the coastline of Galicia was ruined by the tar from an even worse accident than the previous one: the Prestige
. Since then, we in the Committee on Transport and Tourism have worked on a succession of legislative packages in an attempt to overcome the excessive resistance we have encountered among shipowners, oil companies, classification societies and also certain Member States, which rejected the three proposals for being too stringent. Over the last 10 years, we have adopted a number of directives and regulations, some of which we have had to go back and revise because they proved ineffective in their initial versions, as a result of the cuts made by the Council. We adopted legislation to introduce double-hulled vessels, a European fund for major oil disasters, and ports of refuge, and now we are revising and adopting legislation on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea, the investigation of maritime accidents, the Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system, port state control and, lastly, the regulation and directives on ship inspection and survey organisations. All this is good and it is desirable that it should enter into force and be implemented by all the Member States as soon as possible. I am pleased at that. However, this Parliament’s term is coming to an end. I am leaving Parliament, and I am going with the regret that we have not succeeded in making it compulsory to introduce control systems – which already exist and have been patented – to show when and what amounts of bilge and oil tank residues have been illegally dumped into the sea by a particular vessel. In other words, they are a kind of black box or tachometer that can be inspected by the maritime authorities whenever a vessel enters port. I believe we owe the marine environment greater attention and stricter procedures to avert all the pollution we cause. I also think that, if we fail in this, it will affect our food chain and our lives, and we will end up paying a high price for it. I trust it will not take another 10 years to control illegal discharges at sea more effectively and efficiently.

 Mr President, unlike many others, the car industry does not work on the basis of speculation but rather operates on fine margins that only turn into profit if many units are sold. Of course cars are a significant source of greenhouse gases, but it is also true that the industry, in conjunction with its support industries, is responsible for 10% of European GDP and provides 12 million jobs representing 6% of employment in the Union. For this reason it is a very important sector for the well-being of our citizens. We cannot abandon it to its fate and to the hard and fast rules of supply and demand; these are the very reasons why we now have this crisis in the financial sector and consequently in all other sectors, including the car industry. We must look for support solutions that respect the principle of free competition in the European Union and which offer the necessary aid to save this manufacturing sector. For this we need a European framework to ensure harmonisation across all Member States. Multi-million-dollar aid has already been approved in the United States and other places. Furthermore, some countries have adjusted their exchange rates and introduced other mechanisms to become competitive in our markets. We must therefore not be concerned with what the rest of the world says, but rather adopt the necessary measures without further delay.

 Mr President, in the EU there are several cases of languages spoken by historical European groups which cannot be used in debates in this Parliament since they are not recognised as state languages. This is a loss to representative democracy. One of these cases is the Basque language, Euskera, which is not a minority language but an official one, at least in the southern area of the Basque Country, which, in administrative terms, is classed as part of the Spanish state. However, the same is not true – and please do not take this personally, Commissioner – in the northern part of the Basque Country, which is attached to the French state, whose President stated to the United Nations Assembly that to deny respect for national identities and languages is to sow the seeds of humiliation and that, without that respect, there will not be peace in the world. For all that, neither Euskera nor Corsican, Breton or Occitan are given the slightest official consideration, nor are they given support to ensure their use is respected and encouraged. That is why I ask the Agency for Fundamental Rights to keep watch and to work to ensure that within Member States, there is no violation of any European people’s right to use its mother tongue and no discrimination against its citizens, and that all native languages are considered official within their respective territories.

 Municipal elections were held in Nicaragua on 9 November this year. As on previous occasions, the electoral process has been called into question in terms of its democratic legitimacy. Accusations of fraud have been made, and demonstrations have taken place with clashes between supporters of different political parties. Many people have been injured, and the political crisis in which the country is immersed is getting deeper. Two political parties were unable to put up candidates for the local elections. That is unacceptable, because it curtails the fundamental right of all citizens to political participation. Moreover, we have received direct statements from representatives of human rights organisations telling us about the mood in civil society to question the judicial system, about the administrative repression mechanisms that have brought up to 17 social movement organisations before the courts, and about the persecution of independent journalists and even the delegation from the European Commission. For all these reasons we must raise our voices and call firstly on the political parties to condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by their followers, and secondly on the government itself to reopen spaces for democratic participation, to respect freedom of expression, to stop banning marches, and to allow all NGOs to receive international cooperation aid and not only aid from Venezuela for pro-government associations. In addition, they should revoke the criminalisation of therapeutic abortion in cases where the mother’s life is threatened. Finally, in the context of the negotiations on the association agreement between Central America and the EU, we call on the Commission to remind Nicaragua that it must respect the principles of the rule of law, democracy and human rights. That, however, must not prevent Europe from continuing to provide aid for the development and welfare of the Nicaraguan people, because we want them to have the best possible future.

 Mrs Wallström, do you believe that the issue of whether electors feel close to or distant from candidates has an impact on the level of participation in European elections? Do you agree with a State of 45 million inhabitants having only one electoral district for the European Parliament elections? What can the Commission do to ensure that States with a larger population have electoral districts which are closer to the people?

 Regrettably, for reasons beyond my control, I could not take part in yesterday’s debate on this directive on ship inspection and survey organisations. I want to take advantage of this opportunity to express my satisfaction that this directive has been adopted by Parliament with the recommendations of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. There were a couple of aspects that were not clear enough or properly dealt with in the common position adopted by the Council. The first was that ship classification societies, when acting on behalf of national administrations – because it is the responsibility of flag States to guarantee the safety of ships – must be covered by the same legal guarantees as when it is the national administrations that are acting. Secondly, I believe we have properly clarified the financial liabilities in the event of an incident. The Council common position did not clearly distinguish between the three possible cases – where these incidents cause the deaths of people, where they cause personal injury or where they simply cause property damage – so Parliament has sorted this out and ensured that it is clarified. I hope this will be accepted by the Council.

 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, European citizens cannot understand why, in the age of technology, telecommunications, satellites, etc., we are experiencing incidents of piracy that appear to be transporting us back four or five centuries in our history. I cannot accept what others have been saying in terms of being satisfied with the response. For several years I have been saying here in the European Parliament that the situation in the Indian Ocean, the situation off the coast of Somalia for European fishermen and for vessels that operate and work there is unsustainable, and there has not been a great deal of response. I do indeed welcome the fact that finally the Council has taken a first step, which I think is an insufficient one, by creating this cell in Brussels that is going to be responsible for accompanying fishermen, protecting humanitarian aid, which is so necessary in Somalia, and also securing agreements on fishing grounds. I think that with what has been created and agreed so far, it is not going to be possible to achieve all of these ambitious objectives. The sea is very big, as is the coastline of the Indian Ocean, and we need the contribution and cooperation of all European countries, because the question is not whether the fishermen or vessels are French, Basque, Spanish, or Dutch; the question is that they are European and that we all need to contribute to this together.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, along around one hundred thousand kilometres of coast in the united Europe, we have more than one thousand two hundred merchant ports, as well as several hundred more dotted along the thirty-six thousand kilometres of internal waterways. 90% of our international trade passes through them, as well as 40% of the tonnes per kilometre of intra-Community trade. Ports generate half a million jobs and guarantee the development of entire regions. They are also key for the regular passenger and ferry services, which provide social cohesion for the islands and other territories that are more easily and more sustainably reached by sea. There is therefore no doubt that we are talking about a sector that is of great importance for our well-being. Nevertheless, our ports are facing major challenges, including the increase in international demand for transport, which is increasing even faster than the rate of global economic growth. In this context it is worth mentioning the advances in navigation technologies, logistical telecommunications and exploitation, the commitment to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases, securing new investment and the need to bring training up to date for the staff that manage and deal with these aspects. However, ports also have the challenge of maintaining dialogue and coordinated action with their respective surrounding areas, neighbours, cities and regions, and to develop the best possible connections and convenience in relation to other modes of transport, for their mutual benefit and in order to seek the most harmonious and sustainable planning solutions. The ports are also part of our internal market, and they therefore have to comply with the relevant Community parameters. The Committee on Transport and Tourism, which appointed me as rapporteur for this matter, wished to produce an own-initiative report, which, having been debated and agreed by the various groups is now being put before the plenary sitting of the European Parliament. In our analysis we considered that the European ports policy should aim to promote competitiveness in maritime transport and the provision of high-quality, modern services, promoting safety, fast services, low costs and respect for the environment, creating a European maritime transport space without barriers. We believe that technological and economic progress and the widening of the Panama Canal will accentuate the current trend towards larger vessels, and will bring about changes in the international routes. We also believe that at the same time, in Europe, where there are not many ports that are deep enough to allow large vessels to operate there, there will be development of intermediate ports and also small and medium-sized ports, thus boosting cabotage and river transport. For this future we need an integrated European policy to boost regional competitiveness and territorial cohesion, and efforts need to be redoubled to reduce water pollution and CO2 
emissions, therefore we are asking for the current fuel to be replaced by diesel by 2020. We need the port authorities to cooperate with each other and with the local and regional authorities and transport sector associations, not only maritime and river transport, but also rail, air and road transport. We consider that the legal certainty of the Community legal framework in the maritime field, flowing from the international legal framework, depends on the speedy approval of the Erika III maritime package, and we ask for this to be done with the greatest of urgency and the greatest possible consensus. European ports are sometimes in competition with ports in third countries that have discriminatory policies; we therefore need a list of bottlenecks. We understand that technological changes will have major financial implications, and that therefore the regions should also be able to use the structural funds in order to finance the acquisition of advanced technological installations, create jobs in innovative fields and rehabilitate urban areas freed up by the transfer of port facilities. We are in communication with the Commission in order for it to publish guidelines for State aid to ports in 2008, distinguishing between access and defence infrastructures, which should be exempt, and project-related infrastructure and superstructure, and so that aid for environmental improvements or decongestions and reducing the use of roads should not be considered as State aid, or when it is essential, as in the case of islands, in order to ensure cohesion. We approve the extension of the transparency requirements in this respect, but instead of an absolute obligation we ask for ports that do not reach a reduced minimum threshold for annual revenue to be exempted. Finally, we support port workers being provided with a recognisable qualification and we ask the European social dialogue committee to address these issues.

 Mr President, I would like to add to my earlier comments by urging the Commission to promote the exchange and dissemination of good practice in the port sector in general and with regard to innovation and the training of workers in particular in order to improve the quality of services, competitiveness of the ports and the attraction of investment. We welcome the fact there is to be a European Maritime Day on 20 May each year, with an open day to help the public gain a better understanding of the work and importance of the port sector for our lives and our well-being. We urge the operators to reduce the number of empty containers transported and the Commission to promote a single harmonised transport document for all European Union containers, also simplifying customs procedures for goods that have come from or are going to destinations within the Community to the same level as for road, rail or air transport. We also urge the Commission to continue its efforts to ensure that the United States regulation which plans to scan all of the containers that we send there is changed, and replaced by cooperation based on the mutual recognition of authorised economic operators and of security standards agreed by the World Customs Organisation. To conclude, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, all of my colleagues who have spoken and the secretariats of the Committees on Transport and Regional Development for their help and significant contribution to the final result of this report, as well as staff in the Commission and Directorate B of the Directorate General for Internal Policies of the Union, who produced an excellent report for us on this subject. Thank you to everyone, and I hope that tomorrow we will have support to move forward with this important report.

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I know you are familiar with what are known as ‘futures’ in finance markets and stock markets. There has also been much talk of the effect of diverting agricultural produce to the production of biofuels as one of the main reasons for the increase in food prices. I wish to ask whether a study has been made by the Presidency and the Council on the volume of futures in connection with food markets and hydrocarbon markets, and the extent to which this may be indiscriminately raising prices.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that there is a need to adopt measures to eliminate destructive fishing practices that threaten vulnerable marine ecosystems. With this in mind we agree with the idea that Union vessels that operate in deep-sea areas that are not subject to any regional fisheries organisation or agreement should be subject to Community regulations governing the conditions that they must fulfil in order to obtain the relevant special permits at these depths, and specifying the subsequent conduct that they must observe, the information they must provide, etc. We do not, however, agree with the restrictions that the Commission was proposing in Article 6, setting as a reasonable option a maximum depth of 1 000 metres for the deployment of bottom gears, as it considers that this limit offers an appropriate level of protection, because there is no established data to back this up. There are no scientific studies that show whether vulnerable ecosystems are below or above those 1 000 metre levels. We think that we need to move forward and better document the seabed in each area, identifying where the vulnerabilities are, before indicating any maximum depth for deployment. We think that it would be a good idea that, if a vessel happened to come across a possible vulnerable marine ecosystem, it should be obliged to stop fishing and inform the appropriate authorities. With this in mind, we agree with the proposal that a representative sample of the vessels to which each Member State has issued a special fishing permit should take a scientific observer on board, ensuring a suitable rotation among all vessels for successive fishing trips. Finally, we also agree that, in the event of a technical problem with the satellite positioning device that each vessel must carry, the captain should communicate the vessel’s geographical location at 2-hour intervals and that, when it returns to port, it should not be able to return to sea until it can be verified that the positioning system is functioning correctly. All of this is being proposed not only with the aim of greater sustainability of the marine environment, but also in order to safeguard the fishing activities that are necessary in order to provide us with food.

 Mr President, a community such as the Latin-Caribbean community, whose entire population on the American continent resembles our own, whom we can speak to in its own languages – Portuguese, French and Spanish, among others – merits special consideration and treatment by the European institutions. In additional to historical links, we share Christian roots, principles, values and many interests, and so we must continue to elaborate on the bi-regional strategic association already announced at the four Summits of Heads of State and Government preceding the Lima Summit we are discussing today. This means we can continue to propitiate social, cultural and political rapprochement between our societies, and also in terms of trade, economics, security and the fight against climate change and in favour of sustainable development. I agree we ought to give this association a full strategic perspective, which, on the heels of those already in place with Mexico and Chile, should lead as soon as possible to negotiations with Mercosur, the Andean Community and Central America and, on the basis of a multicultural vision, allow us to create a global interregional EuroLat zone as a WTO-compatible model envisaging freedom of movement of persons and free commercial and regional trade facilities. To this end, Europe must make its contribution to the diversification and modernisation of production processes in Latin America with plans for technology transfer and capacity-building, creating the best possible context for investment within a comparable framework of legal certainty, towards Latin American integration and, as the culmination of all this, the eradication of poverty, inequality and exclusion. We must make intelligent use of the Community funding instruments relating to development cooperation, promotion of democracy and human rights and other programmes in relation to training, education, scientific and technical cooperation, health, emigration, etc. We ought to create a bi-regional solidarity fund, a conflict prevention centre, a foundation to encourage dialogue, an emigration observatory, and immediately add Mercosur to the EuroLat Parliamentary Assembly. The future will not wait, Mr President, and uniting both sides of the Atlantic is the West’s challenge in the context of globalisation and the 21st
 century.

Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, a dynamic and healthy financial sector is crucial for the stability of the European economy and for global competitiveness. This is vitally important for consumers and companies. With this in mind, we all agree on the need for financial institutions to be well managed and supervised. That is why in 2001 we launched what is known as the Lamfalussy Process, with the aim of putting in place an efficient mechanism for convergence between the various Member States and partners in terms of supervisory practice and financial regulation. Now the Commission is asking us to approve a series of new initiatives relating to the adoption of legislation, the convergence of supervision and the strengthening of cooperation between the supervisory bodies in the various Member States. We agree with all of this because we need a strong and healthy financial sector that is capable of supporting our economy in the face of the turbulence on the international markets, but we want even more. We want the Savings Directive, which has been in force since 2005, to be examined in order to put an end to scandals such as Liechtenstein, which appears to be hiding tax evaders. There should not be Member States, linked territories or countries associated with the European Economic Area that, under the protection of banking secrecy, do not exchange information on interest paid to residents of other members of that same common economic space. Free competition prohibits State aid as a way of promoting the private economy; and taxation of savings should not be a gateway for distorting equal competition. The rules of the game should be the same for everyone and we should therefore eradicate tax havens, as they are anti-competitive and also anti-social.

Commissioner, I assume that you know that in some States there is a method for paying authors’ rights that involves establishing a charge that must be paid by all those who buy equipment to record or reproduce material, or buy CDs or DVDs. I wanted to ask you whether you think that this method is acceptable, when there are many people who buy such equipment or DVDs and do not use them either to download music or to reproduce anything that affects authors’ rights. I think that this method is punishing honest citizens. I would like to know your opinion on this.

In the meantime, the United States, for example, has concluded free trade agreements with various South American countries.

 Madam President, health services form a recurring topic in European Parliament debates. Each time we discuss the Services Directive there is a bid to include them in it, a bid which we have hitherto opposed, and health services have remained outside its scope. The supply of medication is a health service. There are some States, such as the Spanish State, which have an established group of sites – pharmacies – which are the only places where medicines may be dispensed. I would like to ask the Commissioner whether, as part of the investigation carried out by the Commission, any differences have been noted between States where pharmacies are a restricted, monitored trade and the others, with regard to the counterfeiting of medicines and inferior quality.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, as a result of globalisation, our economy, the progress of the Community and the welfare of our citizens depend more than ever on an effective, efficient, economic and, above all, sustainable system of transport. All modes of transport are needed. The railways enjoyed glory days in the beginning, but were then pushed aside by vehicles travelling on roads and motorways, due to their greater versatility, individuality and accessibility. Now, with our roads at risk of collapse and our environment in a critical state due to pollution, we are once again looking at the railways as a hope for the future to meet our needs for domestic mobility. Aware of this, the Commission has proposed a new legislative package to improve the technical part of the regulatory framework for rail transport. This involves revising the directives on interoperability and safety and the Regulation on the European Railway Agency. In general terms, it was years ago that the European institutions first considered the need to consolidate the railways at Community level. Just on the issue of interoperability, everyone knows that, in July 1996, in other words 11 years ago, we adopted Council Directive 96/48/EC on the high-speed rail system followed, in March 2001, by the Directive on the trans-European conventional rail system. However, for more than a decade, the levels of interoperability of the European networks have not gone beyond 7% and it is the requirement for national approval of locomotives and traction units in each of the Member States where these are to be used that is currently one of the main barriers to the creation of new railway companies dedicated to the transport of passengers and freight, and also a major obstacle to the interoperability of the European railway system. As Member States cannot decide on their own that their authorisations for placing in service will be valid on the territory of other Member States, a Community initiative to simplify and harmonise national procedures and to encourage more systematic use of the principle of mutual recognition is necessary. The current directives regulate only new rolling stock placed in service. The new directive is intended to consolidate, recast and merge the current directives. For our part, based on brief technical reports that we requested in accordance with Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, we have proposed transferring to our Interoperability Directive the contents of the former Article 14 of the Safety Directive. This is specifically intended to give the rail sector greater legal certainty and enable the simplification of the authorisation for placing in service. We agree with the condition of there being at least one authorisation issued by one Member State for each vehicle. This authorisation will stem from compliance with the ‘EC’ declaration and with the applicable technical specifications on interoperability. Member States will consider as meeting the essential technical requirements those structural subsystems authorised to be placed into service in any other Member State and will not require any further authorisation, except where compatibility with infrastructure characteristics or limitations may be affected. In our report, we wanted to structure the various aspects and sections of the directive in a way more easily understandable to those concerned, by devoting a specific chapter to the requirements for placing vehicles into service, depending on whether this involves first or second authorisations or vehicles meeting all the TSIs (Technical Specifications of Interoperability) or only some of these. On all the aspects mentioned and throughout the whole procedure, we have remained in periodic contact with the shadow rapporteurs of the various political groups, the Commission and also the Council Presidency. We have finally been able to reach agreement, having resolved an important issue which was the maximum time limits for deciding on an authorisation, thus eradicating the well-known and paralysing administrative silence due to a lack of decision. Following a great deal of effort, we have agreed that authorisation will be automatic in the absence of a decision and we have also agreed on the rest of the articles. On behalf of this Parliament, we have therefore tabled a joint amendment, signed by all the parliamentary groups, which contains the same text that will be presented to the Council of Transport Ministers. I hope that the fact of having reached agreement at first reading will be beneficial to the whole sector. I want to end by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs for their help and cooperation in achieving this objective.

I was the first MEP who raised a hand to ask for the floor, the first, and now I am condemned to be last, or among the last, and not to speak for more than a minute. Having said that, I would like to congratulate the Commissioner and the Commission, both for this Communication and for all the work that they have been doing for a year in consulting the parties concerned, in an attempt to develop an integrated maritime policy for the whole of the European Union, taking into account the importance of the marine environment and the attacks that it constantly suffers due to human activity. In this respect, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether the military sector, whose activities sometimes interfere with and affect the marine environment, is going to be taken into consideration in Community policy in this field in order to prevent encroachment on the environment. In addition, there is the uncontrolled dumping that is constantly taking place. When are black boxes going to be introduced in order to monitor all movements of liquids in the bilges and in the liquid in the tanks of the vessels?

Unlike the Commission, the Council and the Committee of the Regions, where the people’s representatives may express themselves in these coofficial languages, the Bureau refuses to accept Basque, Catalan or Gallego, which are coofficial languages in the Spanish state.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I agree that Galileo is an urgent priority project for the EU, but farmers are extremely concerned because the Commission has come up with the idea of using surplus CAP funds to finance the Galileo project. Since 2007 did apparently produce a surplus, they are worried about their future. My question for the Council is this: do the various governments, the 27 EU governments, agree that this ought to be a priority project and that funds should be applied either by means of extraordinary contributions or by using funds left over every year from the Community budget?

 Mr President, I now wish to speak on behalf of Mr Navarro, and then ask a question of my own, or rather repeat a question. My question on behalf of Mr Navarro is as follows: Article 23(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, which provide for the establishment of a bluefin tuna recovery plan, allows any surpluses produced by a Member State with respect to the yearly quota to be deducted from future fishing possibilities. What I wish to ask the Council is: what will happen to those who have caught less than their quota this year, since the Commission closed the fishing grounds last week?

 Mr President, I also wish to beg your indulgence to ask the Presidency of the Council how Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 can be applied if the Member States have failed to cooperate with the Commission by not sending it the compulsory documentation on catches during this fishing year.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am one of those people who believe that progress and welfare cannot be attained without ambitious objectives, but I also believe that we in the Community and the European Union have on too many occasions given ourselves grandiloquent and unrealistic agreements and objectives. This is what I believe happened in 2000 with the Lisbon Strategy, which was going to make us the most competitive and dynamic world economy by 2010; or in 1994 with the Essen Agreements on trans-European networks, most of which are still pending. In March this very year, the European Council set a target for a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, whereas in reality we have proved incapable of attaining the much more modest targets to which we committed ourselves in Kyoto. Now we are debating freight transport logistics in Europe as a key to sustainable mobility, a crucial element for our growth and development; and given the significant growth in freight transport predicted by 2020, logistics is something we cannot ignore as it is a necessary tool to increase the accessibility, efficiency and security of freight transport, as well as its sustainability. However, at the same time it is necessary to correct persistent failures such as the bottleneck in the trans-European road network in the Biriatu Pass in the Basque Country, or other aspects where there are shortcomings such as the lack of corridors currently devoted to rail freight (such corridors do not need to be high-speed in order to be competitive), or the poor interoperability of the railways, or the lack of efficient transhipment. We must make intelligent transport systems possible, apply the potential offered by the Internet to the management of freight transport by standardising weights, dimensions and rules governing freight, reducing red-tape and establishing one-stop access points. We must promote co-modality of the various modes of transport, not forgetting motorways of the sea and inland waterways; most of all we must incorporate the real costs, including environmental costs, into the price of use. All this cannot be achieved while reducing States’ contributions to the Community budget.

Madam President, just this morning – an amazing coincidence given this debate on maritime policy! – I read a press article saying that human begins originate from water, that we cannot live without it and that 75% of an adult human being is made up of nothing but water. Furthermore, three-quarters of the Earth’s surface is covered with the water of our seas and oceans and there is a constant cycle of transfers of water from the oceans to the atmosphere, from the atmosphere to the Earth, and finally it returns to the sea via the rivers. We therefore have a duty to pay the greatest possible attention to the sustainability of the marine environment, particularly given that for some time alarm bells have been ringing throughout the world with regard to the deterioration of the environment, in general, and climate change in particular. We believe that in all institutions — both Community institutions and State, regional and local institutions — and also in the private field, measures that improve water quality must be adopted quickly. In this regard, we wish to express our concern at the long timetable that appears in the proposal for a directive on a marine strategy. We believe that, just like when we talk about atmospheric pollution and the hole in the ozone layer, we do not have much time left to act and reverse the current trend. Unless we do so as soon as possible, I fear that the damage will be irreversible. We have therefore proposed that the timetable for drawing up the action plans within the new marine strategy be adapted urgently, bringing them into line with other important Union programmes, such as those funded by FEDER, the Cohesion Fund and also the agricultural policy, since there are also agricultural activities that lead to waste being dumped in the sea. We also believe that we need more accurate information concerning what happens in the seas and oceans. We are in favour of better coordination and connection amongst all of the European marine research institutes, promoting either a network or a European consortium and creating a maritime database that is accessible to all of them. We must improve training and information at all levels and disseminate best practices in relation to control and pollution. With regard to this aspect, I would insist once again on something that I have been saying for years, which is that we need to make it obligatory to install devices in ships – devices that have already been invented – for controlling the emptying and cleaning of tanks and bilge, in the form of black boxes that cannot be tampered with, which will be the best method for preventing deliberate dumping, though I still believe that this must be complemented with satellite monitoring and inspection. We must not forget about the professional fishermen, who represent a significant group of the population whose way of life must be safeguarded for the future, preventing coastal and island areas from becoming depopulated or invaded by uncontrolled development. Finally, we propose that the ‘polluter pays’ principle also be applied to the marine sector and that a Community fund be created for the repopulation and conservation of marine flora and fauna, based on contributions from all industrial, energy, tourist, leisure and all other kinds of activities that pollute our seas.

Madam President, amongst other things, we are debating the fourth review of the Directive on ship inspection and survey organisations and the relevant activities of maritime administrations on behalf of flag States. The previous review, which was the third, formed part of the first legislative package intended to put an end to the irresponsible conduct in maritime transport that has led to tragic accidents, such as the one involving the Erika
, which had such a serious impact on our environment and on our coasts. In this new proposal, the European Commission is seriously considering whether the system of classification and inspection as a whole makes sufficient efforts to achieve the required levels of quality. As rapporteur for the third review, I must respond by saying that sufficient efforts are not really being made. Not only is the maritime sector to blame, however, but also the fact that certain Member States – which are ultimately responsible – and some MEPs, did not want to do more. I remember how the majority of the amendments that I proposed in my report, in a quest for more requirements and control in inspections, were rejected. At that time I expressed my disappointment and my conviction that that review would not improve things. Unfortunately I was right and we saw the tragic episode of the Prestige
 accident, which once again called into question the most recent inspection to have been carried out on that ship and its insufficient compliance with the recommendations resulting from that inspection. We are now once again amending the Directive on the organisations recognised for the carrying out of inspections of ships and, although I do not like the fact that those organisations can form part of the committee responsible for assessment, since that could affect their independence, I must acknowledge that the changes agreed in the Committee on Transport and Tourism substantially and positively improve it. For example, the prohibition of changing the class of ships without the aforementioned organisation passing the information on its inspections on to the new classification organisation, or the States’ monitoring of the recognised organisation and the control of the effectiveness of their inspection standards and rules by the European Commission, and also the mutual recognition of those rules amongst the different recognised organisations in accordance with stricter and more rigorous models. I trust that all of these amendments will be approved by the plenary of the European Parliament, because they will mean that our seas and our environment face less risk and that will benefit all of us. I regret that I cannot agree with everything Mr de Grandes Pascual – who is not currently in the Chamber – has said, but I do not share his opinion. I believe that the decision to move the Prestige
 away from the Galician coast was prejudicial and that the consequences we suffered were worse than they would have been had it been taken to a port of refuge. I would nevertheless like to congratulate Mr de Grandes Pascual on his report, and all of the other Members who have spoken and who have been responsible for this third legislative package.

Mr President, Commissioner, we are living in the era of globalisation, which undoubtedly has its good points and its bad points, but which is fortunately enabling us to become aware of the great effects of human activity and development on the planet. Amongst other things, the marine environment, which provides us with so much in terms of food, leisure and transport, is constantly being polluted, by dumping from both land and sea. Of this pollution, some of it – the smallest proportion of it – results from unavoidable accidents, while the majority of it is caused by shipowners and operators who are still acting irresponsibly, ignoring international rules and safety practices. The specific cases of the Prestige
 and the Erika 
stood out, but we must not forget the pollution that is caused on a daily basis by the uncontrolled dumping of bilge and cleaning out of tanks. We are therefore obliged to employ all of the controls and resources available to us in order to put a stop to this criminal behaviour, and we must demand that all flag States fulfil their responsibilities, that they have properly qualified and experienced inspectors, and that their port authorities inspect the condition of ships’ hulls and ensure compliance with the rules on the dumping of waste. Finally, with regard to that last aspect, I would like to insist that the Commission propose legislation to oblige all ships to carry automatic devices for recording levels of liquid in bilge and tanks every hour, in the manner of black boxes like those carried by aircraft, to make it possible to detect crimes against the marine environment. This is the only way to achieve our objective. I would like to end by congratulating the rapporteurs on their wonderful work.

I would like to refer to the Community plan to eradicate illegal fishing, which, at international level, takes place above all in the waters of developing countries, which are too poor and lack the resources required to control fishing activities in the areas under their jurisdiction. The fact that this illegal fishing cannot be prevented leads to losses and poverty for their coastal populations that depend on fishing for a living and for a secure source of food. At the same time, these illegal practices lead to direct losses for legitimate fisheries operators as well. In this regard, I would like to stress once again that one of the virtues of the association agreements in the fisheries sector between the European Union and other countries is that Community deep-sea fishing fleets have accepted the code of conduct for responsible fishing, promoted by the United Nations, and that their presence in those waters also means that other illegal vessels do not act with such impunity. Therefore, being in favour of renewing all the fisheries agreements with third countries, since they offer significant mutual benefits for both parties, I have voted in favour of the plan to eradicate illegal fishing, because it poses a serious threat to the biological balance of the oceans, and that represents a great environmental risk that we cannot afford.

Mr President, I would like to express my support for the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Gabon, as well as the other similar agreements with other ACP countries (Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific) and with certain other States. These agreements are based on the principle of reciprocal cooperation and are in line with the partnership approach which is being applied to the external dimension of our common fisheries policy. By means of these agreements, we achieve a twin objective: firstly, we guarantee that the interests of the Union’s deep-sea fishing fleet are protected and, secondly, we improve the conditions with a view to achieving sustainable fisheries in the waters of the partner countries. In this regard, I would like to end by stressing that the Union  and our deep-sea fishing fleet, in contrast to others that operate illegally – has committed itself to ensuring that world fishing activities are sustainable and has accepted the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation’s Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. We must support this and other agreements, because they promote the development of our partner countries.

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many years ago we agreed to create a common European area characterised by free movement within its borders of persons, goods, capital and services, and we have unquestionably made progress over the years since then, but we still have a lot to do in order to make what we proposed a reality. One of the outstanding tasks is precisely the one we are discussing today: opening up passenger services by rail to the common European area. We are talking about a service that affects the citizens directly and we must therefore act prudently in order to prevent the achievement of our objective from creating so much harm that the expected benefits are no longer worthwhile. As in the case of other kinds of liberalisation, we must be careful and patient so that our decisions allow for a sufficient margin to adapt to the changes and do not have a negative effect on any basic public service. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is entirely in favour of opening up international services to the market, as the Commission proposed, as did the Council in its common position, but we also want other national services to be liberalised and for that to be included in this amendment of Directive 91/440/EEC that we are debating. With regard to this last aspect, we know that many people, including our French colleagues and others, fear that free competition may have a negative impact on the provision of the less profitable internal rail services. We share that concern and therefore, although we are going to vote in general for the Committee on Transport and Tourism’s amendments, we are going to vote in favour of Amendment 37 so that in 2012, on the basis of two years of experience in the liberalisation of international services, the Commission will present us with a report analysing, five years in advance, the state of preparation of the opening up of the market in passenger services within the States. We are also going to reject Amendment 18, because it seems to us to be reasonable to be able to limit for a maximum period of up to fifteen years the right of international services to cabotage when that means competing with another previous State concession awarded by means of a transparent and open public procedure. We are going to argue that the introduction of new international services that represent competition should not affect the economic viability of the current regional and local rail services, and also that rules could be established to be met by both State and international services and which will be intended to compensate for public service obligations. We also want to encourage private initiative to invest in the development of railways and, to that end, we propose that framework agreements on the award of rail services may last for fifteen years, and more in cases of large investments in specialised infrastructures that present an annual repayment plan that justify that exceptional duration. I would like to end by thanking the rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx and Mr Savary, for the work they have done.

Mr President, I would like to refer to the Directive on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles. I must begin by saying that I have voted in favour, because, as a whole, we have genuinely improved the safety aspects, the environmental aspects, the aspects relating to human health and also the aspects relating to the interests of European companies. I believe, however, that we have missed a good opportunity to establish a very clear distinction between fireworks, used in public celebrations or displays, in theatres, in cinema etc., and percussion pistons, which are used in toys, in airbags in vehicles and even in safety belts. I believe that our text is a little confusing in this regard. I hope that this can be improved in the future. For the time being, my vote is in favour, though I do not consider the text to be entirely satisfactory.

Mr President, the European Union’s fundamental motto is ‘United in diversity’. Since its origins we have been trying to build a common area, and not just an economic area but, above all, an area of life opportunities and freedom. We are doing so amongst people and nations that have many things in common; I am not just referring to the strategic, political and social interests that we share, but also to our values, habits and ways of looking at life. We have a common cultural background based on Greek thought, Roman law, Christianity, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the Renaissance and even globalisation. At the same time, however, there is no question that we still have cultural differences and special identities and, in particular, our own languages. This diversity, though it could be seen as just an obstacle, is in fact a source of great wealth and vitality. Although it has not been approved, I have therefore voted in favour of the proposal that the European Union Treaty be modified, so that there can be Community legislation in the field of respect and protection for languages, particularly minority languages, as well as the creation of a European Agency for Linguistic Diversity and Multilingualism. I have also voted in favour of promoting the learning by all European citizens of at least two other languages in addition to their own, since I believe that that is the best way to bring about mutual understanding, co-existence and unity.

Mr President, I would like to reiterate what Mr Guardans said to you: that, at the end of the debate on the peace process, you stated that the vote would be at half past twelve, at 12.30, and, furthermore, in the Castilian that you speak so well, what you said – 12.30, after the formal sitting – is in no way inconsistent with voting time taking place at 12.30. The second part would simply be a safeguard so that, in the event that the formal sitting does not end at 12.30, the vote could take place after it. That is what your Castilian words mean.

Mr President, as a Basque political representative, I do not believe that I am mistaken in saying that, for the great majority of Basque citizens, of Euskadi or of Euskal Herria, today is a great day, an historic day, on which this Parliament, the institution representing all of the Europeans, is finally agreeing to turn its attention to a part of its internal territory which has been suffering a conflict for a very long time, a conflict which, because it has not been dealt with properly or quickly enough, has led a group of extremists to resort to violence over recent years, spreading death and pain. Today, Basque society has rejected the use of violence to achieve political objectives and fortunately it would appear to have genuinely opted for a democratic solution to the conflict. I would call upon those people who have not wanted to make it possible for the citizens to speak rather than bombs, to reflect and to look to the future, and, once this Parliament has voted by a majority, to democratically accept the Resolution approved and allow the process to move ahead. Finally, on behalf of the majority of the Basque people, I would like to thank all of the Members of the European Parliament, who, by voting by a majority in favour of this motion for a resolution, will have given us the opportunity to achieve peace. I trust that we will not let you down.

Mr President, Commissioner, the European Maritime Safety Agency is ready to take part in the fight against the marine pollution caused by the thousands of ships that plough through Community waters on a daily basis, but we must first acknowledge that the Member States lack the capacity to respond to the great ecological disasters that we suffer periodically, such as the tragic cases of the Erika
 and, in particular, the Prestige
. It is fair to recognise that we cannot demand that each and every coastal Member State, regardless of its size or wealth, permanently have available sufficient physical and technological resources to respond immediately and effectively to major disasters and accidents. We should also remember that ships do not just transport goods to and from the coastal States, but that they are also part of the supply and trade chain of the other continental or non-maritime States, and therefore the latter should bear a degree of shared responsibility in terms of the risks involved in maritime transport. For all of these reasons, Community measures should and must be taken in order to support and complement those established by the various Member States individually, though those States must remain primarily responsible for both preventing and responding to marine pollution. Amongst those support measures, the European Maritime Safety Agency is establishing a system for the collection and analysis of information on pollution caused by ships, which would include photographic surveillance by satellite, scientific-technical assistance and operational assistance, by means of ships spread out in different geographical maritime regions and ready to act in the event of accidents and disasters at the request of the Member States affected. The present regulation is intended to provide funding for the next seven-year programming period 2007-2013 to cover the costs of these new services. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the proposal with the compromise amendments shared with other parliamentary groups, and we congratulate Mr de Grandes on his good report and the work he has done in order to reach a consensus so that this regulation can be approved at first reading. Nevertheless, I would like to say, for my part, that I am convinced that the greatest maritime pollution is not caused by accidents and disasters, but that there is a great lack of environmental awareness; certain unscrupulous people put their economic interests first and deliberately and wilfully clean out their ships’ tanks and bilges at sea. Satellite photographs may reduce such cases, but I doubt that they will be of any use on cloudy days or when visibility is poor. I would therefore advocate the introduction on all ships of automatic mechanisms for controlling the levels of tanks and bilges at short, regular intervals in order to ascertain whether or not they have been emptied into the waste facilities provided in ports under the MARPOL legislation. This should be obligatory, just as the black box is for aircraft and the tachograph is for lorries. This would be the best way to put an end to deliberate discharges of pollutants, which I believe to be the most numerous and damaging sources of pollution.

Mr President, as an MEP for the Galeuska electoral coalition, I would like to speak on behalf of the Galician Nationalist Bloc, which has asked me to communicate its concern and its political condemnation of all of the fires that have taken place this summer, particularly those that have destroyed huge areas of forest, including the Natura 2000 Network in Galicia, and which, furthermore, have cost the lives of several people. I would like to express my sincerest condolences and solidarity with the families of the victims and all of the people affected. There has been another environmental tragedy in Galicia, which can be added to other ecological disasters, such as the Prestige
. We must therefore once again shout out today ‘Nunca máis 
[never again]’. ‘Nunca máis lume
’, that is to say, no more fires. Unlike the case of the Prestige
, I do not believe that we can in any way criticise the management or response to the disaster on the part of the Galician authorities and the national government, but the fire was so big that it demonstrated the need for greater European solidarity and resources to help the Member States to put out large fires, or to deal with floods, as we are going to approve tomorrow in the case of funding for the fight against marine pollution. At the same time, however, we must not fail to analyse the possible influence on these fires – the majority of which are believed to have been caused deliberately – of extensive planting of non-native species over previous decades, the confused changes of use or town-planning reclassifications of burnt areas, the paper pulp factories’ interest in obtaining cheap wood, or the alleged vengeance of former forest wardens who have not been employed for supervision purposes this summer. We must also analyse the extent to which all of us and the common agricultural policy are responsible for the forced abandonment of traditional agricultural activities by those people who, unable to find any alternative work, have left the rural areas and upset the land-planning balance, and therefore no longer look after the forests, or raise early alarms, or prevent arson attacks. We need to consider all of these things.

Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in the Basque Country we have our own tax system, which is historically separate and different from the Spanish system.

Would the Council be in favour of the idea of imposing a uniform tax system for the Member States without their consent or agreement?

 Mr President, Commissioner, the transport of goods on European roads will increase by more than 60% between now and 2013, and by 2020 it will double in the new Member States. In addition to the congestion that this is going to cause, it will have a major impact on our environment: what we call ‘external costs’. The Commission estimates that, for every euro spent on this programme, six euros will be saved on these external costs. We are not, therefore, happy about the cuts made in the 2007-2013 financial perspective to the budget of EUR 740 million requested by the Commission for this programme for the next seven-year period. We are going to support the proposal and the compromise amendments achieved as a result of considerable efforts by Mr Rack, but we would have liked projects to have been eligible for subsidy if they would have brought about a net reduction in road congestion, whether or not they transferred goods to other modes of transport. We would also have liked to have achieved even lower minimum thresholds for the indicative amounts per euro of subsidy, so that a greater number of small and medium-sized enterprises might have accessed the aid from the programme. However, we welcome the fact that the criterion of the volume of the cargo has been taken into account when evaluating the results of the measures that are subsidised, because it is not the weight of the goods themselves that pollutes and causes congestion, but the volume that they occupy, and consequently and definitively the number of lorries that are needed to transport them. We also welcome the fact that measures carried out in only one Member State are accepted as eligible for subsidy, provided that they represent at least a 50% improvement in cross border traffic with other States. Finally, as I do not wish to go on for too long, I would like to reflect on something, although this might be part of a different proposal: we believe that there also needs to be a discussion regarding our current model of production and subsequent distribution of goods. If we were really incorporating all the external costs of transport without exception, as well as the repercussions of that model on the distribution of the population and land planning, we might have to change the model.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although the continental fishing of eel is not officially subject to the common fisheries policy, we are all aware of the reduction in stocks suffered by this species over recent years, and this could put eel at risk of extinction unless we implement an action plan within the European Union. With a view to tackling this situation, the Commission is presenting us with a proposal for a Regulation containing measures which reflect good intentions but which, in my humble opinion, could be improved. In the Basque Country, which I represent here, we are not just well acquainted with the adult eel, but also its young – the elver – which has historically been an ingredient in one of the most succulent and highly-prized dishes in our cuisine. For this historical reason, we are aware that the life cycle of our eel is very long, that it is a migratory species and that the females, before dying, travel for a year to spawn in the Sargasso Sea, in the Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and Puerto Rico, where they lay up to 20 million leaf-shaped eggs which float freely in ball-shaped groups and are carried by sea currents, taking a year to reach the North American coasts and up to three years to reach European coasts. When they reach our rivers they have undergone a metamorphosis: they have become elvers and they carry on growing until they mature into eels. Since their fishing depends on the lunar cycle, the ban on their fishing from the first to the fifteenth day of each month could lead either to the almost complete closure of that fishing or, quite the opposite, it may have no effect on it, depending on the phase of the moon during that fortnight. It would be more effective to reduce the fishing season in such a way as to reduce the fishing effort by half. Furthermore, the proposed timetable does not appear viable, since the plans require coordination amongst different regions and Member States, and that takes time. Furthermore, since the current knowledge for calculating escape rate is not sufficient and the models currently being investigated within the SLIME project will not be available in the immediate future, the best option is to delay until 2008 the authorisation to fish eel during seasonal bans, as an exception based on a particular management plan. We know that many people live from eel fishing and we cannot destroy the sector, but rather we must find a balance which guarantees the survival of resources at the same time. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also the Council on its working document, which confirms everything that we have said.

Madam President, we are currently talking about integration and a sense of belonging to Europe, and a few minutes ago we were talking about racism and xenophobia. I believe that there are common elements in all of this. A few months ago I visited Canada, and there I saw a very complete programme of integration of immigrants and their families. I would like to ask the Commission whether it intends to create any programme for integrating young immigrants, so that we too may reduce racism and xenophobia, since these new European citizens also have a sense of belonging to our community.

Mr President, Commissioner, having rejected it during the last legislature, today we are once again dealing with the Commission’s proposal for the liberalisation of port services, and we find ourselves once again in practically the same situation, because, in substance, the text we originally rejected has hardly been changed at all. The proposal is similar and the rapporteur is the same person; I say this with respect and affection for my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, but I believe that this proposal will also be rejected by a majority. Being generally in favour of the liberalisation of the markets and also of port services, I cannot support the present proposal; firstly, because the intention is purely to deal with services provided within each port, with the healthy intention of promoting free competition, but not to deal with the very real practices that breach the rules on competition amongst different European ports. I believe that numerous aspects of the normal practices in many ports need to be changed. I believe that some of the abuses and forms of contracting imposed on service providers are unacceptable. Nevertheless, I believe that changes cannot be proposed in such an aggressive way. We must promote an ordered transition and, on the one hand, guarantee safety and efficiency in port operations and, on the other, safeguard the rights of workers. I believe that companies have the right to choose workers freely but they should firstly take on those workers who have already been doing certain jobs and whose employment contracts are still in force. As has happened in other economic sectors in crisis, if there is a surplus of workers, we will have to negotiate a suitable restructuring plan between the trade unions, companies and the administration. Europe and this Parliament must not be seen by the citizens as an instrument for unbridled capitalism. Proposals such as this, which we are discussing today and which I hope we will reject, have contributed to the Dutch and French ‘No’s to the Constitutional Treaty. We must modernise our economy, but with the necessary coverage and protection for the people affected, which is the main objective of any political action. In that way we will have greater moral authority when it comes to condemning the use of violence that we witnessed here yesterday.

Commissioner, the suburban railway network is vital to sustainable urban transport in the majority of European cities. Do you not believe, however, that the liberalisation of the railways, if an international passenger service is allowed to drop off and pick up passengers in two stations within a single Member State, could affect the economic balance and viability of the suburban railway network?
 Josu Ortuondo Larrea (ALDE

Madam President, in order not to repeat what other Members have said, I would like to stress a couple of collateral aspects. Firstly, this directive responds to the profound imbalances in the transport system, within which road transport is progressively increasing its share and is in danger of collapse. Meanwhile, there are certain other forms of transport that are losing share and volume, as in the case of goods by rail. I believe that railways are a more sustainable and less polluting means of transport than lorries, and that we must discriminate positively in their favour until they can manage by themselves. Goods transport by rail is still subordinate to passenger transport by rail and its average speed is therefore not very competitive. We must construct more sections of line exclusively for goods and, if we do that, we will enjoy clear economic and environmental benefits in the medium term. The second aspect relates to the need to promote the interoperability of European toll systems. There are stretches of our network in which, within little more than twenty-five kilometres, there are five motorway toll stations, which inevitably increases congestion. We are still awaiting the proposed legislation in this regard from the Commission. Let us hope that it does not take five years.

Commissioner, I agree that the States should take measures to strengthen the development policy in those countries which, precisely because they do not offer their citizens opportunities, send us more and more immigrants, causing serious problems in the European Union.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Sterckx, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Savary and Mr Zīle on their reports on the liberalisation of rail transport networks and services in the European Union, the quality of service, the certification of crews and the rights and obligations of passengers. For our part, and with regard to the development of Community railways, we are fully in favour of supporting the opening up of transport services in general and, in particular, of passenger transport by rail, to private competition, though we are working on the basis that the road infrastructure is in the hands of independent managers, so that all possible users of the networks may have equal opportunities to access them. In this regard, we are calling for the opening up of international rail passenger services to be brought forward to 2008 and we accept that the different Member States should be able to delay the liberalisation of the other national, regional and local passenger services until 2012. We believe that this opening up should be carried out in a regulated fashion and without jeopardising the economic viability and survival of pre-existing services of public interest. We do not want to prejudice either the citizens or the urban, metropolitan or regional transport services which currently exist under the aegis of the public institutions. We have advocated that, if the relevant objective economic analyses carried out by the regulatory bodies of each Member State show it to be advisable, the States should be able limit the right of access of an international service to a particular infrastructure on a regional route or restrict the right to pick up or drop off passengers at stations on that route. Furthermore, we shall advocate reciprocal treatment, in such a way that those States which bring forward their opening up to private rail services may temporarily restrict that right to companies belonging to rail groups based in those other States in which similar conditions of freedom of access to the rail infrastructure do not exist. In other words, if a State does not open up its networks to competition, its companies will not be able to operate in other States which have done so. Finally, we believe that contracts for the provision of private rail services must have a duration of five years, which may be extended to 10 years in the event that they use a specialised infrastructure and require significant investments. A longer period could only be authorised in very special cases of very large long-term investments, which would require, for this purpose, the inclusion of a multi-annual repayment plan which would deal with time periods, investments, disinvestments, repayments and how to deal with such a significant initial economic outlay. We believe that the opening up and liberalisation of passenger services with every guarantee of quality, safety and certification of drivers, as well as appropriate regulation of the rights of passengers, will provide the Union’s citizens with the mobility necessary for the sustainable development and progress that we see as our future objective.

Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, I have no intention of telling you my life story, but as an example of what we are debating here today, I will tell you that during the last decade, that is to say, during the nineties, I administered a metropolitan city of one million inhabitants which was experiencing a great depression and undergoing industrial restructuring. As Mayor and President of the Municipal Corporation of the City of Bilbao, I placed a lot of faith in the theories of a respected professor of marketing, Philip Kotler. He is the author of several publications, of which my favourite is entitled The Marketing of Nations
. In it, Kotler says that a country, region or city that wants to offer its citizens opportunities for progress and well-being must pursue three equally important great objectives, namely to sell the goods it produces to the outside, to attract investments and to attract tourism. Tourism is understood to mean not just leisure tourism, but also business, educational, scientific, sporting, and cultural tourism, for example. Today, my city has famously increased its income per capita
 as a result of the considerable increase in tourism resulting from its urban transformation. Bilbao has become a centre for services, trade, business and culture within its industrial hinterland. There is no need to remind you of the important contribution of tourism, which provides 4% of the European Union’s GDP, nor of the seven million direct jobs generated by more than two million companies, the vast majority of which are small or medium-sized businesses. I would therefore like to say to you that I openly reiterate my support for the proposal to create an adequate budget line within the Union’s budget to support the tourism sector, as well as the other requests or amendments introduced into the original text by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. I have in mind the reduced rate of VAT for restaurants, improving the professional training of workers, the introduction of a European classification of tourist services and strengthening the rights of tourists and their protection as consumers. But there is one aspect included in the wonderful report by Mr Luis Queiró that I would like to stress. I am referring to transport as a necessary support to guarantee the mobility and the journeys of the millions of citizens who make up the base of tourism. In particular I would like to draw attention to the trans-European road transport networks. Every summer or holiday period these become jammed with kilometres of tail-backs of thousands of lorries and cars that have to stop repeatedly because of the excessive number of motorway toll points along a particular route. We frequently experience one example of this inefficiency at the Viriatu pass between Spain and France, where there are five toll stations within a stretch of 50 kilometres.

Mr President, the first thing we have suggested to the Committee on Transport and Tourism is that the Cohesion Fund aid should not just include the trans-European transport networks defined in the Decision of 1996, that is to say, those approved by the Essen Council, but also all of those identified by the high-level Van Miert Group, which also deals with the new Member States, motorways of the sea and the GALILEO project, all of which are included in our decision of last year, 2004. Furthermore, with regard to the fields to which Cohesion Fund aid should be directed, we recommend that routes equivalent to motorways or state roads that connect trans-European networks also be considered and that rail rolling stock and collective means of transport be included, as well as the road infrastructure for coach and bus transport. Finally, we suggest that the regulation we are debating today should not prevent the Council from extending the application of the Cohesion Fund, on an annually-decreasing basis during 2007-2013, to Member States whose wealth exceeds 90% of the European average, not because they have experienced positive developments in their economic growth, but because of the simple statistical effect of the incorporation into the union of new Member States with below average GDP. Unless we do that, we will be deceiving ourselves.

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union's motto is ‘unity in diversity’, and you are well aware that, without respect for that linguistic and cultural diversity, this Europe could not be constructed. You have responded positively by saying that the Council is concerned and that it is monitoring the issue of Turkey and the right of children to be educated in their mother tongue, but I would like to ask you whether you are going to do more than simply monitor this issue. I believe that the Council of Ministers should do something with regard to Turkey at this point — draw its attention to the issue in some way — so that in relation to this issue we are not simply awaiting the next report from the Commission on compliance or otherwise with the Community acquis. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what do you intend to do in this regard?

Madam President, Commissioner, in the Basque Country we have already voted on the Constitutional Treaty and we have voted in favour, but one of the things I have noticed is that those who opposed the Constitution argued that the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights reduced the rights already enjoyed by the citizens of the majority of the Member States, particularly in the field of housing, work, etc.  I would like to ask you what we could do amongst all of us, including the Commission, to ensure that the citizens of Europe understand that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an addition to the rights already guaranteed by the Constitutions of the States and that European citizenship is an addition to the citizenships of the Member States.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Miguélez Ramos and Mr Morillon for the magnificent reports they have presented to us and which we are debating today in this Parliament. At the end of 2003, the Commission proposed a recovery plan for southern European stocks of hake and Norway lobster, which, according to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, would be threatened due to high levels of mortality resulting from the fishing of mature fish of those species, which was reducing their capacity for regeneration through natural biological reproduction. I have certain reservations about the full validity of the reports which we considered in evaluating the situation of the stocks of these species, since the associations of shipowners and professionals from these fishing grounds, or at least those that I have consulted, claim that the best way to find out whether or not stocks are at risk is by casting a net into the sea. Of course, the net must fully comply with the legislation in force. If it comes out with fish in it, it cannot be claimed that the species is in danger, and they are bringing up more fish than ever. Nevertheless, nobody has a greater interest in maintaining fish stocks than the people who live from this fishing sector and whose economy and way of life depends on them and, therefore, they largely accept, as we all do, that measures need to be established to protect stocks of southern hake and Norway lobster. It is possible, however, that the application of some of the measures proposed may affect the socio-economic reality of the sector, and it is therefore absolutely essential that the regulation provides for some type of mechanism to alleviate the consequences that the planned restrictions of fishing capacity are going to have for the people affected and to compensate for the damage done to the sector. Furthermore, the fishermen and companies must know that this assistance is available to them in order to provide them with the incentive to participate significantly in the recovery plans being considered. We are also in favour of controlling the quantities of mature fish of each species and not levels of mortality, and of the measures adopted extending over 10 years and the annual variations of allowable tonnes of catch not exceeding any more or less than 10%.

There is another very important pass in the Pyrenees, the Biriatou pass, which I imagine you will know well and which carries the greatest density of traffic on the Franco-Spanish border. Every holiday period — and it will soon be Easter — there are enormous traffic jams, because within 25 km on the French side and 25 km on the Spanish side there are six obligatory stops for motorway tolls. Commissioner, do you not believe that we should take some measure in this regard, in order to prevent drivers from having to stop six times and kilometres of queues at this Biriatou pass?

Thank you very much for your reply, Mr Piebalgs. I wish you every success in the new Doha Round, and I hope that these differences can be reconciled, because the manufacturers of hand tools for professional use are small businesses which provide employment for workers and families which live and depend on that success in the next Doha Round. I would also like you to communicate to the Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, the question relating to the similar situation in commercial exchanges with Russia, where these tools of European manufacture are penalised with taxes of 15%. I do not believe that either the United States or Russia deserve to be in the system of generalised preferences or have assistance tariffs. I hope that Mr Mandelson will reply to this question in writing.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, oil is dumped at sea every six minutes and more than 20 000 tonnes of oil is dumped into European seas each year as a result of maritime traffic, enough to fill 10 000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. That is what is stated in the OCEANA report on sea pollution, which has also been mentioned by Mr Piecyk. However, this report says more. For example that each year 3 000 illegal dumpings of oil are detected each year, but there may be many more deliberate discharges because, for example, in the busiest port in the whole of the European Union and one of the most important in the world, Rotterdam, just 7% of the ships which dock there deposit the waste from their bilges and tanks in the port collection installations. Where do they dump the other 93%? Most of it in the sea, probably. We must approve more effective control legislation as soon as possible in order to prevent the more than 77 000 deaths per year of birds as a result of oil impregnation and the unknown number of deaths of cetaceans, turtles, fish species and marine fauna and flora in general, as well as rules which also put an end to pollution of coasts and beaches everywhere. Patented on-board monitoring instruments are in the process of being approved, a kind of inviolable black box which can reliably verify whether a ship has carried out illegal dumpings. In the implementation of the accompanying measures laid down in Article 10 of the Directive we are debating today, all ships must be required to install these black boxes, all ports, without exception, must have installations for collecting waste and State and Community systems for registering controlled illegal discharges must be established, and there must be public information on illegal dumping and the penalties applied as a result of it. The States must be obliged to comply with the legislation requiring them to provide refuge ports for ships in trouble and a European coastguard service must be created to control dumping, illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Furthermore, it is essential that sanctions be applied to all those involved in the sea transport chain without exception, including the owners of the cargo and contracting agents, charterers, consignees, shipowners, classification societies and insurers, captains, crew members and others, regardless of whether they carry out their duties on land or at sea, if they are responsible for those accidents or dumping. The International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage must also be periodically increased and updated and brought into line with the real damage caused and more appropriate account must be taken of the contributions of shipowners, owners, charterers and receivers of oil cargo. All of this must be applied immediately in Europe and we must demand that it be extended to the rest of the world by means of the International Maritime Organisation, because if we wait for it to be agreed there, we may find that the North Sea, the Baltic or, in particular, the Mediterranean have been damaged beyond repair. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, very warmly for her wonderful report and for all the work she has done, both with a view to agreeing on common positions amongst the parliamentary groups, and within the trialogue with the Council and the Commission, and with a view to completing this legislative procedure at this second reading. I can inform you that our group has just accepted the thirteen compromise amendments and has also agreed to withdraw the three amendments we had presented. We have done all of this so that we can approve this report tomorrow and so that this crucial Directive can enter into force as quickly as possible.

I would like to begin by thanking the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Schmit, for the extensive information he has given us in his reply and also for his sensitivity, because, as a representative of an inland country, he has given us a great deal of information with regard to the European Union's maritime borders. In this respect, I would like to stress that Europe has an enormous sea border and point out that, on the seas bordering Europe, hundreds and thousands of people die tragically every year. We in the European Parliament have frequently called for the creation of a European coastguard service, which, as well as dealing with the needs of those people whose precarious situation obliges them to try to enter Europe by crossing our seas with difficulty, could also help to control the sea pollution affecting our coasts. Has the Council dealt with this issue? What is its view of the European coastguard service?

Mr President, if I had to define the spirit of the Constitutional Treaty, I would say, firstly, that it is integrationist; secondly, that it is based on free accession; thirdly, that it is respectful of different identities, cultures, languages and institutional structures and creates a European citizenship which does not exclude, but rather co-exists with, other citizens from the Member countries. In the Basque country, our Parliament has just approved, by an absolute majority, a new Statute for co-existence with the Spanish State which, in fact, is inspired by the Community model, which maintains these same principles I have indicated and is respectful of the Constitutional Treaty. Nevertheless, in this morning’s debate one Member has accused it of attacking the European Constitution and has said that the Basque President and the Basque Nationalist Party have allied themselves with the enemies of Europe. That is entirely false. We are going to support a ‘yes’ vote and we advocate a ‘yes’ to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in the coming referendum. And we want to be able to live together in peace and friendship with the other peoples of the Spanish State, on the basis of mutual respect for different identities and languages, free accession and common work within a united Europe. We Basques have supported European integration from the outset, and we want to be more European and are working for a common future with all Europeans under the new Constitutional Treaty.

Mr President, we have, on occasions, received complaints from the European regions that it is the Governments of the States that distribute the Cohesion Funds and also the regional element of the Structural Funds, and on occasions those regions of the same political colour as the Government of the State receive favourable treatment. Mr Barnier, then Commissioner responsible for Regional Policy, announced to us an instrument which the regions could access directly without having to go through the Governments of the States. I do not know whether the initiative on European cross-border cooperation groupings, which is on the table in the Council and will also come to Parliament, is the instrument Mr Barnier was referring to. Would the Council agree that the regions should have the possibility of accessing the funds directly without having to go through the Governments of the States?

Thank you for your reply, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. You have said it: the European Union as such does not belong to the WTO. Nevertheless, according to the Constitutional Treaty, the environment is an exclusive competence of the European Union. I would like to know the Council’s view on the idea of the European Commission participating in the WTO on behalf of the Union. Also, an amendment to the Directive on penalties for marine pollution approved at first reading by the European Parliament proposes that ships with Community flags should be responsible in any part of the world. The Council is opposed to this. I would like to know which Member States are opposed to this measure. Could they possibly be the European States with flags of convenience?

Mr President, the last speaker but one, who spoke on previous points of order, was celebrating the fact that it was the 25th anniversary of the approval of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, and on the occasion of this anniversary, he has proposed that this Parliament congratulate the Basque Parliament on this day, 25 October, 25 years after the approval of that Statute. I would like to point out that he forgot to mention that, following a quarter of a century with this Statute in place, 37 transfers remain outstanding and we are talking about an Organic Law of the Spanish State which has not been fully complied with.

I would like to add to Mrs Isler Béguin’s question by asking whether the Council is really in a position to try to defend the Kyoto Protocol in its relations with third countries, when I still do not know the Council’s true position on that Protocol. How much harmonisation is there amongst the Member States’ policies on the implementation of the Kyoto Treaty and what position will the Member States’ take on 28 September when the International Civil Aviation Organisation considers an amendment which would turn the ICAO regulation on its head in terms of emissions from aeroplanes on international flights?

Mr President, Mr Barroso, allow me firstly to congratulate you on your nomination to the post of future President of the European Commission, and allow me also to make a few comments on three points I believe to be important. Firstly, on the role of the Commission and the appointment of its President, secondly, on the common foreign and security policy and, thirdly, on diversity, subsidiarity and shared sovereignties in the European Union. Firstly, the role of the Commission and the appointment of its President. For the moment, you have been nominated by the Heads of Government, by the European Council, and it falls to this Parliament, to this House, to approve your nomination, which will finally be ratified, together with that of the other members of the Commission, by the Governments of the Member States. With the new Constitutional Treaty, which will enter into force during these five years of your coming term in office, and also that of this Parliament, this issue is going to change, and it will be the European Council which, taking account of the result of the elections, will propose to Parliament the candidate to be elected President of the Commission, who will then be elected by the European Parliament. I believe this to be a step forward, although I do not yet consider it to be a decisive step. I would like to ask you, Mr Barroso, whether you believe that, with the new Constitutional Treaty, the Commission is really going to become a genuine executive government for the Union; whether you believe that, when the citizens vote in the elections to the European Parliament, they are truly going to feel that their vote is decisive and that with it they are going to be electing a President who will govern the Union over the coming years. We have had an entirely negative experience, because turnout has been extremely low. I believe this is because the citizens have not felt that their vote would achieve this. Secondly, you hosted the meeting in the Azores which determined the invasion and war in Iraq. I would like to ask you whether, in your new post, if a similar situation arose, you would allow individual Member States of the European Union to take a similar decision without having first consulted the Council, without there previously being a common position amongst all the Member States of the European Union. And thirdly, with regard to diversity, this Constitutional Treaty talks about the powers of the European institutions and also of the state institutions. It talks about the Union's exclusive competences and about shared competences, but there is real diversity within the Union which has not been considered: the stateless nations and the constitutional regions, which have competences which the central governments of the States cannot decide upon. What do you intend to do during your mandate to genuinely integrate the Union's true cultural and institutional diversity into the European Union?
