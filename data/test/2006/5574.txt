Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, wanting a recovery plan is a good intention. A Keynesian recovery is needed to respond to a cyclical downturn, but this crisis is structural. The tool, then, is inadequate. Re-injecting funds into an unrestrained economy is just throwing money down the drain. In fact, boosting an economy without first having restored Community preference at our borders is like trying to warm a house when all the windows have to be left open. What happens is the boiler runs out and the heating bills go through the roof. After these opening remarks, I have three comments to make. Firstly, an energy market is not relevant. In fact, in this area, competition does not reduce prices because these are determined by the costs of the means of production. We believe, therefore, that it is essential to invest in truly efficient energy sources, to avoid the trap of energy sources that are largely subsidised, such as wind power, and to opt for solar and nuclear energy. Secondly, there is no efficiency in a single electricity market. Over a large distance, energy loss is proportionate to the distance travelled. The likelihood of breakdowns and outages grows with the geographical complexity of the network. Therefore, the interconnection of Europe’s electricity network should get back to its primary purpose, which is to serve as a reciprocal backup resource at the borders and to allow energy swaps, but merely in the background. This work should be our priority. Thirdly, as for the Podimata report, which relates to the current report, we recommend that we not only take into account the energy needed to operate a product, but also consider information on the amount of energy needed to manufacture that product. The communication of this information to consumers will enhance the standing of those products with high added-value and low energy requirements. The inclusion of this information will give a much-needed competitive advantage to our economies, which are under too great a threat of unfair global competition.

 As a French Member of the European Parliament and a member of the Independence and Democracy Group, I chose not to support Amendments 51 and 52 to Mr Corbett’s report. It is, in fact, unreasonable to change a general rule to suit a specific case. Moreover, these manoeuvres will undoubtedly have the opposite effect to that intended, in other words, they will highlight the disrespect in which many Members hold some of their fellow Members and candidates. Moreover, there is nothing to prevent a political party unhappy with the current oldest Member from presenting an older candidate.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the reform of the common market organisation (CMO) imposed by the united forces of the lobbyists and Eurocrats will cause three serious problems. It aims to eliminate the market regulation mechanisms, liberalise planting rights from 2015 and allow the cohabitation, under virtually identical labels, of very different categories of wine. These three heresies will be fatal to European wine-growing, particularly in France. Consumers will be misled in their choices, wine-growers will see their incomes collapse, and the industrialisation of the sector will lead to the loss of specialist know-how. This systematic dismantling of the fundamental principles which define the specific nature of European wine-growing responds to a peculiar logic. Trapped between its submission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the influence of the all-powerful European big business lobby, the CEEV, the Commission has since 2004 systematically devoted itself to opening the doors of the European henhouse to all the foxes roaming the planet. It increasingly seems to be acting as the shoehorn of globalisation. This incoherent logic becomes clearly apparent on examining two sets of figures. In Europe, 170 000 hectares of vines have been uprooted, whereas in New Zealand the planted area has increased by 240%, in Australia by 169% and in China by 164%. In Europe, the reduction in supply to keep prices at a decent level is being undermined by the actions of large-scale wine manufacturers who are offloading their surplus products at low prices and thus grabbing the spare market. This sums up the racket in the rosé market. It reveals the contradictions that exist between the WTO principles and those needed to organise a sector in order to promote investment, quality and know-how. Yesterday we successfully discovered that quality would in the future turn to quantity. With the Commissioner’s reforms, it is becoming clear that today’s decisions will kill tomorrow’s know-how. Commissioner, it is vital to prohibit blending before 7 June. After that, the only weapon left to wine-growers in order to make their voices heard will be the vote.

 Commissioner, indicating ‘rosé wine’ on the bottle is pointless, since good rosé wines, such as the Bandol that I have brought you, do not specify the word ‘rosé’. Moreover, indicating ‘traditional rosé’ on the label is stupid. Rosé is a wine which the young drink; it is a modern wine, even if its production requires traditional know-how. Therefore, there is too much ambiguity. There are not 36 different solutions, there is only one, since, as was explained very well earlier, rosé is a cultural wine, it is a product made by experts. We are not dealing with any old business here. What we need is a pure and simple ban on all blending and mixing in Europe, and in France in particular.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today Turkey seems to function as a democracy, but it is not for the European Union to give endless lessons on good conduct, when the EU itself cheerfully and unscrupulously bypasses the sovereign will of its constituent peoples when they vote in referenda. Basically, Turkey is still a long way from respecting the values of the European nations, as demonstrated by the situation of the countless ethnic and religious minorities which make up the country. The situation of millions of Kurds is slow to improve. Relations with the Armenians or even their Greek neighbours are under constant diplomatic or military pressure. Cyprus is still under Turkish military occupation, in defiance of international law. This has gone on for 35 years. Religious minorities scarcely fare better. The rights of the communities not listed in the treaties are regularly trampled on, under the blind eye of the European Commission, which continues, as does Parliament, to support the accession of this country to the European Union. Therefore, let us be consistent. While cooperation with Turkey is essential, any accession plans for Turkey must be made in accordance with the European democracies, namely through referenda.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ten years ago NATO bombed Belgrade, no doubt in order to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary and to redefine its area of competence, which is restricted by the Washington Convention. These bombings were carried out in violation of international law, that is to say, without any prior UN agreement. One year ago, the independence of Kosovo was declared unilaterally by Priština in blatant contempt of the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, whose sovereignty and territorial integrity had however been reaffirmed by UN Security Council Resolution 1244. Today, the European EULEX mission, in association with US experts, hopes that Kosovo can become a state based on the rule of law. If the situation were not so dreadful, it would be amusing to wonder how such a fruit can be obtained from such origins. In the meantime, we ask this mission to ensure that the national Serbian minority is respected and valued on the land of their ancestors. This seems to us to be a good beginning for the re-establishment of the rule of law.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the structural causes of the crisis in the automotive sector and its subcontractors. This sector, as was the case for agriculture and textiles, is suffering social, environmental and tax relocations and dumping. What are we going to do when the Americans, as the dollar is falling, sell their gas-guzzling, subsidised and highly promoted 4x4s on our market, which is also under siege from bottom-of-the-range vehicles from Turkey, India and China? There is a solution. We must re-establish the common external tariffs abolished by the Maastricht Agreements. Only compensatory duties at the borders of the European Union can re-establish a genuine and fair international exchange. Let us dare to do what common sense dictates before it is too late. However, as you know, Protocol 27 and Article 63 of the Treaty of Lisbon strictly prohibit any customs protection of the European market. Ladies and gentlemen, let us be consistent. Let us no longer cherish causes which are so detrimental to us. Let us finally bury this damaging treaty and stop playing at pyromaniac firefighters.

 Mr President, our cultures include the rule of law and individual rights and so it is right and proper to defend the rights of an individual member of a minority but it would be dangerous to legislate on the rights of non-national minorities as communities in their own right. For non-national minorities, and I am only talking about them, the community approach has to be rejected because it will inevitably destroy the coherence of many European nations. Where there is rule of law, regulation of the way in which people live together must remain a national power. In this matter, if the majority were the enemy of the minority, then this would seriously call democracy into question. Faced with poverty or danger, some people flee their country of origin to seek refuge. The right to asylum is a way for people to vote with their feet. Fortunately, it has become a fundamental right but, as with any right, there is a concomitant duty. In this instance, the duty is to accept the rules, languages and customs of the receiving countries. The right of asylum is a precious right as it is a right inherent to the human being. Even if you belong to a minority, this does not legitimise the creation of a community right. Your ultimate allegiance must always be to the country in which you settle. It is an illusion to believe that the juxtaposition of transitory communities, with different memories, can create a country. Over time, this will only create either a field of indifference or a field for a battle. You should either love your receiving country or get out. That is the duty which is born of the freedom to come and go.

Mr President, several thousand years ago, David confronted Goliath in order to find out whether the land was destined for the Moabites, the Philistines or the Hebrews. Currently the same drama is continuing on this land, the source of one of the three pillars of our civilisation. Today it is urgent, right, legitimate and necessary to ensure the security and recognition of the State of Israel. To do so, a single solution is required, and that is to guarantee the birth of a truly sovereign Palestinian State. Here, as elsewhere, multiculturalism has its limits. Where there are two peoples, there must be two States. If the European Union’s aid is indeed effective, then it must be focused on one objective: that of ensuring the growth of this Palestinian constitutional state where the rule of law protects the weak and helps the strong. There is a sense of urgency, since, on this land, the extremists on all sides are powerful and in the wrong, while the children are moderate and victims. The solution for transcending the demands of ‘an eye for an eye’ is neither moral, nor military, but political. So, it is time to get down to work!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission intends to reduce the administrative burden on businesses, which is, in essence, a good intention. However, wanting to scrimp and save all the time will not fundamentally change the situation: excessive standardisation, countless decision-making levels and systematic constraints continue to be created in parallel by the Commission and imposed on European businesses, no matter what their size. Today, only three States do not recognise the need for information to be published on businesses – from their creation to their closure – and the Commission itself admits that part of the information is lost. This loss will affect those who need the information most, namely individuals and SMEs, surrounding micro-enterprises and people directly linked to such businesses. This proposal transforms transferable information, that is, information that anyone can access fairly easily, into contestable information to which, in the long term, only professionals with a precise knowledge of their search objective will have access. We cannot really accept this proposal since, acting in the spirit of a responsible legislator, the intended recipients of the economic information must systematically be all interested citizens, consumers and investors, and this, without any specific action being taken. At the same time, this proposal can and certainly will have damaging consequences for the regional press, which is already in difficulty, since its remit is to publish judicial and legal announcements, which can account for between 25-50% of its advertising revenue. These newspapers have a vital economic and social role to play. They must be protected, because protecting them means protecting their social role in the local community. We would do well, perhaps, to try to make savings and to focus our work on other matters. As far as we are concerned, today, this particular matter is not ready.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the 14th consecutive year, the European Court of Auditors has refused to approve the budget of the European Union. While the Commission’s accounting procedures have been praised by the Court – which is nonetheless the least of things – you will note that only 8% of the European Union’s accounts are duly approved. We all understand that at this rate, no private enterprise could survive such criticism. That means that 92% of the European budget, that is to say, more than EUR 100 billion, remains affected by an excessively high level of discrepancies and irregularities. I was just quoting from the report. These irregularities are accompanied by many irresponsible acts. When you think, for instance, that a communication agency has a budget of EUR 15.4 million to send a ballot box into space with the slogan ‘You can vote anywhere’, people may rightly feel that you are mocking them. In the current climate, where households and Member States are having to tighten their belts, at a time when France is a net contributor of EUR 7 billion, we need to stop taking French and European taxpayers as Santa Claus figures for the European Union, since in June, they will become bogeymen.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, respecting the environment and competitiveness should not be separated. Together they produce performance. Unfortunately, the mechanism put forward by Parliament will remain a compromise that may be ineffective, because it is lacking two things. It lacks the establishment of compensatory rights at the borders. Without this key element, our requirements will not be compensated for at global level. They will become additional production costs, curbs on expansion, accelerators of carbon leakage, imports destroying our jobs. Without any compensatory rights at the borders of the Union, our qualities are in danger of becoming defects. It also lacks a bold policy to allocate carbon rights to forests and the wood industry. This would have increased the value of forests in developing countries, limited CO2
 emissions and promoted the most elementary source of carbon. These two common-sense remarks mean that this report, which is full of good intentions, could just be a huge waste of energy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my former capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Transport, I held a enthusiastic viewpoint on the Galileo project. Today, we see that this central project was bogged down due to the omnipotence and technocratic inertia of our institutions. Every time that the Union refused free and variable cooperation between States, they sterilised private initiative, increased costs and impeded the emergence of rival, competent and coherent consortiums. Yet on each occasion that states have united together freely, projects have succeeded. Hence, here, as elsewhere, the role of our institutions is to maintain a simple substitute role, wishing to be the manager of all, whereas we ought to be the guarantors of little. We should bear one thing in mind: when dealing with space matters, Europe must, first of all, keep its feet on the ground.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate is crucial. One of the keys to the future of our continent lies in our capacity to prevent a deep split from dividing the Mediterranean Basin into two antagonistic sides, culturally and economically. In spite of all the differences between the two shores of the mare nostrum
, what unites us is even stronger than what separates us. That is why Nicolas Sarkozy’s initiative is excellent in principle: it breathes new life into a Barcelona Process that is marking time. I do have some reservations about the method, however. When France signed up to the European commitments in the various Treaties, from Maastricht to Lisbon, it agreed to transfer to the Community – and this is something I regret – a number of its prerogatives, notably in the area of foreign affairs. With all due respect to Mr Guénot, that is unfortunately the world in which these Treaties oblige us to live. That is why, in my opinion, it is somewhat inconsistent to launch such a project, to great media hullabaloo. In reality, France no longer has the power to force it on anyone. The only way to move it forward was to make use of all of the diplomatic and human resources available to France to convince its partners to carry out the reform of the Barcelona Process, without giving the impression of undoing what had already been achieved, even if what existed was far from satisfactory. The result of this inconsistency can be seen today because it is certainly no coincidence that this debate was postponed from yesterday, when the Council could have taken part, to this morning, when only the Commission is represented. This must be more than a sign: the Commission has no intention of relinquishing this matter.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, natural disasters sadden us all the more because they create so many victims, as recently in China or Burma. They remind us of the value of any human life, and also the fact that we cannot control nature. We wish to send a message of compassion to those suffering natural and political disasters. One of the aims of politicians is to prevent public misfortune from befalling their people. Thus, if they cannot prevent natural disasters, they can attempt to anticipate them and alert the people, and above all they must minimise risk through responsible prevention policies. By way of example, China’s Promethean infrastructure, such as its huge power dams and nuclear power plants, has held out. Yet how long can it hold out? Is it not better to use a larger number of smaller structures to spread the risk, and increase public information on the risks involved? The most tragic situation for the Chinese people, however, is in relation to political disasters. Although we acknowledge the admirable character of this hard-working skilful people and its sensitive culture, we can judge political acts without delving too far into domestic policies. Its calamitous single-child policy is a major disaster. It affects children, the large numbers of peasant families obliged to dispose of daughters, a poor source of revenue that does nothing to ensure the continuity of farms and retirement, or the second child who has no right to exist on the orders of Creon. Such is the disdain for human rights when a political order does not allow parents to have as many children as they want. Here again, life is not considered at its true value, but as a mere utilitarian function. Natural disaster and political disaster merge, however, when a school’s roof falls in, crushing the only child and leaving the parents distraught. When the 30 000 journalists expected in Beijing for the Olympic Games arrive there, they should take time out to investigate, beyond mere appearances, the reality of this country which, through overriding power and efficiency, risks losing all respect for human beings, the real basis of the political order.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, trade between nations is a good thing. Free trade is desirable, but today the world has changed and the WTO’s rules are ill-adapted and in many cases need to be amended. The very nature of international trade has changed. In the past trade was based on complementarity: we sought what we did not have and exported any surpluses. That order made nations prosperous. Today, however, social dumping reigns. We abandon what we know how to do in order to import what somebody else is doing cheaper, not because it is more profitable, but because there are less costs, less taxes, less social constraints. This WTO order allows the poor countries, the poor in the rich countries, to make the rich in the poor countries even richer. It is less and less based on solidarity or on mutual agreements between nations; rather it is an order that is disrupting nations and creating a conflict between the winners and the losers. The WTO rules therefore have to be changed. They must restore the Community preference and revive the spirit of the Treaty of Rome, which established the common external tariff. That was not over-cautious protection, but fair compensation in the face of social dumping. The founding fathers were not always wrong. The WTO must incorporate the erratic exchange rate fluctuations in its evaluation of trade constraints. It is unacceptable for the yuan to remain so low when the country has such a high foreign trade surplus. It is outrageous that EADS loses a billion euro every time the dollar falls 10 cents against an ideological euro. In conclusion, the future of truly free trade reminds us that we have a lot to do before we can sit back. On the one hand, we need to restore the border as a condition of the policy and, thus, freedom for the people; on the other hand, we need to allow the monetary and financial policy to take a back seat to the real economy, the productive economy, for it is that economy alone that allows the people to live here in freedom.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for some hours the official Chinese propaganda has been saying that the situation in Tibet is under control again. These statements, as we know, conceal a bloody repression. The reaction of the European authorities is doubly appalling. Firstly, although we must welcome the fact that President Sarkozy is becoming increasingly vocal and is not excluding boycotting the Olympic Games, the attitude of his Foreign Affairs Minister is more than questionable. Bernard Kouchner has on several occasions used the expression ‘our Chinese friends’. Does he know that this bloody dictatorship is trampling over human rights and threatening the Tibetan national identity? Does he know how many political prisoners there are, the youngest in the world being the Panchen Lama? We have to wonder: is it still right for him to talk about human rights on behalf of the country? Since the Han Dynasty, the Chinese have believed that they are superior to the rest of the world. The Communist regime has only served to exacerbate this attitude by advocating an ideology that suppresses all individual and social demands and, in particular, all national demands. In Asia as in Europe, empires and ethnicism are the enemies of the nation. That is the second reason why I am appalled. The European leaders are guilty of a wait-and see attitude in relation to the Tibetan crisis: they who without even thinking recognised Kosovo’s independence a few weeks ago. By imposing the pure, simple and immediate independence of this Serbian province, home of Serbia’s historical and spiritual cradle, Europeans and Americans have risked provoking serious reactions and developing an inconsistent international policy. The policies on Kosovo and Tibet give the impression of unacceptable ‘double standards’, which destroy public faith in diplomatic action. In conclusion, if we do not take account of national heritage and traditions, if we do not ensure fair treatment of people’s rights, we run the risk of seeing our proclamations on human rights being mere incantations devoid of any meaning. I therefore say: long live the Europe of free nations, long live the free Tibet and long live a world of free nations!

The representatives of the Movement for France in the European Parliament have taken a consistent stand since the beginning of the US intervention in Iraq. Our country’s own experience and its ties with the Iraqi people alerted us to the human, military and moral disaster that the intervention would bring. Now the damage is done and it is up to the Member States to act, either alone or collectively, to rescue and re-establish whatever can be salvaged. Before the US intervention, Iraq was the only Muslim country that was home to a large and prosperous Christian community – a community that had lived there even before the arrival of Islam. One of the most tragic consequences of the US intervention has been the exodus of sections of that community, driven out by terror and intimidation. It is a calamity for Iraq, today and in the future. In the bigger picture, the rapid erosion of a religious population mix in the Middle East spells human and economic impoverishment and threatens the entire region’s stability and prosperity. The historian Fernand Braudel considered that history began in Sumaria, but it would seem today that the long history of Christian minorities in Iraq is at an end. We, the nations of Europe, simply cannot condone this enormous injustice by failing to act. Iraqi Christian communities were once open and welcoming to Islam, and together with their Muslim neighbours they built a country that was prosperous before it was ravaged by fanaticism and wars.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Fernand Braudel claimed that history began in Sumer, but today the long history of Christian minorities in Iraq seems to have drawn to a close. We, the nations of Europe, cannot endorse this enormous injustice by taking no action. These people welcomed Islam and together they built a country that was prosperous before it was ravaged by fanaticism and wars. Now these minorities must resign themselves to flight. Iraq cannot build a future without their presence and skills. A future is not built by partitioning a country: it is built by rebuilding its economy, with mutual recognition of different communities and cultures and application of the rule of law. If the EU takes the firm decision to intervene in Iraq, it must constantly remember in its plans the dramatic reality of all these minority communities. Their future must be the yardstick of EU action, and the reality of mutual respect between communities the criterion for the allocation of its aid. This action will thus be a credit to our nations.

 The European Parliament has just approved the Treaty of Lisbon, though nobody was asking it to do so. The Mouvement pour la France delegation in the European Parliament obviously voted against this report, aware of the purely symbolic nature of doing so. It is significant that French and Dutch elected representatives sitting in Strasbourg are voting in favour of a Treaty while clearly admitting that it is a clone of the defunct European Constitution, even though their people formally rejected that text. It is also significant that the European Parliament is voting on a Treaty even though none of its Members has been able to read a consolidated version. After the Hungarian Parliament ratified it in the dark, the European Parliament is approving a text it has not read. The MPF delegation in the European Parliament now wishes all the freedom-loving Irish luck: their referendum will not be theirs alone, they will be voting on behalf of everyone who has not been given the chance to do so, particularly the French, whose vote was cast aside.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, wanting a knowledge economy is a good thing, but it is not enough. Growth in direct or ancillary jobs relies on the sustainability of traditional forms of blue-collar work, but these industries are caught in a vice. With their competitiveness already under threat from the increasing bureaucratic costs in our societies, they are being stifled by the absurd way in which the euro is managed, which generates a competitive additional income for countries that have no serious social or environmental policy whatsoever. The model is back-to-front. We are socialist within the EU and liberal outside it, yet what we need is greater protection from the rest of the world and greater freedom within. The facts make this clear. The Lisbon Strategy does not work because of the asymmetry in Europe’s economies, growing pressure of competition and the hypermobility of the capital markets. Let us therefore abandon the demotivating myth of a European social strategy that guarantees prosperity for all. You cannot make a plant grow by pulling on its leaves! The solutions will come not from Brussels, but from free cooperation and the Member States’ own common sense. It is our roots in the soil of our nations that will give us the intelligence, responsiveness, sense and strength to meet today’s challenges. In this particular case letters to Father Christmas will get us nowhere.

 Ladies and gentlemen, ‘a new man of human rights has been born who has nothing in common with his ancestor of 1789 but the name’: that was the piqued description used by the philosopher Marcel Gauchet to describe the Charter of Fundamental Rights proclaimed here and made binding made by Article 6 of the Lisbon Treaty. We know that in many respects the large number of rights it contains contradict the rights and freedoms protected by our national constitutions. European law is superior to national law, even constitutional law. In that case, what will be left of the secular principle when faced with Article 10 of the Charter, which states that religious freedom includes freedom to manifest one’s religion both publicly and privately? What will be left of the principle of equality when faced with Article 20 and subsequent articles of the Charter, which draw up a catalogue of victims’ rights based on their belonging to a particular group? What will be left of the principle of liberty, which includes the right to self-determination, when faced with Articles 6 to 19 which confuse this with personal rights and the simple power to demand a service from others? What we are trying to do is speed up the transformation of citizens who control their own future into mere consumers, passive service-providers, and we could not do this any better. To my fellow Members who appreciate their countries’ secular freedoms and rights as protected by their constitutions, I can only say two words: wake up.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our fellow citizens – who are also workers, consumers and taxpayers – recognise quite clearly that the European Union, as currently configured, is not so much a bulwark against the excesses of financial globalisation as a staging post on the road to those excesses. For 20 years now we have been promised a shining future, courtesy of the euro and the dismantling of borders; that is what they dangled before us, for example, to win our support for the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. Despite everything, however, our manufacturing base is packing up and pulling out, leaving behind it millions of unemployed, tracts of industrial wasteland and a deserted countryside. To hear President Sarkozy argue the case, before this House, for a mission to protect Europe, one would almost think he had never accepted either Maastricht or the Lisbon Treaty. It is quite splendid to hear him coming on like General de Gaulle and declaring he will stand up in the WTO against any negotiations likely to damage our national interest. He appears to have forgotten, however, that France does not possess a veto and that the only one doing any negotiating is a Commissioner from Brussels, who consistently disregards the terms of reference given him by the Member States. Similar illusions were evident when – once again with every justification – he attacked the deflationary obsession of the independent European Central Bank in Frankfurt. But who are we to believe: the man who stands before the TV cameras proclaiming French sovereignty, or the man who abandons our national sovereignty in a European treaty? The reality is that the Lisbon Treaty confirms the logic of the existing treaties, which bar us from steering the course of the euro, from protecting our markets and from standing up for ourselves in global trade negotiations. Yes, the treaty mentions as an aim the protection of citizens but that is no more than a policy statement without legal force behind it. Significantly, the treaty strengthens the powers and independence of both the Commission and the ECB, with their free-trade thinking. Protocol No 6, and also Articles 3 and 4 of the EC Treaty, reinforce their dogmatic conception of unfettered competition, heedless of national interests, unbridled by borders and careless of democracy. We believe that the people of France and the people of Europe want something different. So let us rehabilitate genuine free trade, in the form of exchange between nations that enriches them without stripping them of either their defences or their identity.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a kind of irony in the Commission claiming that it wants to put the citizen at the centre of the European project in its 2008 legislative programme. It is true that the citizen, the poor lowly citizen, has never before been central to the concerns of the Brussels-Frankfurt-Luxembourg triangle, where practically all the powers will be concentrated from now on, in other words in the hands of institutions that do not even respect the fundamental principles of democracy. How, therefore, can we claim that we are promoting the welfare of our citizens in the era of globalisation when in fact we are in the process of abandoning the principle of the republic, which is government of the people, by the people, for the people? Caring for the citizen means respecting what he has to say. In this regard, the Lisbon Treaty is an insult to the people of our nations, because it is just a copy and paste job of the European Constitution that was overwhelmingly rejected and because it confirms the logic of the current Treaties that prohibit us from controlling the euro, from safeguarding our markets, from protecting our borders from illegal immigration and from defending ourselves in international trade negotiations. In particular – and these remarks are intended especially for my French colleagues in all the parliamentary groups – this Lisbon Treaty does not change the dogmatic concept of competition without balances, without national interests, without frontiers and without any concern for democracy. Its Charter of Fundamental Rights, which takes precedence over the rights of individual Member States, sweeps away the notion of the Citizen of the Republic as laid down in our Constitution and replaces it with the most dangerous form of multiculturalism. As for the Citizen of Europe, no one has ever met him: in fact he does not exist. To conclude, therefore, if anyone here is concerned about the citizen let them start by demanding a general referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.

The French Members of the Independence and Democracy Group voted against the Corbett report on the amendment of Rule 173 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament which seeks to abolish the full and systematic translation of parliamentary debates. The idea behind publishing the debates, which applies to judicial proceedings and political deliberations alike, is one of the fundamental principles of democracy. Publication helps to reduce ideological bias, arbitrariness, cronyism and dirty tricks. This of course is based on the assumption that all have access in their own language to the full published proceedings by ensuring that the same words do indeed express the same notions for everyone. Who among the peoples of Europe would be capable of recounting and understanding a debate when faced with a hotchpotch version of it in twenty languages? It would probably be the same as someone trying to understand the so-called ‘simplified’ treaty and attempting to replace the 400 new clauses contained in the existing treaties, since here too, apparently, no consolidation version has been made available during the ratification process. Faced with increasing reticence from the inhabitants of its Member States, the European Union seems to be capable of displaying nothing but obfuscation, falsification and concealment.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whether we rejoice or lament, everyone agrees that the Treaty to be signed in Lisbon is just a recycling of the European Constitution rejected by two referendums in 2005. As a report yesterday by the House of Commons pointed out, it has everything: the primacy of European law, even secondary law, over national law, even constitutional law; legal personality for the EU, which will allow the Commission to represent the Member States on the international stage; the Minister of Foreign Affairs under another name; the largest transfer of competences in the entire history of European integration; at least forty new subjects; and the vast field of fundamental rights. Within these walls, where the word ‘democracy’ is constantly on our lips, I would like to try and appeal to the consciences of you all. What genuine democracy could think it normal to bring into force a text that the people have rejected in a referendum? Why should the people be deprived of their right to express themselves on the new Treaty and on any fresh enlargements? What sort of political regime do you think you are building by subordinating our democracies a little further to a system characterised by no separation of powers, no political accountability on the part of governments and no representation of the people, except of a single European people? The Italian federalist Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa has already given the answer. I quote: ‘Between the two poles of popular consensus and the leadership of a few governments, Europe has been created by a method that could be defined by the term “enlightened despotism”’. He is right! And the people’s no to their enlightened despotism has convinced federalists that they have to proceed once more under cover, because the only difference between the rejected Constitutional Treaty and the one that is coming is that the first one did not lie.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, enough of all this political hypocrisy. The right of asylum and immigration where similar types of civilisation are concerned is not the problem. The question essentially concerns immigration from another civilisation and this benefits no one. Immigration by job seekers is a double injustice: it robs the country of origin of the skills that it has paid for, while in the host country it drags the labour market down and takes job opportunities from the locally unemployed. Immigration by benefit seekers is a mistake on two counts: it uproots poor people, hypnotised by the lure of the Western world, while in the host country it destabilises the social budgets that have been created and can only survive within the limited and protective context of the nation. This means that, contrary to what was written on the walls of the Members’ restaurant in Brussels a month ago, the European Union does not need immigration. In fact quite the reverse: what Europe needs is a proper family and demographic policy, sovereign cooperation between nations and frontiers, not Frontex. The world needs to understand, for one thing, that peace does not come through immigration but through self-reliant development and, for another, that real proletarianisation sets in when people lose their cultural roots.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a Polish newspaper recently published the following story: What was the first European referendum? Answer: when God, having created Eve, said to Adam: ‘choose your wife’. The image is apt. Today, far away from the Garden of Eden, the Portuguese Presidency has taken over from the German Presidency. The latter will have been marked by its trickery, with an attempt to impose on the people of France and of the Netherlands a barely disguised and pruned text that they rejected by referendum. This mini-treaty is nothing but the Constitution in disguise. Some years ago, Mr Padoa-Schioppa, the father of the euro, wrote a piece in a French journal, the gist of which was that European integration stems more from enlightened despotism than from democracy. We have a vivid illustration of this today with this gross manipulation. How can one say that the new text corresponds to the desire expressed by the people of France and of the Netherlands during the referendums if it is not submitted to another such test by referendum? If I may, Mr President, I shall express a wish in this House at the dawn of the Portuguese Presidency: if we do not want the people of Europe to turn their backs once and for all on the political class, then the Portuguese Presidency must make a total break with its outdated methods and undertake immediately the one genuine European reform that the people expect: less technocracy, more democracy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, competition has its virtues but, in a market economy, before we can just laisser faire
, there is much to be done. Therefore, town and country planning is one of the conditions of the attractiveness, the economic effectiveness and the quality of life. Full privatisation of the postal service can be damaging to town and country planning and, consequently, to the good of the people. France is not a flat country, with a uniform topology. Therefore, according to the location, delivery costs for small items of post differ widely. Privatising the service means that sooner or later it will be charged for at its actual cost or abandoned. Consequently, rural or remote areas, which are already in danger of becoming economic deserts, will suffer a competitive disadvantage which will plunge them into the deflationary spiral. We must, therefore, in this House, admit once more that our countries are different in nature and culture. We must, therefore, give each one them sovereign freedom to find the solution that suits them. The internal market is not an end in itself, it is only a tool at the service of the good of nations. Let us not forget that in the higher interest of our compatriots!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Moscovici has just written a very interesting book, declaring the ConstitutionalTtreaty dead. It shows very clearly that no one can reintroduce a mini-Treaty on the sly now that the people have spoken. We cannot act in contravention of Treaty law. The number is not enough here – all that counts is the sovereignty of a State. The farce in Madrid was an impasse, and an insult to diplomatic rules. I should tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that MEPs, myself included as it happens, did not have access to the debating chamber, while any old civil servant had free access. The solution for the EU is not to recreate Madrid, but to breathe new life into the spirit of the Treaty of Rome, in other words to rediscover the sense of free cooperation between sovereign nations, to re-establish the Community preference and to give up on the vague imperialism of a supranational State, a State that would suffocate our peoples and hinder their rights.

The members of Mouvement pour la France 
in the European Parliament have refused to support the compromise proposed for the vote at second reading on the draft directive on dangerous substances, the so-called REACH Directive. Now that the directive has been examined by the various European institutions, there is little left of its original good intentions. Thus, the compromise text voted on this morning is very inadequate in terms of environmental and consumer protection. Furthermore, the new burdens that it places on European businesses are not compensated for by similar obligations imposed on imports of finished goods, creating a distortion of competition that jeopardises European industry.

Mr President, the German Presidency of the European Union looks set to be a test. A test of the ability of the institutions to take account of the will of the nations. The period of reflection is going to come to an end and the hurdle of the French elections will have been overcome. Those who did not want to accept the demise of the Constitutional Treaty are going to be able to go on the offensive. Dividing up, decoupling and chopping up: the recipes are many, the plans numerous, but none of them propose a real alternative to the supranational project. Only the means of bypassing the Dutch and French referendums are considered, and the positions adopted – I should say the threats made – by Mrs Merkel do not bode at all well. While those who are against the Constitution are scarcely tolerated within our Assembly, do not forget that they are heard by the people. Under those circumstances, I can only reiterate my warnings. The German Presidency must not be the one to do irreparable damage by reviving a Constitution that no one wants, apart from the system, and I dare to hope that this Assembly is not just a chamber that echoes the system, but that it still aspires to represent the nations of Europe, nations that want to remain masters of their own fate on their own soil, that is to say, to be sovereign nations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the referendum in France, the UMP swore that the Bolkestein directive had been withdrawn, and the socialists said that it had been consigned to the dustbin of history. Not only did both parties lie, but they are now making things worse for themselves in at least four respects. Firstly, there is the country of origin principle. We are giving free rein to the Court of Justice, which is the inventor of this concept in its judgments in the 'Cassis de Dijon' and 'Säger' cases. We can hardly imagine that it is going to sacrifice its own creation. The second point relates to the protection of employees. Labour law, which is a national competence, is being made subordinate to compliance with Community law, with no treaty and no ratification. How far are we prepared to go in substituting commercial law for labour law? Thirdly, there is the issue of monitoring service providers. We are putting the Member States in an untenable position by preventing them from exercising any control. What can they possibly know about the working conditions in a Polish company that they know nothing about? My fourth point relates to the services covered. The scope of the directive has once again been extended, and will now affect some 6 000 occupations, and perhaps even more, given how ambiguous the text is. In conclusion, I think that, in this compromise that was wanted by all 25 Member States, the Court and the Commission are gaining an enormous amount of power to complete the internal market, without worrying about the social dumping that is crushing our workers and will continue to aggravate unemployment. The people have been deceived on the accession of Turkey and duped on the VAT affair, their rejection of a super-State has been scorned, and now they have been betrayed on the Bolkestein directive. Quite frankly, how many of us are now able to look the electorate in the eye?

In an attempt to obtain the consent of the people of France during the referendum on the European Constitution, the ‘Yes’ camp, particularly within the UMP, made them three promises: that the Bolkestein Directive would be withdrawn; that VAT would be lowered for the catering sector; and that the plan for Turkey to join the EU would be abandoned. The people of France are finally going to end up with Turkey, the Bolkestein Directive and an unchanged VAT rate. The compromise on which we are voting today is a seemingly watered down version of the original text, which includes, as a double whammy, full powers for the Commission and the Court of Justice to re-establish the initial text. How can Mr Toubon say that, by adopting this compromise, he hopes to ‘avoid the worst’? The worst would therefore mean there being no directive, but that was precisely the promise made to the people of France in 2005 by the UMP and the Head of State!

 Ladies and gentlemen, what a mish-mash! The few citizens who take an interest in our debates will find it very difficult to understand why, this afternoon, we are mixing up a debate on pollution in Ivory Coast with another on a judgment that tramples over the subsidiarity principle. The fact that the judgment of 13 September 2005 was issued on the subject of an environmental directive does not change the fact that it is actually worded as a judgment on the principle of the communitisation of criminal law. This is tantamount to a constitutional revolution, because, as we know, at least nine other competences are in the process of being absorbed by the European Union, with no treaty, including criminal law on immigration and intellectual property law. There certainly is pollution, ladies and gentlemen – the Court of Justice’s judicial pollution of the European treaties. In this confused and ill-thought-out judgment, there are no textual references and no clear legal principles. Far-fetched and poorly explained considerations of questionable relevance lead to a hasty and slipshod conclusion. We know how it works: fuzzy conclusions demand the indefinite extension of the European Union's competences, then justify the interpretation of the Commission, which, finally, legitimises the transfer of powers from the States to the Court. Those who, like us, were wary of the substantial extension of the EU's objectives in Article I-3 of the draft Constitution were quite right to be concerned. The Commissioners and the judges have no intention of bending to the will of the people, and have decided to disregard their refusal to ratify a draft Constitution that transferred criminal matters into the ordinary Community legislative procedure. This judgment is a distortion of the will of those who signed and ratified the European treaties. It is a judicial coup d'état. Ladies and gentlemen, we are coming up to some important deadlines. Our people are watching us and will soon be calling us to account. Will there be any sincere democrats here to stand up to this shameless tyranny?

We voted against the two resolutions proposed to us. They outlined, with certain nuances, the difficulty in controlling the entry and movement of illegal immigrants, but never mentioned the fact that this difficulty stems precisely from the abolition of national borders. The resolutions take up the idea, shared by Mr Sarkozy, of the complete abolition of unanimous voting in the field of justice and home affairs, that is to say the complete abolition of the Member States’ sovereignty on their own soil. This is one more example of European integration being used as a solution to the problem it presents. Those who, like the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are trying today in this Parliament to contain immigration are in reality creating more problems than they solve. We should not have accepted the Schengen Agreement with the abolition of permanent controls at internal borders and we should not have accepted the Treaty of Amsterdam or, rather, the communitisation of the bulk of the policies on asylum, visas and immigration, including the fight against illegal immigration. We have opened the floodgates to uncontrolled immigration and, at the same time, deprived the Member States of their powers, only to transfer them to an inevitably paralysed Union.

 Mr President, fellow Members, we have heard Mr Frattini complain about our not being able to protect Europe’s southern borders, rightly pointing out that an illegal immigrant who succeeds in getting into Spain or Italy can be in Lille or Hamburg within a day, and heard him propose, like Mr Sarkozy, that the right of veto be completely abolished. This is one more example of European integration being used as a solution to the problems it presents. Have not most of the parties represented in this House opened the floodgates to uncontrolled immigration by means of the Schengen agreements and the Treaty of Amsterdam, thereby depriving the Member States of their competence in this matter? The Commission is now freezing the readmission agreements between Member States and interfering in family reunification policies and even wishes to bring in 25 million additional immigrants to curb the population decline. No, ladies and gentlemen, it is not possible to takes turns in power for 30 years and then, as soon as the elections come along, make out that one is not responsible for the current situation. Moreover, we are also supposed to go further in the headlong flight towards federalism. Frankly, if you want to destroy European civilisation, just continue as you are.

We voted against this text. It levels a criticism at Turkey, which, when all is said and done, is very unfair: that of being Turkey, that is to say of not being European. What is the use of plying this country with recommendations and demands? The people of Europe do not want Turkey to join, because the evidence is right there in front of them: Turkey – and this is not intended as an insult to the country – is not part of the European family. It has its own culture, its own values and its own sphere of influence. That is the meaning behind the amendment that we have tabled on behalf of the Independence and Democracy Group. We must now put a stop to the hypocritical and devastating game of accession negotiations, which can only end in a major crisis, since the potential accession treaty has no chance of being ratified by the people, and particularly by the people of France, where the referendum procedure will be obligatory. Let us spare a thought today for our French fellow Members, who are suffering from a bout of full-blown schizophrenia. Even though they claim to be against Turkey’s accession, they vote, each year, in this House and in the French Parliament, in favour of Turkey’s receiving pre-accession appropriations, and they have welcomed within their own European party – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – observers from the AKP, the Islamic party led by Mr Erdogan.

 President Barroso, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report refers, quite rightly, to the principle of subsidiarity as the legal basis for issues relating to services of general interest. It has been only vaguely defined. We have moved from a substitution principle to a principle of delegation. For this reason, services of general interest can only be defined at the expense of particular circumstances and national needs. Once again, we have to lament the fact that the unmistakable warning sent to you by the French and Dutch people should be treated with such contempt. I would remind you that services of general interest are only of concern to the European Union from the very disputable point of view of competition. The freedom of Member States to define the duties they intend to entrust to public service, in accordance with the will of their people, is being seriously undermined in this instance. No, it is not appropriate for countries that, historically, do not have a culture of public services to prevent those that do have such a culture from having public services when they have deemed them necessary. If you respected the principle of subsidiarity in its true sense, you would admit that public services, essential to the life of our societies, should be defined, organised and managed as close to citizens as possible at national level. We believe that only a strong public power is capable of ensuring a future that is viewed not in terms of the mere quarterly profitability of shares, but over decades in the fields of education, health, transport, energy and the environment. (The President asked the speaker to conclude)
 The only rule we have need of is that of sovereignty, which means that each State should be free to decide on its public services and that public service obligations take precedence over Community competition law.

Mr President, someone is cruelly missing from this Chamber this evening, although he was here this afternoon. How can we tolerate the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that this crucial debate on the consequences of the judgment of the Court of 13 September 2005 is taking place in the absence of the main party involved, the Council itself? Was it the Council that imposed this agenda so as to avoid having to publicly acknowledge the profound meaning of its defeat on 13 September in Luxembourg? Allow me to act as its spokesperson this evening. Yes, the Council was defeated that day by a further judicial show of strength. Yes, despite the rejection of the ratification of the European Constitution that provided for it, the competence pillars have, in fact, just merged. There are no longer any intergovernmental powers in Europe. Yes, the Member States can see that an interpretation of the Treaties that they signed is being arbitrarily imposed on them. That is what the Chairman of the French Constitutional Council, Pierre Mazot, calls France’s vitiated consent. Yes, this uncontrolled communitisation of criminal law knows no bounds because, while it was at it, the Commission decided to annul nine framework-decisions, a move that, after the environment, will enable it to lay its hands on criminal law in relation to illegal immigration, to marine pollution and even to intellectual property. I ask you, ladies and gentlemen – and particularly the French Members among us – what purpose do our Interior and our Justice ministers now serve? On behalf of my group, I tabled Amendment 1, which is a very sensible amendment and one to which every independent Member could easily be won over. It is an alternative that simply calls on the Member States to regain control of the treaties that they sign. Yet, how many independent Members are there in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen?

Mr President, since the only natural place for political and democratic debate is at national level, coherent parties with a global programme have a place only within Member States. The democratic deficit of the European Union will only be made good through the representation of national parties having their own particular identity, parties that are accountable to the citizens who know them and understand them. The European political parties, virtually funded by the European Union, must be able to preserve their independence and not become yet another means of addressing European propaganda and communication to the electors. Thus, the European political parties must remain simply a means of cooperation between national political parties, an open forum in which each member is respected. On no account should they reflect, or become the means of conveying, some supposed European public opinion which does not exist and will not exist, because language differences are a fact and the European Union is a means and not an end in itself.

Mr President, in the town of Romans, in the department of Drôme, the unemployment rate stands at 18% – twice the French average – because the footwear sector there is devastated and traditional skills disappearing. This collapse is due to the anachronistic application of the Ricardian model underpinning your policy. The new international division of labour has encouraged low-wage countries to specialise in labour-intensive industries, while high-saving countries concentrate on very capital-intensive industries. Today, growth-starved capital is also leaving those countries. Thus, the countries of the European Union, which used to have a high level of productivity and high wages, are being surpassed by countries that are just as productive but that pay low wages. In order to prevent a fatal outcome, we must re-read the work of the liberal Maurice Allais, we must rediscover the virtues of the common external tariff of blessed memory and we must protect ourselves outside the Union in order to be free inside it. If we do not do so, then all of our labour-intensive industries will follow in the footsteps of the footwear industry.

Mr President, I refer to Rule 138 concerning translations. Amendment 1 tabled by the Independence and Democracy Group proposes an alternative draft resolution that heeds and respects our nations’ rejection of any super state and therefore of any constitution. The translation of this amendment, the English version in particular, distorts the sense of the original in several places. For example, where we refer to ‘the pursuit of European construction’, a politically neutral expression, the translation refers to ‘European integration’, an expression for the supranational process that we reject. It is no doubt a Pavlovian reflex that has contaminated many offices in this building, still not accepting that a different Europe is possible. I would therefore like to point out that only the original French version is authentic.

We congratulate you on your ability to make things clear. In fact, the case law demonstrated by the ‘Marks &amp; Spencer’ judgment of 13 December 2005 shows that the Court of Justice has a teleological take on the Treaties that leads it to go beyond its rights. We want our Assembly, taking its lead from your Presidency, to redefine the role of the Court of Justice and to limit the consequences of its decisions.

Mr President, the French delegation of the Independence and Democracy Group is in favour of promoting maritime transport. In the current legal context, maritime transport yields good results. In 2000, 41% of the bulk consignments transferred within Europe were transported via maritime transport, compared with 43% transported via road transport. Yet, do we need this port services directive in order to promote this effective mode of transport? The aim of this new proposal is to overcome the failure of the first package on port services, which was rejected by this very Parliament. This new proposal takes up the main points contained in the first arrangement. The scope remains the same, the list of services is identical and the promotion of competition remains excessive. The few changes affecting this text do nothing to improve it. The authorisations issued to the providers of port services genuinely give rise to suspicion. The burden of new procedures will give rise to a whole host of disputes, and the management costs will increase as a result of legal uncertainty. The authorisation periods do not take account of the long period of time required to justify significant investment decisions. This succession of patch-up jobs belies an impulsive move made without any serious impact study. The study published by the British Transport Ministry on 26 August 2005 even falls under the heading of aggravating circumstances: an increase in the ticket granting entry into the market and an allowance granted to large suppliers at the expense of small companies. Changes affecting self-handling are re-igniting criticism of social dumping. This crucial issue shows just how central the Bolkestein Directive continues to be to all of the Union’s arrangements. Therefore, despite Article 4 and the exclusion of transport services from the ‘Services’ Directive, we know that these are the kinds of ploys we are used to in this House. Yes, maritime transport needs specific and precise reforms. Yes, this directive is primarily designed to disguise a new and obvious failure on the part of the Union’s institutions. Yes, maritime transport needs sovereign States that make it clear how they stand. Consequently … (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 May, only a few days before the referendum on the European Constitution, the EU Presidency announced an imminent agreement on reduced VAT rates for the catering sector in France, rates that would decrease from 19.6% to 5.5%. In order to make people vote in favour of the Constitution, the French Government had boldly to confirm this promise throughout the entire campaign, a long-standing promise, in reality, since it had already featured in the programme of the Presidential candidate, Mr Chirac, in 2002, and even in 1995. Likewise, in its draft finance act for 2006, the French Government, gambling on an agreement at EU level, announced and provided for a one-year renewal of the reduced VAT rate for renovation work. It is clear that this two-faced promise fuels a permanent sense of uncertainty with regard to taxation, unsettling consumers and, above all, the professionals of the sectors concerned. Now that our people have rejected the superstate, has the time therefore not come to tell Europeans the truth? Seeking to do everything and anything with 25 Member States, no matter what the cost, has crippling effects. Has the time not come to envisage another kind of Europe: a ‘Variable-geometry’ and ‘Variable-geography’ Europe?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Council and the Member States argued before the Court, a teleological reading of the Treaties once again leads to the letter of them being overturned, not to say violated, especially Articles 135 and 280 of the EC Treaty and 29 et seq
 of the EU Treaty, which clearly reserve criminal competence for the Member States. Thus, without a treaty, without a mandate and against the wishes of the Member States and the Council, the Court of Justice and the Commission have agreed to use this judicial communitisation of criminal law to merge the pillars of competences within the Union. That was one of the objectives of the Constitutional Treaty which, if I may remind those of our fellow Members who still refuse to accept the fact, has been rejected and has become null and void under international law. The Commission has clearly lost no time in stepping into the breach this opened up. On 23 November last, it added to criminal environmental law an initial list of nine new criminal competences it was unilaterally removing from the Member States. This continued absorption of national competences is also reflected in the future European civil code, which is still being prepared, with no legal basis, by the Von Bar Group with a EUR 5 million subsidy from the European taxpayer. Are the supranational institutions using some mysterious hegemonic principle that says the nations do not matter or are an obstacle to be overcome, to take their revenge for the referenda of 29 May and 1 June? These judicial shows of strength are distorting the model of Europe that our countries agreed to. We are faced with what French Constitutional Council President Pierre Mazeaud feared at the start of the year: a serious defect of consent. I therefore want to say, quietly but solemnly, that those in this House who fail to respond to these shows of strength are committing an act against their governments, against their parliaments, against their constitutions, against the European treaties themselves and against the nations and are paving the way for renewed insurrections, not only electoral ones, against a Europe that is emphatically no longer their own.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the textile industry is in crisis. Two egocentric ideas are threatening it: the single-minded attitude that refuses to see what is wrong with the new international division of labour. Today, even the high-tech industries are leaving the continent. We must fight against this deindustrialisation of Europe and not surrender to this mirage of the tertiary sector above all. The other idea is that of the ideology of the EU which consists, in your view, Commissioner, in seeing this industry as a relict and China being forced to look outwards as a smooth transition. We must open our eyes if we are to save this industry. We must re-establish the principle of Community preference as provided for in the Treaty of Rome so that competition is not competition between social systems. We must re-establish a competitive monetary policy so that we can fight on an equal footing against the monetary dumping of the dollar and of the yuan. In the immediate future, let us encourage China to concentrate on supplying its internal market, let us re-establish the quotas according to the 2004 standards and let us not forget the poor textile-exporting countries that are the main victims of this irresponsible policy. Mr Mandelson said that ‘the EU is the most open economy in the world’. I will translate: ‘It is the least protected economy in the world’.

By formally opening accession negotiations with Turkey, the European Heads of State or Government will be taking a decision for which they will have to be answerable to the people and to history. The authorities of my country are, however, in possession of a clear mandate from the people they are supposed to represent: on 29 May 2005, the people of France rejected the European Constitution and the project of enlargement to include Turkey. Today, the representatives of the UMP party in this Parliament are worried about the dangers of an ‘autistic’ Europe and of the danger of a divorce between the people and the European project. What a revelation! Do they recall that they regularly voted in favour of the pre-accession credits for Turkey? Do they recall that, within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, they sit alongside the AKP, the Islamic party led by Mr Erdogan? Are they only aware that the person who holds the key to this affair is the most senior among them, Mr Chirac? This collective lie, which says that Turkey must enter the Union, is disgraceful, since each of them, in silence, is hoping that the other one will say ‘no’ and take responsibility for the breakdown. That is why, on behalf of the people of France, we solemnly address the President of the Republic and call on him to veto the opening of these negotiations.

At a time when several European countries are in the grip of the terrorist threat, it is unthinkable that the Member States should be called on to withdraw an initiative that is intended to ensure more effective cooperation, in order to ward off, trace, detect and pursue the perpetrators of terrorist acts and their accomplices. To reject this initiative solely on the grounds that it comes from the Member States and not from the Commission is irresponsible, given what is at stake: protecting the safety of our fellow citizens. Once again, this report is guided not by the interests of the general public, but by ideological considerations, with an attempt made, without revising the Treaties, to deprive the Member States of their powers more and more each day for the benefit of the Commission. Being unable to rely on the people in the wake of the French and Dutch referenda, the supranational institutions of the Union seem to have embarked on a quest, outside the Treaties, to gradually seize the Member States’ powers, following the example of the landmark ruling pronounced on 13 September 2005 by the Court of Justice, which precisely authorises the Commission to legislate on criminal matters. Finally, in the face of the terrorist threat, how useful are these delaying tactics based on a would-be breach of Community law, proportionality or the presumption of innocence? That is why we have voted against this report.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, rail issues are by their very nature of interest to all of those living in the European Union and all of its Member States. For a long time, geography determined the transport services on offer and nations’ policies. Today, technology and the construction of major infrastructures are enriching the sector and in their turn determining the future of economic and cultural exchanges. We have a role to play in this sector: building bridges between nations and promoting exchange. But not just any old exchange! We need an exchange that enriches national specificities, because the exchange has to be of a complementary nature to be justified and worthwhile. We are delighted to have texts promoting such genuinely free exchanges between sovereign peoples. Nevertheless, reading the three reports that have been tabled today, it seems to us that three simple principles, governing how nations are ordered, have been disregarded. The first principle that does not seem to us to have been respected in every case is that of subsidiarity. In the transport sector, as elsewhere, we think that everything that can be done at the level closest to the action should be done at that level, and only what is absolutely necessary will be left to the higher level. We therefore do not understand why the Sterckx report, which rightly cites the international convention COTIF, hastens to encumber the text with a surfeit of details that ought to be dealt with under this convention, a convention which we ought by the way to be relaunching. In this particular case, extending the rights of those with reduced mobility is the exception, as it is vital to do so. But this imperative could be the subject of a simple injunction of principle to COTIF. Furthermore, why, by the same token, in Mr Savary’s excellent report on staff training, is a clearer distinction not drawn between the training of drivers on the one hand and that of train crews on the other? Why not simply certify different competences, since the professions are radically different? The second principle that we feel has been abused is the respect for sovereignty. We cannot allow the fact that transport services need to be organised at international level to become a Trojan Horse to invade national law. The amended Sterckx report systematically substitutes the expression ‘all rail passengers’ for the notion of ‘international rail passengers’. We cannot agree to national law being made subordinate to international law in this way. The third principle that is disregarded is that of prudence. There is a lack of prudence when, in Mr Jarzembowski’s report, Amendment 8 proposes a period of only three years to implement significant changes. We have to give these things time: too hasty and you are doomed to failure. There is also a lack of prudence in the Sterckx report in that it tries to deal with everything in one single dossier: with disability, ticketing, compensation in the case of accidents and penalties in the case of substandard services. Dealing with everything means losing relevance. A lack of prudence is also displayed in the failure to state clearly that the railways should serve the needs above all of freight and in particular long-distance freight. Similarly there is a lack of prudence in the failure to first include these proposals in the report on very competitive modes of transport. In conclusion, we acknowledge the painstaking and commendable work done by the Commissioner, but once again we remain doubtful about such an avalanche of legal provisions and the effectiveness of this Parliament’s methods.

 I am delighted that our committee is unanimous in its support for this project. It is vital for: - technological reasons: this is an innovative project and is an improvement on the guarantee of services provided by the US-owned GPS. - economic reasons: the sector needs to retain an appropriate level of activity. There will be a large number of direct or related jobs. - strategic reasons: Galileo improves the autonomy of our defence systems. - political reasons, because the project keeps the EU to its purpose. The EU has limited itself to creating the conditions for the emergence of the necessary new activities. The amendment requiring the concession holder to repay the investment illustrates this spirit. The autonomy of nations is strengthened. The PRS goes in this direction and enables each country to gain access to a technology that would be unattainable for them on their own. This cooperation also includes countries outside the EU. In conclusion, this project shows that true cooperation does not need a Constitution. This is a good project; let us hope that it will soon find its place in the budgetary plan.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the concern for preserving the fishery resources in the Mediterranean is completely legitimate. It is indeed necessary to preserve a rich and diverse environment and essential food resources for future generations. Sustainable management of the marine ecosystem is essential. Of all the living creatures populating this planet, there is, however, one that has not only duties but also rights. I am referring to human beings. The regulation submitted to us presents a compromise, the intention of which I certainly understand: it is a compromise not only between the different sovereign nations that make up Europe, but also between the ways in which the environment is used and conserved. However, Amendment 10, tabled by our rapporteur, directly affects a Mediterranean fishing activity that is traditional to France, the tonnaille
. This is an ancient fishing technique, specific to the French Mediterranean, in which bluefin tuna are caught using an anchored surface net. My fellow Members, be aware that, by approving this amendment, you will be signing the death warrant of 1 200 jobs directly and indirectly linked to this activity. On the ground, there is incomprehension, as well as legitimate anger. For years, fishermen in this sector have made significant efforts, particularly with regard to protecting cetaceans, in order to limit the impact of their activity on the ecosystem. Their accidental catches are now only residual. Scientific studies show that this method of fishing is one that respects its environment. I know that this compromise has been difficult to reach, but I appeal to the Commission, the Council and especially the French Government. What are a few extra days of negotiation compared with the distress of 300 families and an entire region? What weight will the argument regarding the compromise package carry, and that of Pandora’s box, which should certainly not be opened in France, where public opinion is increasingly aware that Brussels is out of touch with the reality of people’s lives? Let us not forget that 80% of fishing in the Mediterranean is of an artisanal nature, so why should we always favour the remaining 20%? Mrs Fraga Estévez, Members, reopen the negotiations in order to save these jobs! Commissioner Borg has just informed us that he refuses to approve our Amendment 34, on the grounds that Article 7(2), on which our amendment is founded, is based on a classification that does not correspond to the text. In my opinion, that is a matter of legal quibbling that concerns the detail of what the Commissioner and his services must regulate, but does not take account of the basis of the amendment, namely the protection of fishermen’s rights, which the amendment must crucially ensure is respected. With this in mind, I call on you to vote against Amendment 10 tabled by our rapporteur, whom I nevertheless congratulate on the tireless work that she has carried out, and I call on you to vote in favour of our Amendment 34. On behalf of the fishermen whom you will save, I thank you.

French representatives of the Independence and Democracy Group have voted against the Van Orden and Moscovici reports for several reasons, which have to do with their implications for Bulgaria and Romania, member countries of the International Francophone Agency, and long-standing friends of France. We think too much of them to make them fall prey to the Eurocratic trap, which promises much, offers little and takes the most important thing – sovereignty. The Soviet-style ‘limited sovereignty’ imposed by the EU is, moreover, resisted by some prominent citizens of these countries, who refuse to see their nation bribed by EU subsidies, and who call for the support of our no vote. It will be possible, outside the iron collar of the EU, to achieve with them a Greater Europe founded on cooperation. This cooperation will be tailored to the interests of each participant, in serving the freedom of the people. On the other hand, Romania and Bulgaria’s entry ensures an unbroken territorial line towards Turkey, which favours the latter’s accession. This would complete the EU’s development as a culturally divided agglomerate, which is powerless, if not politically enslaved. This vote does not, therefore, deny the European character of Bulgaria and Romania, which have always been European countries.

 The Commission’s reform of the generalised system of preferences has been stepped up a gear, apparently because of the urgent need to support the economies of those countries hit by the tsunami of 26 December 2004. The plan is for the new system to come into force on 1 April. In the aftermath of the tsunami disaster, European citizens and States proved that their generosity could be counted upon. Yet the Commission intends to make sectors of European industry that are experiencing difficulties, in particular the textile industry, pay a heavy price for this generosity. The textile industry has been hit hard by unfair competition from China, and this competition will only get worse. Yet the industry provides a livelihood for 2.5 million people in Europe, and generates turnover of EUR 230 billion. The Commission intends to set a threshold of 12.5% of Community imports of these products before a country loses its entitlement to GSP, which will encourage competition from the Indian textile industry, as the latter will benefit from reduced duties. This industry is regarded as competitive under the current GSP, which sets a threshold of 10% before customs duties are introduced, or which in other words enables balanced competition despite differences in salaries and welfare conditions. Making one sector of the economy pay the price of state aid flies in the face of liberal thinking. Such a move, which would make hundreds of thousands of people in Europe redundant, would also be antisocial.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the automobile industry is an industry which, more than any other, is dependent upon policies laid down at European level. I should like to draw your attention to two key facts, before making two proposals. Firstly, the automobile industry is experiencing near-deflationary conditions, as well as being exposed to a competition which is subject to almost no restrictions. Secondly, it is one of the mainstays of European industry, generating two million jobs directly and over eight million jobs indirectly, as well as accounting for 24% of research and development. It provides a firm guarantee for Europe’s place in the global economy, and yet this industry is under threat. Rapid and decisive action must be taken, and my proposals are as follows. In the light of the Commission statement, it should be stressed that, since enlargement, only three of the 25 Member States can truly be said to be major forces in the automobile industry, namely France, Germany and Italy. It is therefore imperative that the other Member States and the Commission understand the significance of this industrial sector for all of Europe. In particular, the European Union should not impose any additional regulatory constraints which are not in strict proportion to actual environmental and safety needs. Our prime concern should be to maintain the competitiveness of the European automobile industry. By cooperating closely with this industry, we must now move away from the drive to reduce polluting emissions, a task which we are close to achieving, towards a new priority of reducing CO2 emissions. The Commission drafts on designs and models are another cause for concern with regard to the future and competitiveness of our automobile industry. The reason why the automobile industry is one of the leading industrial sectors in terms of resources allocated to research and development is because it is possible to obtain legal protection for the results of this research. Those within the Commission who support an unbridled liberalism should therefore be made to see sense, and our industry must be able to pursue its efforts to modernise and to improve competitiveness without others gaining from the fruits of its labours, in so doing jeopardising jobs in European industry.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the two parliamentary committees have initiated this debate.  Since its signature nearly ten years ago, the Marrakesh Agreement has resulted in fundamental changes to the nature of the relations entered into by the European Union, and by France in particular, with their developing country partners. Today we have a new Commission communication presenting a project for reforming and improving the Generalised System of Preferences. It should firstly be noted that the Generalised System of Preferences has been a battlefield between two world views: on the one hand, that of a Europe – and more specifically of France – which is committed to its developing country partners and conscious of its responsibilities and historical ties, and, on the other hand, that of a Europe which believes that exposure to global free trade should be the only real means of economic and social development. I fear that this new Commission communication merely serves as a smoke screen to disguise the simple fact that it renounces our previous commitments in favour of those arising from our participation in the World Trade Organisation. This is what is euphemistically known as a WTO-compatible system. In reality, and more generally, this House and the Council have allowed the Commission to pursue two contradictory policies at the same time, namely an external trade policy of absolute free trade, and a policy of providing development aid to privileged partners. If we did not wish to allow the WTO to dismantle the Lomé Convention systematically, instrument by instrument, the Council should have acted as a supervisor and recognised authority, in order to provide coherent definitions and a determined defence of clear and long-term strategies, including all external policy instruments, in broad fields of common interest such as development. This fundamental contradiction affects all of the policies which we intend to pursue together. How can we ask our fishermen to reduce pressure on fish stocks, at the same time as signing trade agreements with countries which do not wish to agree to make the same efforts? How can we impose environmental standards, social constraints and solidarity commitments on our companies, while exposing them to a competition which bears none of these burdens? Finally, how can we ask our partners from the South to believe in the long-term commitment of the EU and its Member States to their development, if, with advantages that are now barely appreciable, we expose them, reform by reform, to the forces of the single global market? I am speaking on behalf of the French delegation of my group. We are in no way opposed to the market, and we believe in free enterprise, in initiative and in individual responsibility, but we also believe that the State should play its role as regulator and strategist, both to protect its citizens and in the interests of its poorest international partners, as in the absence of this the market is nothing but a jungle. Given that the prosperity of our continent was mainly established in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries under relatively protected conditions, how can we demand of our partners from the South that they expose their nascent economies to the four winds? Maybe the young shoots of developing countries require assistance in some form from us on a provisional basis. Although admittedly imperfect, our GSP system must be kept in place. I also fear that, as in a great many other cases, the Commission proposal is not based on any impact study or evaluation of the system as a whole. I hope that this House will vote on a detailed proposal, but we must demand, ladies and gentlemen, that this only take place if we have been informed of the consequences which this reform will have.
