 Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, the European Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs fully support the aim of creating a single payment area in the European Union. There continue to be very significant national barriers in the form of different national regulations, national legislation and national supervision; even today, these make it difficult to create a single internal market for bulk payments, which would ultimately benefit the citizen. We took the first steps in this direction some time ago with cross-border transfer fees. That, too, required an initiative at European level. We also support, for example, the introduction of a single direct debit system, which has not so far been possible. Imagine, it is now possible for a citizen to travel to another state, but he still cannot have payments debited at home, but he has to choose a national bank to do it. The question is, how do we achieve this objective? I am a strong advocate of the approach of incremental legislation in line with the principle of subsidiarity, with self-regulation in first place, that is self-regulation by the banks. We have the European Payments Council – which can, should, and indeed must set the parameters for the creation of the technical interfaces for cross-border activity, for example. Then, also with subsidiarity in mind, I would prefer the next steps to be taken in directives and only enact in regulations what is really necessary to do uniformly. I would also like to sound a warning to the industry here, since it is itself always talking about self-regulation: these requirements will also have to be complied with and corresponding standards created without undue delay. Consumer protection presents a greater problem in this Commission document. It contains some ideas which in my view go far beyond our objective, and I have the impression that there are some people in the Commission – let me make clear that I do not mean you, Commissioner Bolkestein – who have lost sight of the idea of citizens taking responsibility for themselves. They suggest that the bank should in future be liable for a basic transaction. For example, if customers buy something over the Internet and the purchase is void, they want their money back, and if they cannot turn to the supplier, they should be able to turn to the bank, which had nothing to do with the basic transaction. I am sure things like that can be settled by the market – and you are an advocate of the market, after all – by having products that provide safeguards; a fundamental liability of the banks in such cases should be rejected, however, as should the proposal that cardholder’s liability be limited to EUR 150 when the card is lost, regardless of how they have behaved. If they go away on holiday, discover on setting out that they have lost their card, and report it three weeks later, the cardholder’s liability will still be limited to EUR 150. I think we should give a little more protection to people who act responsibly than to those who act irresponsibly. I am, however, pleased to welcome the fact that the Commission has taken up the idea of establishing a single EU-wide telephone number that can be called if a card is lost – a short number that is easy to remember and that the citizens can dial quickly. I would also like to stress that the creation of a single payment area should not result in national structures that are working well and efficiently being made less economic. We must not go about it in a way that is detrimental to operational national systems. Coming back to consumer protection, however, may I appeal to you, Mr Bolkestein, in the ongoing discussions within the Commission, to speak up for mature and responsible citizens and see that responsibility is left with them. The Lisbon objectives of becoming the most innovative and fastest-growing region in the world are held up to us repeatedly. Everyone is brandishing the slogan ‘less bureaucracy’. Mr Bolkestein, the text we have before us should be judged by whether it creates more bureaucracy or makes life easier for banks and citizens in the single European Union.

 Madam President, Commissioner, the adoption of both directives today is a welcome development. For a start, I am glad that the acceptance of the directives in this form means that two directives that are significant in terms of the Financial Services Action Plan have been adopted before this Parliament has run its course. It is important that we have managed, in the life of this Parliament, before the elections, and before enlargement, to lay the foundation stone of an integrated financial market that will add to Europe’s appeal, all the more so in comparison with the US. Secondly, I am glad that we have got this far, primarily largely thanks to Parliament, along with the Commission. The compromises and guidelines arrived at by Parliament at first reading demonstrated the goodwill of everyone concerned, among whom I would particularly single out Mrs Villiers, who succeeded, by means of a dialogue that disregarded party and national divisions, in finding a way forward that ended up being acceptable to the Member States. I regret the way in which the Member States repeatedly showed, right to the end, how little they are willing and able to pursue a shared objective. One of the things the investment services directive is about is more competition between the systems, which differ within the EU. This is about more competition, along with transparency, pricing, and protection for consumers. If we are to build Europe, the Heads of State or Government must come to realise that this cannot be a matter of one system prevailing over another. On one side there are the big investment banks; on the other, the smaller banks, the savings banks and cooperative banks. I think we in this House have done a good job, both in terms of its substance and of the time it has taken. I want to say something brief about the transparency directive, namely that I am glad – although I take a rather different line from the Commission on this – that we have not got the rules on quarterly reporting that had been proposed, which I believe would have added little value in relation to the extra effort and additional bureaucracy. I therefore believe that adopting these two directives this week, and within the life of this Parliament, will add up to a good piece of work on our part for Europe as a financial marketplace.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr Katiforis, whom, for a start, I warmly thank for the report on the future assessment of rating agencies. What is this actually about? It is a fact that rating agencies have, in the capital market, a very great deal of power and influence over enterprises. Upgrading or – in particular – downgrading is significant for an enterprise, in that it makes for major problems with the raising of capital, financial problems, and that does of course have indirect effects on jobs. Rating agencies, though, also assess countries; in Germany, for example, they assess the Federal states. It follows that the upgrading and downgrading of German federal states has effects on the taxpayer. I am not making this point by way of criticism, but only as an observation. There are three rating agencies in the market; even though I am a defender of competition and would very much welcome it if they were to be joined by more, I think that an administrative, public solution would be the wrong one. If anything, the creation of any more rating agencies, or at any rate, of a European one, should be in response to the market, but all attempts to do so to date have been unsuccessful. If we take into account the power that the rating agencies have, and our tendency, in legislating on financial markets, towards ever more regulation and supervision, then we have to give some thought to how we are to handle them in future. It is for this reason that I regard Mr Katiforis’ report as very important, in that it is the first in Europe to give attention to this topic. It is also important that Europe should do so. I would describe all three of the existing rating agencies as being predominantly Anglo-Saxon. Not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with that; but there are, after all, different financial structures within the European Union and around the world, with different rules, and not every rule that works on one side of the Atlantic must likewise be applicable 
on the other. That is why I see it as highly significant that we should make the attempt at the European level. In so doing, we should not give so much attention to what the Americans are doing in this field, for – after all – rating agencies also want to do business in this part of the world. All this we have to consider in the context of Basel II, in which rating – whether internal or external – will increasingly apply in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises. It will become normal, and the quintessential difference between external and internal rating will be that internal rating will, in the Member States, be subject to financial supervision, whereas external rating will not. What is at issue is whether we can carry on in future with only internal rating being supervised, while external rating is not. My main reason for raising this point is that I am told, by people in industry and in the financial sector, that businesses themselves find it very difficult to get the relevant information about their own rating, so one can scarcely speak in terms of a normal customer relationship between enterprises and rating firms. This makes it important that we should now demand that the Commission should analyse this issue, do some work on it, say precisely how things currently stand, and make proposals. That is why I very largely share Mr Katiforis’ concerns. The outcome should, however, be left open; we should not already be calling for registration and supervision, which can be left to the end of the process. We can, though, aim to get the rating agencies to give an undertaking, which would include a commitment to transparency, and which the Commission should take as a basis for its work. This process could well involve the rating agencies making their own proposals. I regard it as a matter of urgency – as does the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – that we should get this process underway now, that we should monitor it with a critical eye, and that the Commission should submit its proposals in the middle of next year.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we have just heard the USA declare that they want to make a massive commitment to space and again invest a great deal of money in it: settlements on the moon, a mission to Mars – pictures of which we see almost daily; this, I believe, is where Galileo is a very important and good sign for Europe’s economic and technological future. I am also looking ahead to this year’s European elections. People are always asking us in what ways Europe is benefiting them, and Galileo enables us to give them an example of how European forces can combine – for only together can we achieve such objectives – in the spheres of business and technology, in a useful way that benefits the future of the Europe in which we share. The problems have been described, and it is now urgently necessary that we make headway on the problems with implementation, including the ones that involve the Americans. A large number of obstacles have been overcome. Parliament has been constant in its support for the Commission, the Council has played its part, and now is the time to decide on the tenders. We have to waste no time in installing the system, so that we can work with it, and we have to create the right framework conditions, especially in the structures. This is where I wish to address a point that I see as important. When deciding on the future structures of Galileo, which we will be debating in this House, it is necessary that these should be effective, but it is equally necessary that Parliament should retain its share of responsibility and not allow this dossier to be taken out of its hands. Although I would ask that, when we come to discuss this, we should perhaps get more support from the Commission, I think that we have, together, demonstrated that Europe, the European Parliament, is united in its pursuit of this objective. Commissioner, this House has always been behind you, so in this matter too, we should make common cause in seeing to it that responsibility remains with Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Herzog for his cooperation. Although our different views on policy made working together difficult, we managed together to get the report underway. How did we first get on to this topic? The Commission alone possesses decision-making powers in respect of services of general interest – it has had in recent years an increasing tendency to take up these matters – and also as regards lawmaking in connection with competition law. Particularly with the constitutional treaty in mind, we were of the opinion that this was an area in which Parliament should gain greater competence. It was for that reason that we, too, originally favoured a framework directive. When debating the framework directive, though, we certainly have to ask ourselves questions about its substance too. Can we resolve the problems with competition law? The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats came to the conclusion that the framework directive was inherently unsuited to doing that. The fact is that those who advocate it must ask themselves, over and over again, what a framework directive of this sort is meant to contain. Underlying the debate on services of general interest is, on the one hand, European law on competition in the internal market, and, on the other, the way in which ‘services of general interest’ are defined, by way of subsidiarity, in the Member States or even at the regional and local level. Not under any circumstances do we want services of general interest defined at European level in the future, be it in a framework directive or in the constitutional treaty. We are in favour of competence and responsibility at the local level, where competition can be introduced through tendering, in cooperation with the private sector. The EU of the future, though, with its 25 Member States, will be too diverse for us to lay down at the European level what this expression means. That is why we say ‘no’ to a framework directive and ‘yes’ to local competence, particularly when it comes to the supply of water. This is where the Commission should start by putting before us evidence for competition being a good thing in postal services, public local passenger transport and in other areas such as energy. It is particularly with France in mind that much lost ground has to be made up, and you, Commissioner Lamy, should resolve these problems before tackling any new projects.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently devoting a great deal of effort, and attaching a great deal of weight, to discussion of a new constitutional treaty, whereby we provide ourselves with a new legal framework for the future, at the same time as we do this, the larger countries demonstrate their indifference to the law as it stands. I hope you will not mind if a Bavarian like myself draws a parallel. At the time of the Austrian elections, when the coalition came into being, we accused this law-abiding country of illegality and sought to use all our powers to get our own way, and the same is happening now. The larger countries are demonstrating that European law is of no interest to them. I cannot do other than encourage the Commission to subject what has happened to critical scrutiny, including by their lawyers, because the Council has not only rejected the Commission proposal – as it was entitled to do – but has also disregarded the Commission and simply set new parameters. This is not something that the Council is competent to do and so I cannot do other than offer the Commission encouragement. Of course, the way the big boys play the game within the European Union has a seriously prejudicial effect on the accession countries, who, as we are aware, will, all ten of them, followed by another two, be signing up to the euro, and all the while we have had one debate after another about the need to keep to the criteria. On what arguments will the Commission or the Council rely in future when telling these countries that they have to stick to the criteria? We ourselves do not, so we can expect that they will do likewise. The only thing I can actually do is give the Commission my backing. This is where the Commission must proceed with rigour and consistency, and let me issue a warning against negotiating a new Pact; the current situation in Europe being what it is, any new Pact would not be worthy of the name, but would end up as a hotchpotch of wishful thinking and aspirations towards flexibility that bear no relation whatever to what the economy demands. Europe is paying the price for Germany’s failure to do its homework over the past few years, and, at the end of the day, what we are aiming for is to keep the European single currency as a guarantee of economic stability. Thank you.

 Mr President, on behalf of the CSU, I too would like to voice support for Mr Trichet. This is due firstly to his professional competence and secondly to his personal qualities, for he will continue the tradition established by Mr Duisenberg. Although my highly esteemed colleague Mrs Villiers criticised Mr Trichet on the grounds that he did not have anything new to say, that is precisely what we are looking for. We want him to stand for continuity as the head of the ECB. This applies especially to the ECB’s core tasks – low inflation, a commitment to the ECB’s independence, and the struggle to uphold the Stability Pact. In this context, I especially hope that, as a Frenchman, he will deal critically with his home country. I also hope that the two Commissioners who are our guests here in plenary today, Mr Solbes and Mr Bolkestein, will fight to uphold the Stability Pact. Sweden showed us how the wrong budgetary policy in the Member States can influence the vote. What I really do not like about this debate is the constant criticism of the ECB. The ECB is being held responsible for meeting the Lisbon objectives. The main responsibility for meeting the Lisbon objectives lies not with the ECB or indeed with the Commission. They can both contribute to the process, but the chief responsibility lies with the Member States, and a great deal of time has been lost here because Member States have not done their homework. I would ask all of you who regularly hold the ECB responsible and voice criticism of it to be equally or even more critical of the Member States’ failures. I think that would take us much further forward. (Applause)

Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur. The road has been long and, in parts, an arduous one, but we have now found a compromise that reflects the whole House, that reflects opinion, and we should do our best to ensure that, in this week’s vote, the compromise as such is no longer challenged, but that there are only editorial changes to be made. We all accept that in future there will be competition between the different trading platforms, competition between stock markets and banks. On the other hand, we cannot disregard specific criteria, for example, that in competition the same conditions apply to banks as do to markets. What that means is that, if I take markets as sources of prices – of meaningful market prices – then this cannot be allowed to lead to liquidity being damaged in future and markets no longer being meaningful. As for transparency, we must ensure that the market is transparent for all as a place where prices emerge, and that everyone can understand how prices evolve there. Supply and demand must be maintained. This is what our laborious discussions achieved, and also for pre-trade transparency. We gave some points to the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) and we will listen attentively to what advice the CESR gives us. I see it as crucial that there are no winners and no losers in this discussion. Neither the City of London nor any other financial centre in Europe has won. Also we cannot say that the markets or the investment houses should have won, but everyone should be in this market together in the future, in order then to attract customers with the best offer. From a German point of view it is also important for me that the market structure should take national factors into account. I would, therefore, also ask that you give broad support to the two amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats so that small dealers in Germany are still protected. Thank you, Mr President.

Mr President, Commissioner, it is expected that the Basel Committee will, this autumn, come to a decision on the equity capital of banks in the future. It is certain that we will follow with a very critical eye the USA’s plans for transposing this into law in the future, and that we will, of course, come to our own conclusions at European level. If, though, the decision is taken in the autumn, it is envisaged that we will begin the lawmaking process next year. This report concentrates on small and medium-sized enterprises, as Basel II has the objective of making the international financial markets more stable, an objective shared by all. The fallout from Basel II must not, however hit those who had no part in destabilizing the financial markets – in particular the small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union, who, as is constantly reiterated, form the backbone of our economy and are the only means whereby we may be brought out of economic crisis. There have been calls for some considerable time for a study, and this makes it all the more important that it should be produced by the time a proposal for a directive is put forward, so that then the relevant conclusions may be drawn as regards the legislation. I would now like to explain a number of the main points in my report that I see as very important. The first is the issue of the legislation. I take a very critical view of the way we are acquiring more and more ‘soft law’, by which I mean legislation in international bodies that enjoy no democratic legitimacy. This is no criticism of the work they do, but of the way in which they do it. If Basel II were the only one, one might be able to overlook this, but we are ending up with more and more bodies like Basel II, for example the one on international accounting standards, in which experts get together and formulate standards that are then put before Parliament and the Commission in the expectation that we will transpose them into law without much in the way of correction. The only way we, as responsible politicians, can respond to this process is in the negative. We have to turn our minds to a more transparent process, one that influences the way these bodies are composed. Although I do not believe it to be necessary that we should, in the plenary or in committee, discuss every point of detail, we must, being responsible politicians, acquire greater influence. In any case, the European elections are coming up next year, and, back home, they will be asking all of us why we took this decision. This leads me to my second comitological point. It is quite clear to me too that Basel II is not a typical Lamfalussy process, as the lawmaking process will find us sharing in decisions on the annexes. The Lamfalussy process will, however, be used, as we will at that stage be determining which annexes will be amended by which procedure. The same applies here too; this is not to make a general criticism of the Lamfalussy process, but there are two points that must first be clarified. One – the strengthening of the law, the right of recall – is a matter for the Convention on the Constitution, and the second is, of course, a critical observation. Does Lamfalussy work in the way its creators thought it would, or is there still room for improvement? So much, for a start, for the fundamental principles! So far, much has been achieved; there is the million-euro ceiling, which we demand should be adjusted in line with inflation; we have got internal and external rating – where we will certainly have to see to it that smaller banks do not have to face the hurdles of excessive bureaucracy; the 0.2% granularity criterion must disappear, and we have to consider procyclicality. We are calling for a study to re-examine this point, and in greater detail, before the legislation enters into force. How, in future, will start-up-companies in this area be treated? At European level, we will certainly have urgent need of partial use, 
which Basel II has hitherto rejected. It is these things that we demand of Basel, and if the Basel Committee does what we want it to do, we will be able to adopt the rules without making major changes to them. If, though, it does not do so, we will introduce the necessary flexibility at European level. Basel does, though, present opportunities, such as rating for small and medium-sized enterprises to give them a clear idea of the state of their operations, although here it will be necessary for the banks to allow themselves enough time to explain rating, to work with small and medium-sized enterprises and to support their further development. We will, of course, also have to do our homework at national level. In my own country, people are always talking about small and medium-sized enterprises having a tradition of weak equity capital. Please bear in mind that the weak equity capital of small and medium-sized enterprises is not one of the traditions that I, as a Bavarian, see as a good thing; on the contrary, it results from a misguided fiscal policy over the last few decades. It is now time for the appropriate corrections to be made back home. Basel II is to be transposed in 2006 or 2007. This is a realistic goal if we work at it, but we do not hold to it dogmatically; in other words, we reserve to ourselves the right to carry out the scrutiny on which a decision will depend. (Sustained applause)

 Mr President, I hope my question is addressed to the Council, because Member States still have authority over matters of foreign and security policy. I would like to point out at this juncture that although GALILEO is primarily a private-sector project, and one in which we also want to have private-sector services, in a common project for a stronger European Union foreign and security policy we should be setting the course now to ensure that in future infrastructure services and information services will be available and can be purchased at European level. Up to now, unfortunately, we have not had the infrastructure. We talk about a rapid reaction force, and in order to be able to act in future in the area of foreign policy, we must be able to rely on GALILEO. This is why a line should be made available here, and this is certainly something that is also in the interests of the Council.

 Madam President, Commissioner, we have heard a great many noble objectives being expressed in today's debate. We have heard about full employment and social security, and there is undoubtedly a broad consensus here in this House. The only question is: how do we achieve it? The EU is responsible for competition, the internal market, the euro, for areas where there are common objectives and a common need for action, and I think that is the right approach. However, I am a fervent opponent of the plan to coordinate economic policies at European level in future. In fact, I would be happy if the things that do fall within European competence actually worked out in practice, which brings me to two points. Here we are today, with yet another debate about the Lisbon strategy; my astonishment mounts from day to day whenever the Commission talks about this strategy and claims that it is continuing to pursue this objective. Perhaps in many years' time, we will talk about how Europe had a dream. We should look at ourselves self-critically for once and ask how on earth we are ever to achieve this goal. I would like to focus on two points here, and I am particularly interested in tangible action. Firstly, I expect the Commission, in future, to identify exactly where the homework needs to be done at national level. In other words, it must put its finger on the weak spots, and do so promptly. This issue has already been addressed on numerous occasions. The second point that I see as being very important is that the Commission should not undermine its own actions in future. We have Commissioner Monti who is responsible for competition, we have Commissioner Bolkestein who deals with the internal market, we have Commissioner Liikanen who is responsible for business and who says what form it must take in Europe, we have Commissioner de Palacio, and we have Commissioner Solbes, who regularly tells us which structural reforms are needed in Europe and the Member States, and I support that, I am not criticising. However, where I do criticise these Commissioners and what annoys me is when the Commission itself produces proposals which conflict with this Lisbon objective, which conflict with the aim of deregulating the labour market. I am thinking, for example, of the directive on precontractual employment relationships and the form that they will have to take in future and also the discrimination which will occur if an entrepreneur – even if he has not yet signed a contract – fails to keep his eye on the ball and ends up being sued because the Commission did not think to build in a reversal of the burden of proof here. I have written to these Commissioners. Mr Solbes, you have answered on behalf of the Commission. Unfortunately, your answer was not specific enough. What I want from the Commission is a shift away from the principle that each Commissioner conducts the affairs of his or her department independently along the lines of ‘I'll do my thing and you do yours’. Please stop the Commission from producing any more directives like this, which, in practice, conflict with the objectives that you yourselves have set for the Member States. This brings me to my second point, namely the Stability and Growth Pact. On the one hand, I would like to thank you, for at a time when criticism of this issue is being voiced in the Commission, you have kept the flag flying and ultimately campaigned resolutely for the Stability and Growth Pact. However, here too, I expect you to put your finger on the weak spots clearly and promptly in future. The last time you appeared before us in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the opinions you expressed on Germany were quite opaque. I asked you this: ‘Are you assuming that what is planned is adequate? Are you assuming that the deficit criterion will not be exceeded this year? Are you assuming that the target will be achieved in 2004 or 2006?’ We all knew that this would not be the case. Here, your task would be to speak up promptly and send out a clear warning signal so that no one is surprised when the target is not achieved after all. False expectations are being awakened, and you have a responsibility to ensure compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking today on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to submit my opinion on the issue of comitology. In so doing – and this was of course mentioned at the end of the previous intervention – I am focusing in particular on the Lamfalussy process and the Lamfalussy procedures for legislation creating the internal market in financial services. Like the Lamfalussy Group, our aim is to produce legislation in this sector that is close to the market and practicable; that is what all of us want and are working for. However, we must of course take a close look at what form the procedures may take in the future. Precisely in our role as Parliament we need to ask ourselves whether the future procedures also have sufficient democratic legitimacy, because of course we are also getting increasing numbers of so-called soft laws, that is legislation at international level. I only need to mention Basel II or the International Accounting Standards, which will soon become law in Europe once the necessary steps have been taken by the European Commission and after adoption in the Council and Parliament. If in the future all of this were to happen in a comitology procedure, with a framework directive only giving general instructions, we would have a basic problem of legitimacy, and Parliament reserves the right to have a say on these very important issues in the future. For this reason I can only support the rapporteur, Mr Corbett. It is vital for us in the European Parliament to retain our influence at European level. This does not mean that we also wish to discuss the technical details in the plenary or in committee. That is not our point. But if we feel that provisions are heading in the wrong direction it is vital that we be able to say so, and for this to happen it is essential that the constitution being drafted by the Convention give us a right to call back in the future, which means that if we are not happy with something we can recall it, change its focus and correct it. That is why it is essential for the Commission and the Convention to support us here so that we can have the relevant provisions added.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that we are able to have a debate today on this important subject, for the Spring Summit is about to be held, at which, every three years, we can give renewed consideration to how Europe can become the most competitive and the most innovative region in the world. The importance of consumer protection as a subject is not a matter of dispute. What we have to do is get to grips with how we put it into practice. I will appeal to the Commission's rigour in saying that I am, though, firmly convinced that consumer protection does not run counter to these criteria. On the one hand, for example, we are pursuing the objective of a reduction in bureaucracy in Europe. I get the impression, though, that we are creating ever more bureaucracy, thus taking ourselves that extra bit further away from the goal of reducing it. I would also like to take this debate as an occasion to address the image that we have of consumers and the public. I am a great believer in transparency in the field of consumer protection – by which I mean giving the public the information they need – but, at the end of the day, politics must not, piecemeal, deprive the public of their rights and responsibilities. I am referring here to a quite specific example from an area with which I have been concerned, namely the Consumer Credit Directive, by means of which the Commission is accomplishing a shift that I regard as not entirely justifiable, by abandoning a standard of minimal harmonisation and mutual recognition in favour of maximum harmonisation. This it is achieving, for example, by adopting an inverse burden of proof for banks, which will no longer be required to check with the utmost rigour to what extent a borrower is able to repay the credit. It goes without saying that this is in the interest of everyone who gives credit and of everyone who sells goods on a hire purchase basis, but there is, at the end of the day, such a thing as the individual's own responsibility. In the final analysis, this is also, in terms of our interest in becoming the world's most competitive region, about what forces we unleash in the economy and among small and medium-sized enterprises. That is why I am glad of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' ability to make a contribution in the form of opinions that may be slightly contrary, but that are no less important for that, and also glad that the Commission will in future be united in the line it follows in pursuit of this objective. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, all of us – or the overwhelming majority of us in this House – view the single internal market and competition in a very favourable light. There are, though, many people who are affected by this issue of general interest, and we are indeed seeing a burgeoning commercialisation of what are called services of general interest. To a large degree, such commercialisation is justified, but thought ought also to be given to whether or not we should go down this road. Much has already been said about the Green Paper and the Convention, and also about the question of whether we have left things too late. There is one thing that we can say with certainty, and that is that Parliament believes that the dialogue between the Commission and the European Court of Justice must come to an end. Parliament is being ignored to an extent that, in this area in particular, could scarcely be surpassed; hence the urgent call for the Commission to make some progress on laying down specific criteria for this. There are two points that are of great importance to me, and that I would like to see resolved once and for all. One feature of the discussion on services of general interest is that the Commission is willing to get involved only where economic activity is concerned. I am sure that this is perfectly understandable in principle, but it always ends up being about questions of detail. Is an ambulance service an economic activity? Yes or no? We do not need decisions in individual cases, but we do need the Commission to at long last specify the criteria to which it will refer when it takes decisions in future. It is not acceptable for decisions – like those on savings banks – to be at short notice and always, immediately beforehand, forwarded only for information. My second point relates to subsidiarity, which does, indeed, loom large in the Convention's deliberations. This is where the Commission's delay in making its presentation to the Convention has been crucial, but the regions and the Member States must continue to be given the option of determining these matters themselves on a local basis. What must not be allowed to happen is standards being imposed by the Commission through the back door. Subsidiarity is about having scope to take your own decisions on a local basis, so that things may perhaps be different in Bavaria – where I come from – from what they are in, say, Luxembourg, where the Commissioner comes from, or in Spain, Portugal, Greece or, in future perhaps, in Lithuania. That is why definitions must not be imposed through the back door. At the end of the day, though, I have to say that what we and the public need is legal certainty, and that is not promoted by what one of your fellow-Commissioners occasionally gets up to, then going as far as to advocate the deregulation of water. That, at the moment, is not on the agenda, and has to be dealt with in a sector-specific way; it is for that reason that the Commission needs to get around to taking action on this.

Mr President, Commissioner, there is support for an integrated financial market in Europe, and to this end we must draft appropriate rules speedily and in line with the interests of the market and implement them in Parliament. This was why the Committee of Wise Men created the Lamfalussy procedure. The goal is to achieve faster and better legislation. That was the original intention, and that was why Mr Lamfalussy launched this project, which was then supplemented by the von Wogau report. In general terms, we endorse it. However, we must measure the process as a whole in terms of whether the objectives are being achieved. Fast and better legislation is the goal, as has already been stated. It is not primarily due to Parliament that the legislation did not go through as speedily as had been hoped, and the Council must certainly examine its own role in this context as well. Before we deal with the issue of implementing the extended CESR-Lamfalussy procedure in other sectors, such as banking, insurance and conglomerates, we must ask one critical question first: how is CESR working today? Is CESR effective in the areas in which it operates? A great many questions and outright criticism can still be heard from various sectors of the market. I think that the first issue we should raise here is that of transparency, and of whether it is sensible for CESR to begin its work already, in parallel with draft directives. The question is whether we are willing to accept this in this form. I am in two minds here: on the one hand, I am fundamentally opposed to CESR working in parallel to a draft directive. We have this situation at the moment with the Prospectus Directive. Here, CESR should wait and see what Parliament and the Council decide before it embarks on its work. On the other hand, I am actually quite grateful for the fact that CESR does work in parallel, because this means that we find out in time what is going on in CESR's minds and can put the brakes on during the legislative process if necessary. In this context, the issue of technical details undoubtedly arises as well. I almost have the impression that technical detail is regarded as almost anything which, from the Commission's perspective, an average MEP is unlikely to understand – which would cover quite a lot. However, with regard to the technical details, we should not overlook the fact – and Basle II has already been mentioned – that there is of course political potential here too: there is conflict potential which will only become apparent over the course of time. For this reason, it is not enough merely to review Article 202; it must be amended. I would have liked to hear braver words from the Presidency today. These brave words must be heard in Copenhagen, at the latest. We need clear words that send out a clear signal that the Council and Parliament stand side by side on an equal basis. There are constant calls to Parliament to the effect that the interests of the market demand fast legislation. There is general agreement with this position, but I urge the Council to take Parliament's arguments seriously. There will be discussions and serious debates, and we do not want any buck-passing on this issue. This is why Copenhagen will be a good opportunity to send out a clear signal on Article 202. The same applies – and I endorse Commissioner Bolkestein's comments on this point – to the future role of the Commission. The Commission must retain its central role, for it is the Commission which implements and monitors the interests of Europe as a whole. Finally, let me say a few words about integrated financial supervision in Europe. We must ensure that regional aspects are taken into account. For this reason, I broadly endorse my colleague Mrs Villiers' comments that we do not need an integrated financial regulator at present. We must, of course, also give some thought as to how large European companies will operate in this area in future. Here, I see positive models in the Financial Conglomerates Directive, which sets out a course which we can follow.
Radwan (PPE-DE

 – (DE)
 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur very warmly for his work and for the prompt joint implementation of this directive. It is of great importance to the European financial market, to the internal market, and to financial services. In particular, we have to see to it that there is no recurrence in Europe of cases of the magnitude of Enron or World Com. It makes a fundamental contribution to the stability of Europe's financial markets. The success of a regulation of this sort is in the financial institutions' own best interests. The conglomerates are of course houses offering services in the fields of securities, insurance and banking. We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, tabled a number of amendments, relating in particular to the choice of methods of calculation available, but these were subtle distinctions. At the end of the day, we are very satisfied with the draft as a whole, which should be adopted in this form. I would, though, especially like to point out an innovation in this directive, one that is of great importance to us in terms of the overall discussion of financial supervision in Europe. I refer to the role and structure of the so-called coordinator, who is in future to be appointed for a financial conglomerate. An increasing number of such conglomerates are coming into being, for example, in my own country, Germany, by the buying-up of Allianz Versicherung by the Dresdner Bank, thus creating a classic conglomerate which is also active right across Europe. This coordinator is expected in future to be part of a country's own supervisory authority and to make sure that the work of Europe's various supervisory authorities is coordinated, and that accounting standards are the same. He is to ensure, on the one hand, that unnecessary bureaucracy is avoided, but also, on the other, that information concerning this conglomerate is exchanged, thus enabling a better grasp of the conglomerate's complexities. I believe that the good and important thing about this is that it gets us closer to answering the question of what shape financial supervision in Europe will take in future. Being myself at present unable to feel at all at home with the idea of a European super-authority to deal with financial supervision, I believe that we should extend this idea and concept beyond financial conglomerates to other fields and thereby gain useful experience before we give consideration to an overarching authority. I believe that the Conglomerates Directive can, in this respect, lead the way and give a good example. Therefore, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I can tell you that we will be voting in favour of this directive.

Mr President, Commissioner, today we are debating a subject that affects every consumer, every citizen in the European Union. It affects all our guests and, as far as the industry is concerned, it affects a great many jobs and a great many small and medium-sized businesses, not just in the countries in which the cars are produced, but throughout Europe. I too am affected and I shudder when I think of my last service bill, which was extortionate. That is why I am most grateful to the Commissioner for this courageous draft in favour of more competition. We have included a number of factors in this positive proposal, such as uncoupling sales and servicing and multiple brand sales, the location clause will be dropped and garages must be provided with information. So there will be much more competition here and I am most grateful to you for that, Commissioner Monti. I am also most grateful to you for arranging such an intensive dialogue with Parliament, for exchanging views with us and for stressing time and again that Parliament's support is very important to you. For that too I am most grateful to you. We have a situation here in which the industry stands on one side, the consumers, whose rights we are strengthening, stand on the other, with the dealers sandwiched in between. It may well be that the dealers will suffer most. I personally lobbied in committee in favour of strengthening dealers' rights – and I am most grateful to Mr Konrad for his support here – by including an investment protection clause, for example. One point under discussion is the transitional period for the location clause and the question of a review. I think there is no need to stress out about the review. If we opt today for a specific transitional period and if we are convinced today that it may not work, then we should say so in no uncertain terms, we should state our reasons and then those of us who said as much today will be able to say we were right all along. It may be a way of introducing competition here, but if we are talking about a transitional period, then we should not shy away from a review. The European Parliament will come to its decision tomorrow and I for one would be delighted if the Commission, starting with Commission President Prodi, were to respect the vote of the only elected representatives of the people of Europe, even though we are not officially involved in the decision-making process here. (Applause)

Mr President, this so-called compromise amendment was submitted to us late last night and then despatched this morning, initially – and inadvertently – with our name. That was then revised.

Just so that Mr Cohn-Bendit also understands: the two which were accepted were relatively straightforward.

In any event, we are opposed.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by sincerely thanking the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation. But I would also like to say a few additional words about the report. In Lisbon, a high-flown declaration was made that we would become the number one in the world. It is now evident that things will not happen as quickly as some people had hoped. We might now think that target was over-ambitious. Perhaps we should be honest and totally forget it. A lot of things are now attributed to 11 September and to the economic downturn in the USA. It is certain that the tragic events of 11 September had an additional negative impact, but negative economic trends had already set in before then in Europe. In particular, from a German point of view we should not lose sight of the fact that Germany is the largest economy in the European Union and that countries that have far closer economic ties with the USA, such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have far fewer problems than we do. We should move away from that. However, I fear that the Barcelona Summit has again proclaimed ambitious targets without us having done our homework first. When all is said and done, Europe should not raise expectations that the European Union does not have the power to meet. Instead, the individual Member States should take the announcements they make there seriously when they return home, and should do their homework, for example in the case of flexible working arrangements and corresponding tax reforms. I would also warn against repeatedly talking about coordination at European level. This kind of coordination could lead to additional illusory powers at European level. Ultimately, however, it is hard to move things forward in this area. What we need at European level is an offensive on behalf of small and medium-sized enterprises. It is SMEs that will create jobs in the future, and we assume that nine out of ten jobs will in future be created in companies with less than a thousand employees. It is important here to create framework conditions so that SMEs are not overburdened with bureaucracy and all the requirements that Brussels creates, and that in future the individual Member States should provide appropriate knock-on financing. However, at the end of the day it is also important for us to adopt a clear position here. This is also evident from the debate about the warning letter. I would like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Solbes for having insisted on the 3% being strictly adhered to. The discussions that have taken place in recent months about this have not only been damaging to the stability and growth market, but have also adversely affected Europe's reputation, its economy and the euro. We should turn our back on this sort of behaviour and have faith in our own economic strength. We should not be saying that America needs an economic upturn because it will benefit Europe – we should be able to achieve an upturn by virtue of our own strength and our own convictions. Just a few more words by way of conclusion. I have just heard someone talking about "coordinating state intervention". I absolutely must warn against that. The best form of social policy is a good economic policy. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur and in particular the Commission. In the von Wogau report on comitology we also introduced the area of market participants, and I believe that there was very good cooperation in the area in which I was shadow rapporteur for the financial conglomerates, between the Commission, the Council, market participants and Parliament, especially in the preparatory phase. This is in fact an appeal to the Commission to carry forward this good cooperation between market participants, Parliament and the Commission, and to eliminate sources of irritation and possible misinterpretations in advance. We have succeeded relatively well in doing this, and I think that we can work in this way for the future in accordance with market trends. People keep saying that this is a technical report because it is so complicated. It certainly does have major implications. I will of course comply with the President's wish that I should be very brief, but I would like to touch on one or two points, especially the collapse of Enron, which has been repeatedly mentioned. I believe that we need to take Enron's collapse seriously, and we need to think about drawing the necessary conclusions from it. One conclusion, for example, could be about how we deal with firms of auditors and consultants in Europe in future. Ultimately, however, in this area as well we need to take account of the changing situation – the fact that ever more financial conglomerates are coming into existence which operate internationally, in relation to the joint forum and at the same time Basel II. It is our job as the European Parliament to make sure that the public is protected, but also that our companies remain competitive in this global competitive struggle. We have to take appropriate corrective measures here. I believe that we have considered these measures here in Parliament as part of a calm dialogue, and that we have been able to eliminate many problems, and I believe that could set a good precedent for how we deal with these topics.

Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur at the outset for his close cooperation. All of one mind, we are on track to make Galileo a reality. I would also like to start by thanking the Commissioner, who repeatedly and doggedly pleads, and indeed fights, for Galileo at Council level. Economically, technologically and politically, Galileo is a strategic project for the future. That has already been said several times. Here in Europe, we should remember how it was explained to us decades ago that we did not need the Airbus, we did not need a missile industry. They would do all that for us, and it would be for the best. Where would we be today if, for example, we had not developed the Airbus ourselves? Now, though, I have two practical observations on Mr Glante's report. I consider it essential that industry should today already be actively involved in Galileo. There is no use in describing Galileo's importance in fine words; we need industry to make a clear commitment to Galileo. We must make a start right now on developing services to get products onto the markets of the future, products which would enable Galileo to be self-financing, which is what both sides of this House want: hence we need absolutely clear support for the Commission proposal to this end. We should, though, perhaps give thought to some reduction in the ‘front-loading’. I see Galileo's political dimension as a second important point. We want Europe to have a common foreign and security policy. We have the Rapid Reaction Force, and we want, in the future, to send our soldiers to troublespots. Here, too, we need to assume responsibility for our soldiers, which means that we have information systems of our own and are no longer dependent on third countries. What this means is that Galileo is, to some extent, necessary if we are to grow up in the way we approach external policy. Tomorrow should, therefore, see Parliament send a clear demand, for the sake of Europe's future, that the Council should decide in favour of Galileo! Apart from that, we propose, as an alternative, that, if the Council proves to be Galileo's undoing, we might well have to have thoughts about the defence budgets, and I am very definitely of the opinion that it is our primary duty to ensure that Galileo remains a civilian product.

Madam President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank you, Commissioner, for your exhaustive reply. I share your view that substantial progress has been made in the Basle II discussion process so far. Mr Karas, and Mrs Villiers as well, have referred to a number of fundamental problems, especially with regard to the various financing structures in Europe, and we still have a whole range of problems to resolve. You were right to address the problem of internal and external ratings, where we have made progress, but, as you yourself have said, the crediting of securities and the time long-term credits take to be assessed as being of a significantly higher risk are all yet to be discussed in Basle. What emerged from Mrs Villiers' and Mr Karas' question today was important for me to learn, and so I ask you to add to it. There are two points still outstanding. One of them is, as before, how the Commission exerts influence in Basle – if it sees these problems in the same way that we do; I got that from their answer. You have, admittedly, mentioned the Member States – including Spain, the new one – but, at the end of the day, it is we who are the legislators. What matters is that it be made clear there how we envisage transposition. I would like to have a more definite statement from you on that. The second thing that interests me is this. We all hope that, in Basle, all the problems that preoccupy us in the parliamentary process here will be solved. After all, we cannot all take part. What happens, though, if they are not solved? What view, then, for example, does the Commission take of something that has fundamental importance for Austria and Germany, namely, how we assess the value of long-term credits, if this problem is not resolved? That is the question that arises in my mind, and there is still the statement by your colleague Commissioner Bolkestein, who is present here, that a 1:1 transposition is imperative. A statement like that leaves us relatively little room for movement in Basle. What ideas are there circulating within the Commission about the introduction of a degree of flexibility here? At the same time, I would like to add that I would be very interested to know how you envisage the process of transposition. When Basle II is adopted – and you have yourself said that you are aiming for 2005 – it should all happen very fast. What we have heard from the Commission to date is that there will be a framework directive and then appendices to – as it is so elegantly phrased – deal with the technical details, and which will sort out the questions of a system of supervision as well. It will be a very rapid process. I would greatly welcome it if this working party linking Parliament and the Commission could start very soon, in order to get those within Parliament who are interested – and we three from the group of the European People's Party/European Democrats are very much so – involved in the process in good time and thereby avoid various problems with timescales.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to start by thanking Mr Alyssandrakis for the good work he has done with us. Ever since Lisbon, we in Europe have had the ambitious objective of being the best in the world, and technology and science are of course part of that, although I am not primarily thinking of the electronic voting apparatus we tested yesterday, but of advanced technologies such as, for example, telecommunications, earth observation and ecology. Europe must – as the past demonstrates – concentrate its strengths in these areas. Airbus and Ariane, based in Toulouse, are showpiece projects, demonstrating that Europe, if it concentrates its strengths, is capable of competing on a global scale. Industry is becoming ever more concentrated, and what counts here is the creation of European structures linking the European Union, the ESA and the Member States, which will facilitate more effective cooperation across the board. Thought should, though, also be given to international cooperation beyond Europe. Here, I am thinking not only of the USA, but also of Russia and China. Any European research policy should of course be of the sort that is also likely to attract the rising generation in this sphere. I am myself from the aerospace industry and have been given to understand that fewer and fewer young people have been studying these subjects in the last few years. We should be tackling that ourselves and not looking to immigration as we do in other areas. We also need clear objectives in this area, though; hence the urgent request to the Member States to vote clearly in favour of Galileo. Industry, too, should break new ground here. It is important to the future that not only State bodies should take on responsibility, but that industry should also contribute to the development of services that the citizens can use and that are also capable of being marketed. In conclusion, I would like to deal with an important point that has been mentioned, namely the so-called militarisation of space. I do not think that Europe should be developing a ‘Star Wars’ programme, but I find the idea of equating any military use of the infrastructure with SDI highly dubious. After all, we do not speak of the militarisation of telecommunications just because the German Army uses the telephone. We want a European foreign and security policy, we want a Rapid Reaction Force, we send soldiers to other countries, and these troops must receive the information they need. So we should indeed be thinking at a European level about becoming independent in this area and capable of using our own infrastructure in the future, so that we can do what our responsibility for our own soldiers and our political responsibility in this area require of us. I therefore ask for support for the amendment that Giles Chichester and I have brought in. We really cannot talk here in terms of an SDI; on the contrary, this is a sensible use of the infrastructure in Europe's interests.

, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. – (DE) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks, Mr Bushill-Matthews, for this excellent report. I would like to present briefly the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I do not want to devote myself to long explanations about why small and medium-sized enterprises are the economic backbone of European society. SMEs find access to finance ever more difficult, and a look at the agreements that Basle II will bring with it leads us to assume that this finance will become even more problematic. New methods of finance, such as venture capital, initial public offers, or all the other things currently being tried out or referred to, certainly represent a feasible way ahead, and one to which we in Europe will have to give thought, but not one to be used similarly by all SMEs. It is for that reason that I am glad that the Commission is taking up this issue on Europe's behalf. I would like, on the basis of my practical experience and of my discussions with many owners of SMEs, to tell the Commission of my principal concern, which is that future promotion of SMEs should also be tailored to their needs. Many owners of SMEs have no idea, or it is very hard for them to find out, where any kind of support at a European level is to be had. Support is meant to be transparent. Then I often hear complaints that support at a European level is very complicated, that compliance with the requirements imposed on SMEs is very difficult and that this often made the whole thing very expensive. Thirdly, all this should also be calculable in good time. Very lengthy application procedures stretched over many years result in small entrepreneurs quite simply running out of breath and not making it through to the final stages of the process. This means that everything possible needs to be done by the Commission to ensure that support for SMEs meets the needs of applicants from the target group, that is, the owners of the enterprises themselves. At a European level, though, we can ease the burden on SMEs or do justice to them not only by offering finance, but we should also consider how we might remove the burden from them by avoiding additional bureaucracy and regulation, which weigh down on them more and more. I believe it would be highly appropriate to put in place a screening procedure in the Enterprise Directorate-General which would make it possible to lodge a veto in good time, permitting the passage of regulations beneficial and appropriate to SMEs and excluding those detrimental to them.

Mr President, this report on services of general interest in Europe deals with a field of tension between two significant blocs. It is about the issue of a unitary competitive order in Europe, and about the self-government of communities or, in other words, about subsidiarity. The focus of all this must always be the citizen, the consumer, and what services he receives, under what conditions and, above all, of what quality. There are two points I find important in the communication from the Commission. It always speaks of an economic activity, with 'an economic activity' being very hard to define exactly. If we in this House discuss what an economic activity is, the thinking of a very large number of Members is shaped by their national origin. Is an economic activity to be affirmed when an enterprise works in a particular line of business for profit? Let me mention only ambulance services. The second is the issue of checking for misuse. The question here is not whether the Commission can check on this, but in what detail it should, so that over-restrictive requirements do not result in a definition of general interest by the back door. What is important is that we should be given communal responsibility and that we use it to choose one or other type of competition by means of public tender. I would like, finally, to re-emphasise one thing that is mentioned in the report, but not in the communication from the Commission, namely the market in water. For us in Germany and Austria, water is an extraordinarily important area. I believe that as a matter of urgency we should reject the opening of the market in water, brought about by means of a decision on an individual case in the European Union – and the Commission has already requested an assessment on the subject. We reject this decisively. Examination of the sector-specific situation is in any case needed first. I can therefore only warn the Commission not to take these steps.

Mr President, I would like to refer again to the vote, in which, alas, we lost the chance to vote on item 62. I have again consulted the documents: item 62 is an addition to item 58, and we should in fact have voted on it by roll call. Both my points of order were, unfortunately, ignored by your two assistants. What is at issue here is that we make it simply and convincingly clear that the opening-up of competition in the water market cannot be achieved by means of general competition law. I therefore want to reiterate this. I stated in my opening statements that we reject this, and I ask that this be noted in the Minutes and that, if possible, Members' requests to speak should not be ignored in future.

 Mr President, the object of the Stability and Growth Pact is to achieve lasting stability in the financial markets, which have remained a national responsibility since the beginning of the single currency. This means that the Stability Pact is a necessary counterpart in financial policy terms to the policy of monetary union and it is a financial policy substitute for political union, which did not come into being at the same time as monetary union. The objective of the pact is to ensure that there is sufficient leeway in budgets when times are good and to make provision for bad times. Some Member States, including Germany, have failed to do this recently. However, no sooner have the first difficulties appeared than people have started talking about how the criteria are interpreted. The usual criticism is that although the pact promotes stability, it also acts as a fiscal straitjacket and thus exacerbates weakness in monetary growth. This criticism fails to take account of the facts. The commitment made is to balance budgets in the medium term and to limit deficits, and it cannot therefore be thrown up in the air as soon as growth subsides. That is why a clear signal is needed from ECOFIN, especially after the discussions that have taken place. With just three months to go before the euro comes into circulation, as Mr Karas mentioned, we need a sign of stability. The problem is that we have failed to achieve the Lisbon objective of becoming the region with the strongest growth in the world. But we can only achieve that objective if the Member States do their homework. They cannot blame this on the European Central Bank. I would also like to take issue with Mr Tannock for suggesting that the ECB has not met its objectives during this period of crisis. The ECB in particular has reacted very well since 11 September, and the euro has held up. However, the fact that we were already discussing the Stability and Growth Pact before 11 September meant that we were playing with fire, as Mr Karas put it, and causing uncertainty. If we had not done that we would be able to debate the future of the euro in a far calmer way now.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Huhne, I, too, would like to add my congratulations to those of the previous speaker, Mr Harbour. This is an excellent report and it was a pleasure to work with you. I can already say that tomorrow we shall be fully supporting the line taken by this report. There are at present two developments running in parallel that are very important for this field. The Internet is growing in importance. Trade over the Internet is growing more and more. And on the other hand we are in the process of completing the internal market for financial services in Europe. Our target is the year 2005. Financial services in particular, because they are not material, are pre-eminently suitable to be offered internationally on the Internet. I believe we will in the foreseeable future have a situation where customers buy insurance or banking services over the Internet not from a local bank but across the border in a neighbouring country and that the Internet is an excellent way of making comparisons in this field. It is also important, however, that we win consumers over for this kind of commerce. It is consumer protection that I am addressing here; competition has already been discussed. But consumers will make e
-commerce in financial services a success only if they have confidence in it, if the contractual or non-contractual provisions are in place to safeguard their rights and to give them appropriate help if they have complaints in cross-border business. I support the Commission’s initiative here of setting up extra-judicial arbitration procedures such as FIN-NET. Only if consumers are convinced that any problems they have in future will be sorted out will they make use of the net in future. The third thing was mentioned by the previous speaker: technical systems. Many people are still afraid and have misgivings about using the Internet. I still have myself. I am not going to put my credit card number on the Internet just like that. There are still reservations and inhibitions about that sort of thing. Online and offline commerce are moving closer and closer together and we therefore need to harmonise the legal provisions here, too. I can only back what the previous speaker has said, that we must abide firmly by the country-of-origin principle, that the Commission must stand firm. Parliament will also be making its position known tomorrow. In smaller areas, too, however, like the abolition of national marketing and competition rules that stand in the way of the development of the Internet – fortunately, this was included in the report – we need to move forwards in order not to hinder development. I would like to say in conclusion that e
-commerce in this area will take a turn for the better, even if we may have gained a different impression from the stock markets in the last few months, but it will take off, it will continue to develop positively. We need to make Europe fit for global competition, ensuring that in Europe, too, financial services can be offered in this way. I therefore believe that this report shows the way and is a good step forwards, as is the Commission's support for it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we have now reached the last item on the agenda and I hope that the crush of Members will not now be too much. What is this report about? It is about the question of precontractual information on home loans. We are in the process of creating an EU internal market by 2005, and one of the objectives is that in future cross-border home loans should be offered and taken up by customers. An agreement in the matter has been reached at European level between consumer associations and banking associations. We need that to be put into effect relatively quickly. It would be gratifying if that were to happen in less than twelve months. I would like at this point to expressly highlight the positive role played by the Commission, which managed to bring the two sides together repeatedly and in the end achieve a result in this difficult moderation process. This may become the first positive example of self-regulation in the European Union. But there are still things that need to be done. First, we must look at the moderation process itself. It took about four years and according to some participants was not always very transparent. We call on the Commission to report to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs about the experience gained from this moderation process and the conclusions to be drawn for future self-regulation processes. As I have already said, it may be a positive example. But if it proves not to be a positive example of self-regulation, the Commission really will have to put forward its own proposal for a directive. A few points are still outstanding here. Firstly, of course, we need a commitment not only from the banking associations, but we need a Europe-wide commitment from the banks themselves. The extent to which the banks will participate is an open question here. Secondly, the register that is published must of course also be posted on the Internet. We also need similar forms throughout Europe. It is already foreseeable that some Member States that were very keen on producing a standard form, especially at the outset, will want to go their own way and may take a different route in future. At all events, comparability must be preserved here, in the interests of the customer. We ought to try to extend this agreement to the candidate countries. We should also extend the mediation body you have just mentioned, Commissioner, to this field. We should not retain the internal mediation body proposed in the agreements, but follow the Commission’s initiative here. We also need comparability of data. The effective annual interest rate in particular is highly important for the consumer. The figure at the end is not the only important thing, but the basis on which it is calculated, too. The effective annual interest rate is still calculated in different ways in Europe. We should work towards getting a uniform method of calculation. I would very much welcome it if this did not have to come from the Commission, but if the banks themselves could manage to agree on a method within a very short space of time. We should then also apply all this to services offered over the Internet. We have, after all, just had the Huhne report, which also said we wanted to press forward with this. We should have this information there in future, too. And finally, as the Huhne report recommends, future legislation should be harmonised with the legal terms used in this code. In conclusion I would like to stress that I very much welcome this voluntary code of conduct. It now requires critical appraisal and monitoring. We hope the Commission will before long present the Committee with a report on how successful the code has been and whether we can continue along that road or whether we must introduce legislation.

Mr President, the Christian Social Union supported the Katiforis report in the final vote. I should, however, just like to point out that we voted against item 4. We agree with the objective of the report per se
, which is to reduce budgetary deficits or even, if possible, to achieve a surplus. This is contradicted by item 4, which approves of new debts, even within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. In the final analysis, our message should be that this 3% should not be used up – which might well be the case – and that our objective is still to achieve a surplus. Parliament should do everything it can, especially on the eve of the introduction of the euro, to ensure that the euro remains stable and this should be the message that it sends out.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are living in an age of globalisation and digitalisation, and we talk about a knowledge-based society. The whole of our society, our economic life, is on the threshold of major structural changes. What we have become used to is disappearing; things are changing. A policy to establish a regulatory framework is now more pressing than ever. The European Union has set itself the ambitious target of becoming the most dynamic economic region in the world by 2010. To this end, a number of conditions need to be met and we need to do our homework. The policy on training has already been addressed on a number of occasions. The resource Europe has is knowledge. This is where we must invest in our young people, in particular. We talk about new technologies such as the Internet. But we also need to talk about equipping people with new ways of thinking. My generation and the generation before that did not concern itself very much with the idea of being independent or becoming an entrepreneur. I think in future we should make young people in school more aware of this idea so that it becomes quite natural for them to embark upon an independent life. But we also need to talk about flexibility in our labour markets. I fully concur with Mr Bullmann, when he talks of targets, but we are constantly experiencing just how little targets match up with concrete actions. We are all in agreement on the objective of making labour more flexible. But if we take a look at Germany and the new Industrial Constitution Act, then we realise that targets and actions do not always tally, which makes it all the more difficult simply to orient policies towards targets. We also need to make more effort in the area of high technology. The Internet has been mentioned. Access to the Internet in Europe is still too expensive. Its use in comparison with other countries is still too limited. Our approach to new technologies, such as biotechnology, needs to be more aggressive and more optimistic. But we should not restrict our investments to new technologies. We should also consider how to bridge the gap between the new economy and the old economy. I am fundamentally opposed to this demarcation. In Bavaria there is a carpenter who already achieves 70% of his sales via the Internet. If I may ask the experts here, does he belong to the old economy or to the new economy? I think he simply belongs to the economy. We need to bring them together and make them viable. But – and I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Gasòliba i Böhm on his report on deregulation – we need to become competitive. We need to make our structures competitive. We have had very positive experiences when it comes to air transport, telecommunications and energy, and other markets such as transport, gas, the postal services and finances are also being considered. Ultimately though, our goal must be to have competition only where it benefits the consumer. I would like to offer a word of warning that not every sector should be deregulated straight away just for the sake of positive competitiveness. An example is water. Water is a limited resource. We certainly cannot abandon the water market in Europe, with its high quality standard, to the vagaries of competition overnight in a sector specific or even case specific way. In this connection I support the issue of limiting competition – of limiting general European competition law to local and regional public services. Social structures and evolved structures are a form of capital for Europe: good training, good health, social tranquillity. We should not maintain structures just for the sake of maintaining them, we must develop them further; they can incorporate competitive elements. We can make them more effective and structure them positively. But we must not abandon political responsibility. It is a difficult balancing act. We will raise this issue again later in the year in the liberalisation debates in this House. But I think it must be possible to combine competition, subsidiarity and political answerability on the ground. I believe this is the route Europe must take to become more competitive and yet maintain cohesion.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to begin with very warm thanks to Mrs Theresa Villiers. In her report, she has splendidly succeeded in reconciling the entire spectrum of opinion in our Parliament. Let me briefly address the problem that in Basel we are creating a framework for systems that are not necessarily compatible, systems in the USA and systems in Europe, and here we must ensure that we do not ride roughshod over a particular area. Basel is looking primarily at the large banks. But we in Europe must look at the small banks. Their clients have few funds. We know that the large banks are no longer interested in them. Of course we must also make sure that Basel does not produce a second disadvantage for banks, as a result of higher own-funds requirements. As we keep repeating, it would be the small and medium-sized businesses that would bear the brunt, although we keep urging that they should be bolstered up. Internal and external ratings have just been discussed. I would also raise the question of portfolio straddling. We must ensure that the level of risk is assessed, and not just credit in the abstract, i.e. that we leave some room for manoeuvre in relation to small loans for small and medium-sized businesses and craft firms. I believe it is important that we also make it clear that what is going on in Basel is an undemocratic procedure, that the European Parliament is the only democratically legitimate organisation that is adopting a position on this in Europe. During the procedure we must not think about whether we are surrendering rights, but about the degree of detail to which we regulate matters in Europe in future, or where we should simply establish the framework and pass on certain instruments of adjustment to other institutions, such as the Commission, but also Basel. I also call on the European Central Bank and the Commission to take great care in Basel to ensure that Basel takes account of the structure of the European systems. Today we in the European Parliament must also send out the signal that we will not allow our established systems to be put at risk and that the large banks will also face problems if a legal framework is created in Europe. What we need is sufficient flexibility in this area.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I too should like to thank our colleague, Mrs Peijs, very much for her report and for being so persistent in her efforts to achieve results for the public. On 1 January 2002, the euro will also become a reality for the public, because then we will have the euro in our pockets. Today the average fee for transferring EUR 100 to another country in the internal market is EUR 17.10, many times more than the fees for domestic transfers. In the future, the euro area will also feel like a domestic area and the public do not understand why in this area, in which there are no exchange-related risks and in which electronic payments with Internet banking are increasingly becoming a matter of course, transferring money from Munich to Salzburg is considerably more expensive than transferring money from Munich to Kiel. The advantages of the euro need to be demonstrated to the public and also to small and medium-sized businesses, precisely because we are having problems at the moment with the acceptance of the euro and it seems to many as though large companies and banks are benefiting from it, but not the man in the street. For me, the argument that nowadays very few transfers of euros are made to other countries in the euro area does not count either. That is a chicken-and-egg debate. We in Brussels are of course experiencing this ourselves as Members, but our colleagues are too, that we do not make transfers abroad because of the high charges linked to the euro. I am firmly convinced that if prices fall the number of transfers will increase in leaps and bounds and people will avail themselves of this possibility. I welcome the fact that the Commission is maintaining its pressure on the banks and that it may increase the pressure further with the action it is taking against 120 banks. The European Central Bank should also exert increased pressure. The proposal by Mrs Peijs and myself also seeks to bring the banks together around one table, not to lay down the law, but because we simply cannot increase the pressure any further from the political side. Neither do we want any price regulation in this sector, but we should at least coordinate this. The ECB would seem the ideal candidate to make progress on single data formats and uniform bank sort codes in Europe. I also hope that the low prices will not come at one fell swoop in five years' time, but that they will come gradually and that it will already be possible to see some progress as early as 2002. At long last we will have achieved our aim if the banks compete on offering customers cheap transfers abroad. Then we will have a real market in this sector.
Radwan (PPE-DE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Montfort on her report and also thank her for the very good cooperation which we have enjoyed. It really has been fun. Where the economy is concerned, Europe's aim is of course to become the number one in the world and the multiannual programme can make a contribution to achieving this. However, what is particularly important in this sector is that we promote a spirit of enterprise in society and that young people give more serious consideration to starting their own business or to going into smaller companies. To do this we need to be active in the context of education in particular. Until recently, after completing their studies and training, many young people made a choice between going into the civil service or simply into larger companies which are similar to the state. Here we need to bring about a sea of change. But we also sense that this is already happening - many young people are in fact also founding new start-up companies, and we should encourage this entrepreneurial spirit. But I have three specific comments on this programme. Firstly, the Commission is saying that in the future it will promote and define policies which are enterprise-friendly. To this end it wishes to introduce a benchmarking exercise, which is certainly an interesting initiative. We must, however, ensure that it is effective. At present the plan is that this exercise will be run by the EU and the Member States, which will certainly not give an accurate picture. If I take my native country, Germany, then one single set of statistics for Germany does not reflect the situation in the regions. There are huge variations between, say, Bavaria and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Or take Greater London and Scotland. Greater differentiation ought to be possible here; the regions need to be involved if we are to get an accurate picture of the impact of enterprise-friendly policies. Secondly, the Commission is considering taking more of a back-seat role in supporting SMEs. This is certainly also a debatable step. The success of assistance to small and medium-sized businesses should actually be measured on how effective it is, and that is why the question certainly does arise as to what extent it is possible to provide this assistance in this form at European level. But if assistance is withdrawn at European level then the regions need once again to be given increased opportunities to act. In this context the de minimis
 rule should, in any case, be re-examined and the group exemption regulation for SMEs should be revised. My third point concerns traditional companies and e
-commerce. We always draw a distinction between the new economy and the old economy. Where I live in Bavaria there is one business, a carpenter, who now derives 70% of his turnover from the Internet. Is that the old or the new economy? I think that we should merge these two sectors to make the normal, traditional sector of the economy also part of the new economy. I have two requests of the Commissioner here: the first is for the Commission to support the development of software intended specifically for SMEs, which in terms of size and cost would be suitable for use by the SME sector. The second is for DG Enterprise, which was formed by merging the industry and SMEs portfolios, to champion SME-related issues with more vigour and to assume a watchdog function in the whole Commission for SME matters; it should scrutinise all the Commission's legislative acts and communications for their effect on SME-related issues. Finally, I also hope that the assistance programmes which the Commission offers to SMEs in the future are presented in such a way that they are considered from the customer's point of view, so that SMEs can always understand their purpose. (Applause)

rapporteur.
 – Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, ladies and gentlemen, the 1999 report before us from the ECB is both the first ECB report for a full year and also the first report since the introduction of the euro. As has already been mentioned, the stage we are now at is that the euro has already been introduced, but the public will only have the bank notes in their hands on 1 January 2002. Mr Karas will be dealing with that point in detail later on. However, it is important for us to win the confidence of the public by the time the euro notes are introduced. The increase in consumer prices over the last year of just over 1%, that is well within the ECB target of 2%, provides a good foundation for this. Mr Duisenberg, I would like to sincerely congratulate both the ECB and you personally on that. Because of your stability-oriented policy, the countries in the euro area can boast a historically low level of price inflation. If the policies of the ECB are to be successful, it must be politically independent. This does not mean that there is no accountability, but rather that a high level of information and transparency is required. I would like to sound a positive note by mentioning the European Central Bank’s regular reports to Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as well as the information published on the Internet, which you have already been referred to. But a young institution like the ECB has to win the confidence not only of the financial markets but also of the public. I therefore very much welcomed the fact that you addressed the public direct in May, and I think that should happen more regularly. The public is being flooded with information about the euro and I think that the information is not always eye-catching and informative. We need to counter that trend here today. The policy needs to be presented so it can be easily understood, and that would help to win people over to the euro. At the same time, a low inflation rate is a policy for the economically disadvantaged in our society. That is why it is important for the ECB to tailor its decisions to primary objectives. For example, as I see it, we cannot accept an inflation rate of over 3.3% simply because it makes it easier to achieve secondary objectives such as economic growth and employment policy. Those who are disadvantaged suffer particularly from creeping inflation, which I therefore regard as being socially unacceptable. The areas of economic growth and employment are primarily a matter for the Member States. This is exactly the reason for part of the weak external value of the euro. We need to make greater progress with reforms such as flexible labour markets, restructuring social security systems and liberalising financial markets if we are also to make the euro area more attractive as a financial centre and as a centre for investment. Mere declarations that we want to become number one in the world economy, like the one made at the Lisbon Summit, are not enough. The Member States have got to take action themselves here. That is why the objective of debt reduction and balanced budgets needs to be achieved as quickly as possible. But it is also important for the European Central Bank not to completely forget about the external value of the euro. On the one hand there is a risk of higher prices, of importing inflation, which is at present being aggravated by higher oil prices of course. On the other hand, and this brings me back to the subject of ‘information and the citizen’, many people see the external value of the euro as an indicator of how stable it is. With this in mind we must make sure that this factor alone, external value, does not weaken confidence in the euro. I accordingly welcome the most recent correction in interest rates, that is the increase by 50 base points, as a step towards a medium-term monetary policy with a view to creating confidence and calm both in the financial markets and amongst the public. Another sign in the eyes of the public that the euro is a good thing would be a marked reduction in charges for cross-border payment transactions, which you have already mentioned. In this case I believe it is important for the banks to set their sights far higher and make more rapid progress. For banks simply to refer to the standardisation of systems is not enough here. The introduction of the euro did not come overnight and it was not a surprise. I myself come from the world of information and communications technology. I know that if you put a subject right at the top of your agenda and really put some pressure on, you can get something done more quickly. I therefore call on you to get the European Central Bank to add to this pressure, so that our banks make greater efforts in this field. Lastly, I would like to talk about the imminent eastward enlargement of the European Union. First, I would like to make it clear that I am not talking about a treaty amendment, as was now and again suggested during the debate. What I have in mind is to examine the process ahead of us. No one is disputing that there is a three-stage process, from EU membership, to participation in the exchange-rate mechanism, and finally to full membership. However, a minimum level of economic convergence is needed to achieve this, and also to create a level playing field for the applicant countries and the present EU Member States. It is important not only to observe the criteria, but also to allow some leeway with regard to this compliance with the criteria. We cannot allow decisions that we have made in the past to keep tying our hands when it comes to the present and future process, over a period of five to ten years. We must maintain this process – this scope for interpretation. In conclusion, I would like to thank all my colleagues and the committee secretariat very sincerely for their support with this report.

Mr President, the debate has certainly shown the PPE-DE Group that we do not make things easy for ourselves, and that, at the end of the day, although the assessments are similar, different conclusions may be reached.   However, I would like to begin by congratulating the Greek government on the outstanding results it has achieved in the course of the last year as regards public debt and inflation. But it is the current situation that we need to consider. It is certainly true that by the very nature of its national economy, Greece is not destined to be the driving force, the big market within the euro zone.  Turning now to the question of inflation: Mr Goebbels, I hope – I do not know if I understood you correctly this morning – that the low inflation rate you referred to is here to stay. We will have a struggle on our hands. However, this is the first accession to the euro zone. Unlike the beginning, when Italy and Belgium also failed to make the reference values, we must now take care, in the light of enlargement eastwards, not to create new reference values, and allow this to become a never ending story. But that is precisely the problem it seems we are going to have to face. The important thing is to reach a decision today that will boost political confidence in the euro. In other words, we need to ensure that, in future, the markets believe that these are economic objectives and criteria and not political decisions.   The CSU (Christian Social Union) is proposing to vote against the motion today, which does not mean that it is saying ‘no’ to Greece and to the euro, rather it disagrees with the timing and hopes to be able to admit Greece next year. The ECB itself raised the issue of ‘sustainability’. It is precisely this view – i.e. deferral of the decision for a year, so as to allow the local economy to stabilise – that could send out a signal, both to the Member States of the euro zone and to the financial markets.
Radwan (PPE-DE

Mr President, first of all, I would like to say thank you very much to the Commission and to the rapporteur for the work they have done and for their excellent cooperation. Space exploration is, of course, a high technology field, which operates years ahead of its time in many areas and which is developing applications now that will only be available to the bulk of the population in ten or fifteen years’ time. Europe is in competition in this field with countries such as the USA, which is number one of course, but also with Asian countries and Russia. We must see that Europe strengthens its position in this strategic field and also takes a leading role. One positive example in this respect is of course the Airbus, with which we are all familiar, and which is responsible, on account of years of cooperation between the States and industries, for the fact that we now play a leading role in the construction of civilian aircraft and already have a market share of 50% in many segments.   Therefore, this is not just about space exploration itself but about how competitive Europe is going to be in the future. A number of examples have, in fact, been mentioned: earth observation, telecommunications, environmental protection, security. It is not just about practical applications but also, as you have already mentioned, about research.   I would like to highlight three points that I consider to be important. One is the future cooperation between the ESA, the European Union and also the Member States. We should, of course, give the Member States the latitude they need, in keeping with the terms of subsidiarity. However, there is also a case for improving coordination between the Member States, the ESA and the EU, precisely because the work undertaken in this sector is so capital-intensive. We also need to establish an opposite number for industry. Industry is undergoing a consolidation process. There are an ever-increasing number of public private partnerships in this sector. That is why there is an urgent need for industry to have a point of contact, someone with whom it can enter into dialogue, rather than running itself into the ground.   My second point relates to future commercialisation. We must ensure that the products, the applications from space exploration, are also used in practical applications for consumers in the future. We must create new opportunities in this respect, so as to enable small- and medium-sized companies, and start-up companies, in particular, to practise innovation. GALILEO is a key word here. Of course, we are having to compete with the American GPS system, but I believe that if we do more to help commercialisation on its way, then we will see more innovation across the board.   The third important point relates to the WEU, external security. The Kosovo conflict brought home to us only too clearly the implications of not having our own information system. Hence we should keep this option open if the WEU is incorporated into the EU. Having our own foreign and security policy means having our own information facilities too. We should not foreclose this option but always keep it in mind.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the pensions issue, which is what we are discussing today, is a very sensitive one. As a young Member of this Parliament I am of course thinking of young people, whose pensions are currently the least secure. We also need to safeguard freedom of movement in Europe and to ensure that those individuals, particularly young people, who are mobile within Europe do not suffer any disadvantage compared with those who remain in their own country all their lives. So as not to lose sight of the fact that we want secure pensions, what we also need to do is to liberalise the financial market in Europe and to create a framework so as to make the single market, as well as the German and the European financial market, competitive in the face of global competition.   The PPE Group has not taken the easy way out. We are still having intense discussions on this, focussing in particular on the second pillar, in the course of which we have learnt that the first pillar, state pensions, is no longer viable and we must strengthen the second pillar. Two arguments are in order here. If we are to strengthen the second pillar then it must be made equivalent to the first and built up accordingly, that is, it must take account of the biometric risks. Or one could argue that it is necessary to admit new products so as to enable this sector to develop in an effective manner and yield the necessary return, thereby securing pensions for the future.   My personal preference is to make people fully aware of the biometric risks and to put this issue right at the heart of the Commission’s agenda over the next six months. When it comes to the three biometric risks in question, I have a particular preference for longevity, which is an unshakeable fact in my view. But we should not establish a system today. The world keeps spinning, as do the financial markets, and we should also be open to new influences. We must accommodate subsidiarity within the competition of systems, but also within the competition of taxation law. I hope that the Commission will do justice to this task.
Radwan (PPE-DE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker’s statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service, is not a contradiction in terms. I think ours is a different approach! European policy has liberalised monopoly markets – energy, telecommunications and air transport – and the target, the focus, was always the consumer. The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services. I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs. He does not need a government to do so, or a parliament, nor does he need a Commission to do so! The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here. I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends. I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr Rübig, who also talked about e-commerce. That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges. I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market. It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy. We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe? These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe. I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy. And here I want to turn to an area where in my view – and this is a point also made in this debate – Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition. We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy, and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible. Yet I believe that, as this debate has shown, we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas. So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament. I have mentioned the example of social services before: nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer, including the pensioner in an old people’s home, and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition, whether that is the right course. I believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits, the positive aspects of competition. For competition is not an end in itself; it is there to serve of the citizen, the consumer, which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it.

 Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today, even though there has been a delay. I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation. Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service. All this is to the good of the consumer. But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further. The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement. Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate. At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world, of course. It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters. However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape. The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement. If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts. We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty. It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter. The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear, something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion. But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy. Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted, then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined. However, when it comes to what the future holds for competition, there are two issues dear to my heart. One is subsidiarity. We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions. Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union. I would cite, by way of example, the issue of job creation schemes, savings banks and regional banks, and Gütesiegel. Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products. This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention. I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation. We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other. My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now. I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector, but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters. These days, someone who lives in an old people’s home is accommodated within the social field. However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition. Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields. To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.

 Mr President, as has already been said, this House has a long tradition of concern with this issue. I remember how, before 1999, it was above all Mrs Maren Günther who devoted herself to this cause, in which we have achieved a number of successes and made significant progress. Today, we can see how most of the Member States – almost all of them, in fact; only a few have not yet done so – have already ratified the Protocol, so the assertions made only a few years ago that it was, for this or that reason, quite impossible to accede to it, have proven to be without substance. What this shows is that this is all about political will, so I can do no other than appeal to our Estonian, Latvian, Finnish and Polish friends to see to it that they sign up as soon as possible. I would say the same thing to our important ally, the United States of America. They and we may be partners in the war on terrorism, but in that anti-personnel mines have no part; they are themselves an instrument of terror. It is for that reason that we must do everything we can to prohibit production of them and trade in them, whilst also doing more to support the clearance of mines. It has been said, and rightly, that mines hit the poorest regions hardest. A few days ago, we heard from the Commission – and I am right behind them in this – that we intend to conduct accession negotiations with Croatia. Croatia is suffering in that, in the fields of one of its most fertile regions, that between Vukova and Ilok, with its wonderful vineyards, mines continue to be present on a large scale, thus preventing the people from returning home. It is even worse in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Kosovo, right in the middle of Europe. The same is true, of course, in those regions to which we are particularly committed, such as Africa, which we have been discussing today – and I agree with all those Members who have said that things are at their worst there – and also in Afghanistan. Although we are doing everything to help Afghanistan, our aid is concentrated on a few cities; this is due not only to errors of political judgement on our part, but also to the fact that there are so many mines scattered over wide stretches of the country that reconstruction there is making little if any headway. That, though, is not where the eyes of the world are focused. It is for that reason that I am glad that our resolution states that we have to pay more attention to mine clearance, to ridding the world of mines. It would be utterly absurd, though, if we were to deploy massive resources – as we must – in support of mine action programmes, while, at the same time, states such as our partners or even certain prospective Member States were to be producing new mines, which would then be laid. That would be nonsense from any rational person’s point of view. For this reason, there is no alternative to a ban, which must include all Member States of the European Union, and behind which we must throw our whole weight, both economically and in terms of foreign policy. Commissioner, I want to endorse your statement that it is not only Europe that must unequivocally ban these mines, but all the states on this earth, including the 44 that are still creating difficulties.

 Mr President, I have to say that what we have just heard from Mr Alyssandrakis is quite eerily reminiscent of a past that will at last be finally behind us when, in just a few days’ time, we welcome the States of Central and Eastern Europe into the European Union. For decades, this House has contended for freedom, human rights and the right of peoples to self-determination in Central and Eastern Europe. It has helped to sweep away Communism and its dictatorship, banish the ghost of Stalin, tear down the Iron Curtain and now unite the whole of Europe in freedom, and it is positively spooky that a relic of this inhuman ideology such as Mr Alyssandrakis should get up in this House and defend the dictatorship in Cuba. Let me say it loud and clear, my good friends: we are not, as you suppose, against the Cuban people. On the contrary, we defend them. Those who, before 1989, spoke in this House in defence of the Communist dictatorships must be ashamed when their words are dredged up from the Minutes. In the same way, you too will one day have to be ashamed of what you have said today about Cuba, one of the last brutal and repressive Communist dictatorships in the world. We do not have an uncritical attitude towards the United States, and God knows that I am not going to defend all the things that a blockade entails. I take a thoroughly critical view of it. I have to say, though, that it stands to reason that it is our duty as democrats to defend with all our might Cuba’s democracy movement, the rule of law there, and its freedom, against those who repress them, represented by the old-school Communist Fidel Castro, a man as lacking in understanding as you are, Mr Alyssandrakis, and, like you, forever yesterday’s man.

 Mr President, we must take a very firm stand against the human rights violations and acts of aggression in Nigeria; about that there can be no doubt. In contrast to Islam, which is a great world faith, Islamism is a criminal ideology, and a very clear distinction must be drawn between the two. We have to be careful, though, not to consider these things from one angle alone. As we know, most of the states in West Africa are artificial creations drawn on the map by the colonial powers, so that peoples in the South are divided, two examples being the Ibo and the Ewe, who are Christians and animists and live on both sides of the border. The same can be said of the peoples of the North, the Hausa and Fulbe, most of whom are Muslims and also live in a variety of states. This simply happens to be the way these states’ borders were drawn; never, throughout history, have they corresponded with the ethnic realities. This is something that has to be clear to us, and this is something for which we Europeans really do share responsibility. The resolution quite rightly refers to the state of Plateau. It is in Plateau that these ethnic groups collide, and the situation is made even more acute by economic inequalities and migratory flows. The whole place is a highly unstable melting pot and could easily explode. It also has to be borne in mind that Nigeria is a multi-ethnic state, one of the most populous countries in the world and probably the most populous in Africa, and that there are massive oil interests at stake there, so it really does call for extremely sensitive handling and subtle thinking. That notwithstanding, what I would like to say to Mrs André-Léonard 
is that it is taking sophistry a bit too far to say that there is fundamentalism in both the Christian and Islamic camps. There is no Christian fundamentalism in Nigeria. There is no Islamic fundamentalism there either; there is, instead, on the one hand, this complex conflict situation, and, on the other, Islamist ideologues attempting to exploit it for their own ends. If we are to address this situation, we need sound knowledge of these countries’ history and ethnic make-up; only then will we be able to support the peace process and prevent Nigeria from disintegrating in a bloody war compared with which the carnage in the former Yugoslavia will seem trivial. That, as has been said, is why our task is to get actively involved in the peace process, but to do so with precise knowledge of the realities of these countries, on which we can draw in our deliberations.

 Mr President, I am sorry to have to say that I had expected more from Mr Martin's statement. I thought he was going to explain why the Minutes state that he voted on many of the amendments to the van Hulten report, even though he was not in the Chamber at all. It is an inexplicable phenomenon how someone can claim to have voted on innumerable amendments, even though he was outside.

 Mr President, even though, in my opinion, considerable elements are missing from this resolution, it is largely balanced, and so I voted in favour of it. First of all, I believe that no solution to the Kosovo problem can be found without first making clear decisions as to the future of Kosovo. If we do not define the status that we want to give it, then the standards cannot be achieved. To this end, I believe that the route taken to date is wrong. Secondly, I think that the United Nations Transitional Administration has discredited itself so much that it should be replaced there by a European civilian administration, which could be better controlled and which would – if it avoids the mistakes that UNMIK (United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ) made – enjoy more respect. The third and final point that I wanted to raise is that it is being said that Kosovo-Albanian leaders were insufficiently unequivocal in condemning the riots, but they did do so, and emphatically. President Rugova declared a day of national mourning for both nationalities, whilst the Serbian Prime Minister 
marched at the head of a demonstration in Belgrade where there were calls to ‘kill the Albanians!’

 Mr President, I welcome the Baltas report as a cautious step towards Croatian membership of the EU, and I must say that we had got even further on this matter, since, with the Brok report, this House clearly argued for candidate status and for Croatia’s accession in the next wave. I would like to say that we should continue down this route. Although, through no fault of its own, Croatia is in a different league from the Member States that will be joining us on 1 May, it is, in many respects, as ready for accession as some of them are, and I believe that we should give immense support to Croatia so that it is present in the next wave of enlargement.

 Mr President, I voted against the Oostlander report even though it includes many good ideas. I would, however, like to clearly associate myself with the line taken by my colleague Mr Bourlanges. We want a strong Turkey as a good partner, but we also want a stable European Union that is capable of action. Those who turn Turkey into a full Member State of the European Union, destabilise the European Union. Those, however, who only lead Turkey to believe that they really have a chance of being a candidate, are ultimately destabilising Turkey because they are, so to speak, luring the Turks in with unattainable promises and then letting them down by imposing ever tighter criteria. This is a game I am not prepared to play. I am in favour of an honest policy on Turkey, which says that there are limits to everything, even to a Europe that can be integrated. Turkey must be our closest partner and as far as Byzantium is concerned, you can say that Saint Augustine came from today’s Algeria, and he was one of the fathers of the West, but even so, I would not incorporate the current Algeria or the future Algeria – even a democratic Algeria – into the European Union. The European Union is not the amalgamation of all democratic countries in the world that fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, but rather all European States that fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and wish to join.

 Mr President, I will be very brief, but this is important. Firstly, I wish to protest against the dropping of today’s debates on matters of topical and urgent importance, Tuesday’s question times and the debate on the cultural capital of Europe, even though enough time was available for them. Secondly, I wish to make a personal statement on behalf of what has been called the Friday Club. I am grateful to the Members who are present for doing their duty right into the evening. They used to do it right through to Friday lunchtime, until that was no longer possible. It is monstrous that there should be someone in this House who is attempting to make criminals of these Members, of all people, who are performing their duties in an exemplary manner. I will be working here this evening on behalf of those whom I represent, and will be doing so until tomorrow lunchtime. That I affirm; I believe it to be our duty. I rejoice to see all those here who are doing their duty rather than going about defaming and discrediting this House. (Loud applause)

 Mr President, Ukraine is without doubt a European country – one of the largest – and we must not forget how this European country was for decades oppressed and plundered as a Soviet colony. There is no room for self-righteousness in the criticisms we level at Ukraine today, for we, thank God, have been spared a fate such as theirs – or, at least, most of us have been. There is much, then, that we have to appreciate and understand. For Ukraine to develop will take some time. We in this House have, over recent years, done a great deal to support Ukraine, and even before the great changes between 1989 and 1991 there were elements in Western Europe who cooperated with it. I am thinking here of the Ukrainian university in exile in my electoral district in Munich, or of Radio Liberty, which used to broadcast from Munich, which was perhaps something of a free Ukrainian metropolis. That has always given us a great deal of sympathy and understanding for the Ukrainian people in their aspiration towards a life of their own. We cannot, however, show any consideration towards politicians who are not merely corrupt, who are not merely dragging their heels when it comes to getting their country to make progress, but are even doing the very opposite by trying to freeze to death the tender shoots of democracy and the rule of law, who are actively using criminal methods to counter their opposition, and attempting to silence their critics in the media. To take one example, it is an appalling scandal when a Member of this European Parliament – Mrs Stauner, and she is surely not the only one – is shadowed by an officer of the Ukrainian secret police, because she brought members of the Ukrainian opposition into this House or raised critical issues, such as the trade in organs, the trafficking in children and many other problems that there are, unfortunately, not only in Ukraine but also with Ukraine. Our policy, then, must be an utterly unambiguous one. While we must, in principle, be sympathetic towards the Ukrainian people as an important European partner, we must speak out strongly against, and take firm action against, all those who, in whatever way, seek to whittle away and destroy the democracy that is coming into being in their country.

 Mr President, obliged though I am for that exhaustive answer, my question had to do with the EU’s present borders with the candidate countries, with their future eastern borders with the states of the CIS, and more specifically with the programmes that are meant to keep in check the prostitution that is prevalent there. What is currently going on in the area where the Czech Republic borders on Bavaria is this: most of the victims and many of the culprits are from further to the east, that is, from Russia and Romania, states that are not yet due to join us. The scene of the crime is generally in the Czech Republic, which is an accession country, and the customers, those who spend the money, are, lamentably enough, mainly from the present EU – from Germany, in fact, so this is a cross-border problem. What I am specifically interested in is what is being done in the border regions to sort out the great deal of prostitution that is going on there.

Mr President, in the killing fields of Cambodia the Khmer Rouge murdered millions of their own people, and now the country is struggling to find stability and equilibrium. It is balanced between the King and the political parties, there is a degree of balance between the parties – sometimes more, sometimes less – and the country is also trying to maintain a balance between various outside influences. A constant balancing act is, however, no recipe for long-term stability, which cannot be achieved unless the rule of law is firmly established. This is why paragraphs 4 and 6 of the resolution are of paramount importance. Straightforward prosecution, by due process, of the murderers and assassins who are threatening the very existence of democracy, and above all the long-overdue creation, together with the United Nations, of a special criminal court with a view to enabling Cambodian and international lawyers to work together in order to ensure that those who have committed crimes against humanity can finally be brought to justice and duly punished: in this way, after a bloody and turbulent past, the country can at long last find stability, underpinned by the rule of law, which will enable it to become an important partner of our European Union.

 Mr President, I would like to thank the Council President for his very full and detailed reply. I simply wish to add two critical comments or questions. Firstly, we are constantly hearing the phrase 'standards before status'. I am told, however, by all the major investors in Kosovo that they will not be investing in Kosovo in the long term unless they have some idea of how status is likely to develop. In other words, the 'standards before status' concept only functions to a limited extent because there is simply no certainty about Kosovo’s future. That is a problem for economic progress. The second point I would like to raise in this context is that the Americans have announced that discussions on Kosovo's final status could open in 2005. Should the EU not be preparing for these negotiations this year, in 2004, at the latest so that it is not presented with a fait accompli
?

 Commissioner, firstly I do believe that it is the Commission’s role – and one you fully appreciate – to ensure that the relevant legislation is actually enforced. In essence, that justice and administration in the candidate countries really do work within a reasonable time. This is why you were right to address the 3% question. Secondly, I believe – during the previous question time, you did state that you are still responsible for minority issues, including in candidate countries – that the Romanian and Hungarian legislation seeks to treat all citizens equally. You know that there have been considerable problems with the Czech legislation, for which there is of course an official explanation. Announcements were made by Mr Mareš and others regarding initiatives intended to improve the situation. Do you know whether anything is being done? Are there perhaps plans to apply these models, or at least to make another move towards reconciliation? There was a lot of talk nine months ago but since then no more has been heard.

 Mr President, we are shocked by the murder of Archbishop Courtney, whom, in the five years that he was here in Strasbourg, we knew as a diplomat, pastor and also as a personal friend. I simply have to say that he was one of the truly great ecclesiastical figures in the tradition of the great Irish churchmen of the Middle Ages, who was always actively committed to the cause of peace and humanity; it was he who made it possible for us, here in Strasbourg, to join together in a service once a month, something he started along with a few of us in this House. I can still remember how Archbishop Courtney took his leave of us when he went to Burundi to actively involve himself in the peace process there. As soon as his aircraft landed there, it was shot at; there were rockets to welcome him. He then, in peril of his own life, spent five years participating in the peace process, drawing on the wide experience he had gained from his missions in trouble spots on four continents. He was meant to go to Cuba this week to take up office as papal Nuncio there and help human rights and freedom of religion to prevail. His mysterious, brutal and deliberate murder put a stop to that. We should honour his memory. He would certainly not, though, want his murder to be the only reason for us to focus on Burundi and thereby forget that murder is a daily occurrence in that country. In recent years, over 200 000 people have been murdered there, not because of what we term ethnic conflicts, but because of a deliberate policy of genocide, and the fact that the situation in nearby Rwanda is even worse, and that in its neighbours Uganda and the Congo no better, should not hide from us the fact that we have a special obligation to this region, tormented as it is by ethnic killings that know no borders. Europe does have obligations here, and our respect for Archbishop Courtney and for his legacy demands that we take appropriate action.

 Mr President, an ancient Christian kingdom that had long repelled all invaders became a Russian colony. Then after the First World War, Georgia enjoyed a brief period of independence during what we might term the ‘Caucasian Spring’, a fact that is generally forgotten. It was brought to an end by Lenin, who failed to uphold his own principles of nationality. Then a strong liberation movement emerged at the end of the Soviet era. We should not forget that the liberation movement in the Soviet Union began very vigorously and very early in Georgia. We ourselves have a great deal to thank Georgia for when it came to the fall of the Iron Curtain. Then President Gamsakhurdia was murdered. This was followed by civil unrest, the separatist movements and the Shevardnadze era, which has now come to an end – thankfully without bloodshed. The country is now at a stage where it finally has a chance to establish a system genuinely rooted in freedom. We must ensure that after many decades of foreign tutelage, the country has the opportunity at last to become what it once was in history, namely a genuinely independent and peaceful factor in a very important and very dangerous region. That is why we must push to ensure that Russia upholds the binding commitments it made to the OSCE in 1999. We often demand, very arrogantly, of small states that they honour commitments that have often been imposed upon them, so we must be rigorous in demanding that when a major power enters into such commitments voluntarily, it is scrupulous in upholding them. Mrs Schleicher is quite right, in my view, to say that Russia cannot be our partner if it fails to fulfil its commitments on this key issue. We see that there are other powers as well which, for geostrategic and energy reasons, are aspiring to establish a particular dominance in the region. That is why it is our obligation, as Europeans, to stabilise Georgia as our partner, although I would not go as far as Mr Dupuis, who is demanding full membership. Georgia is a country with a great European tradition. It is our valued partner and it can be a beacon of freedom in an extremely dangerous region.

 Mr President, I agree with Mr Meijer on many points. However, I am afraid it is rather simplistic to describe the death penalty as a relic of the Middle Ages. I am afraid that the death penalty is quite specifically a feature of the modern age as well. The guillotine and the electric chair are symbols of the modern age. So that this phenomenon vanishes from the modern age, we must lobby actively for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide, regardless of the individual or the state concerned. We have great sympathy and understanding for the Philippines, a country which is more at threat from organised crime, separatism and terrorism than most other countries in the world. On the other hand, however, we must make it quite clear that terrorism and violence can only be overcome through justice and the rule of law, and that the thousands of detainees and persons condemned to death in the Philippines have just as much of a right to life as anyone else. We oppose the death penalty in every case – whether the person concerned is Saddam Hussein or the perpetrator of other serious crimes. The same naturally applies to the detainees in the Philippines. We must make one thing very clear. No state has the right – other than in self-defence – to challenge any individual’s right to life. For that reason, the EU opposes the death penalty as a matter of principle and has made this a criterion for accession. However, we must also make it a benchmark against which we measure our partners. We therefore send out a very clear appeal to the Philippines: a) to uphold the moratorium, b) to review the thousand or so trials, many of which are of dubious legality with miscarriages of justice and political caprice, and c) to abolish the death penalty in general, for it can play no part in enforcing the rule of law.

 Something happened yesterday which does not belong in the Minutes, where it would merely be out of place, but rather in the full session report. I must take advantage of you being here again. Yesterday I addressed a question to the Italian President-in-Office of the Council and received an answer. I then asked a follow-on question. In the full session report, you will remember, I asked whether he was saying yes or no, and his answer was no. This ‘no’ does not appear in the full session report, although I recorded it on tape myself. What is more, the full session report repeats the second part of his written reply, distorting the overall sense of the question time.

 Mr President, a few minutes ago, over in the Robert Schuman Room, we presented Otto von Habsburg and Raymond Barre with the Franco-German Paneuropa Prize, and we recalled how, for ten years under Otto von Habsburg’s leadership, this House took debates on topical and urgent matters like this one as an opportunity to fight for Greater Europe, for freedom in Central and Eastern Europe, and for human rights behind the Iron Curtain. Even then, there were many who told us that the work we were doing had no prospect of success whatever, that it was pointless, and that what we were doing would get us nowhere. Today, there are among us observers from various countries – Mr Landsbergis was also at the ceremony earlier – who can tell us that debates like the one we are having today changed the practical conditions under which they were held as political prisoners, and that, most of all, they gave them hope in political terms. Today, too, we are on the threshold of the enlargement of the European Union. Let that give us courage when we debate Vietnam. It is a topic that we have often discussed, and, alas, the people named in the resolution – some of them important religious leaders, are still in jail; human rights activists are still being suppressed, and peoples are still enslaved. We should, however, recognise that the time is coming when the wind of freedom will blow through Vietnam. We in this European Parliament must not relent in campaigning for human rights and for the freedom of religion, even if there are those who tell us that this is unrealistic and bid us talk business instead. We are under the great obligation of living up to our tradition and our name as Europe’s Parliament. We appeal to the Commission and the Council not to fail at this hour. Vietnam is an important partner, both in political and in economic terms. As a country, it has suffered appallingly through wars, intervention by outsiders such as Europeans, Americans and the Soviet Russians. Like Germany, it was a divided country; it endured a Communist regime and suffers its effects to this day, but it will be able to become a stable partner to the European Union only when it has become, no longer merely an economic factor, but a free state under the rule of law, a democracy in which freedom of faith and conscience prevail, and we ask you, tomorrow in Brussels, to employ your energies without reserve so that it may become that!

 Mr President, my voters do not want their tax money to be used to kill unborn human beings, even if, unlike in Germany, it is permitted for research purposes in many Member States. For this reason I came out quite clearly against this report as it now stands and have from the outset supported the clear line taken by Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and by Mr Gargani. We were, however, prepared to go a long way in a compromise motion in order to prevent something worse. I would like to thank Mr Nisticò and Mr Liese for giving this House the opportunity for a compromise that is so far-reaching but which sets limits. Unfortunately, this was turned down by a tiny liberal left majority of this House and I must make it perfectly clear that that is probably the end of compromises in this matter. This House is divided on this important issue and I imagine there is the same division in the Council of Ministers. I do not believe that we should use our in any case meagre research funding to finance such highly controversial research on so divisive an issue; we ought to concentrate on things that are not controversial in the EU and leave this question, to which the principle of subsidiarity should apply, to the Member States.

 Mr President, it is more than three years since President Putin came to office and it is time to take stock. What has happened since then? The FSB secret service, the successor to the KGB and which Mr Putin once ran, is now three times larger than when President Putin came to office. Politics has been increasingly neutralised. The same is true of the media. There are hardly any really independent large media left. Now it seems to be the turn of business, to judge by the goings on surrounding the so-called oligarchies. Those are serious danger signals in Russia itself. Looking at Chechnya, we find that in 1999 Mr Putin unleashed the second Chechen war of the post-Soviet era, part of the most bloody election campaign in recent history, or in history at all. This war has seen hundreds of thousands driven from their homes in Chechnya and tens of thousands murdered. Many speak of almost one fifth of the Chechen population. That would be as many as under Josef Stalin. These are not trivialities, they are very serious events and Europe needs to be concerned with them, especially when an important partner is involved. We all know that Russia cannot develop a Swiss democracy over night. But Russia has set strict criteria for itself. It has joined the Council of Europe. It has entered into a special partnership with the European Union. That means it has itself agreed to be judged by democratic standards and the rule of law and it must try to live up to those standards, but I fear it has increasingly failed to do so over the last few years. Of course things are better today than in the days of totalitarianism, but we are currently witnessing a trend not to more but to less democracy and rule of law, as Yelena Bonner, the widow of our prize-winner Andrei Sacharov, has made clear. So far as Chechnya is concerned, President-in-Office, I have only one thing to say: you are confining the Chechnya problem too much to the subject of terrorism. The Italian word for what is essentially going on in Chechnya is not terrorismo
 but resistenza

 Mr President, I have been in this House for some time now and even before I was elected in 1994 I worked here. I remember, for example, the last Italian Presidency and the one before that, amongst others. On those occasions, the Council spent the night here and Question Time was held in the night sitting. I just wish to remind us of this. Out of consideration for the Council we subsequently moved Question Time to the afternoon, with the result that it has not worked since. I really would like to make a plea for Question Time to be moved back to the night sitting, enabling the Council to spend the night here in Strasbourg in the future – there may still be the odd hotel room available. It is a beautiful city and I think that for the six months concerned it would not be too inconvenient for representatives of the Council Presidency to spend a night here from time to time.

 Mr President, I have a quite specific supplementary question for the Commissioner. There are recurrent debates in this House about what precisely is meant by the expression ‘reproductive health’, and that also features in our choice of organisations. I just wanted to ask you, Commissioner, whether the expression ‘reproductive health’ includes abortion or excludes it.

 Mr President, under item 8, this document states that the Western Balkans do not form part of Europe, which is quite nonsensical. I would ask the rapporteur to clarify this, as I will not, otherwise, be able to vote in favour of the report. (Laughter)

 Mr President, although the Jarzembowski report is certainly a significant milestone on the way to a European rail market, I would like to say that we have, overall, a vast amount of catching-up to do in European railway policy, and wish to highlight above all the utter neglect of the lines connecting the east with the west and the west with the south-east. It is my belief that the unification of our continent, which is currently underway, makes the rail link running from Paris via Strasbourg and southern Germany to Vienna and Budapest, as well as the route from Stuttgart to Prague, of pre-eminent importance. Our discussions of railway policy give me the feeling that it is far from clear to many of those responsible that far more is at stake than whether or not this or that area is opened up to traffic; this is really about a great transport project called ‘European Unity’. What we have achieved to date is fragmentary at best, and I wish to appeal, above all to the Council, the governments and the Member States to make substantial funds available for railway policy. I believe that this is not only of paramount economic importance, but also that the unification of Europe as a whole cannot succeed unless we at last do massive extension work on the routes between east and west. Although these connect the most important regions of Central Europe with one another, it is unfortunate that they do not link up to most of the national capitals. It is for this reason that many states that focus on their own capital – Germany, for example – regard them as far too peripheral.

 Mr President, I regret having to address something that is an internal group matter, but, on Tuesday, our group agreed with the rapporteur that this item 8 would be amended, as it is drafted in a misleading way. The fact that this was not done obliged a number of Members, including Mrs Pack and myself, to vote against this report on the grounds that its infelicitous drafting gave the impression that the Western Balkans, Belarus, the Ukraine and Moldavia were among the neighbouring regions of Europe rather than of the European Union. There is no doubt, though, that these states form part of Europe, and, self-evidently, the Western Balkans also have the prospect of accession – indeed, ever since Thessaloniki, the right of accession, too – as soon as these states fulfil the European Union’s criteria. I therefore object to the way in which this form of words puts the Western Balkans on the same level as West Africa and the Southern Caucasus. That is quite nonsensical. I do assume, however, that the expression ‘Western Balkans’ does not mean Croatia, as this House, on the basis of an amendment that I jointly got introduced into another report by Mr Brok, decided as long ago as 9 April this year that it regards Croatia as a candidate for accession in 2007.

 Mr President, although our group supports this resolution – a very balanced one despite the many amendments, which we all accept – we do believe that what is needed, above all, to resolve this problem properly, is a realistic long-term process. For a long time, in this region, the land of the great lakes, we have seen very violent conflicts, even going as far as genocide and mass expulsions, which, if we merely apply short-term remedies, will only keep on recurring. That is why it matters that we should start by clarifying terminology, for the words that we use here are often not the same ones that are used in the region itself. We talk in terms of armies, parties, or refugees, but these are, as a rule, ethnic groups appearing in the guise of an army, a party or as refugees. What matters in the first place is that some sort of stable balance be established between the ethnic groups, with it being ensured that all of them participate in political life and are represented in the armed forces, in the administration and, as the amendment so rightly puts it, in the justice system above all. This is where it is very important that we should proceed with tact and sensitivity, rather than adopt a schoolmasterly and accusatory role, for ethnic misunderstandings and prejudices led us Europeans, too, to spend centuries smashing each others’ skulls in, and such things are still going on in Europe today. We really do, then, have to approach this task with the proper sensitivity and humility; we cannot expect people who were doing terrible things to each other only a few years or months ago to be able, within only a few months, to behave as if nothing had happened. That is why we need this process; although we must waste no time in getting on with it, we need sensitivity, we need time, and we need to be present. That is why we need civil servants, lawyers and also officers from the armed services to act as advisors to both sides.

 Mr President, I was glad to hear Mrs Stihler speak, and also that a number of Socialist Members have rejoined us, as we covered two important human rights issues without the second strongest group in this House saying anything about them. I was already worried that the group had ceased to exist or had abandoned human rights policy. I would just like to ask, in the event of their no longer needing their speaking time, whether the Rules of Procedure would allow it to be transferred to us in future. We would be very grateful for that.

 Mr President, I was shocked by what Mr Frattini had to say about Chechnya. In making these statements, you are putting yourself at odds with what the majority in this House has thought and said for years, and also opposing the position that the majority in my party, the European People’s Party, has taken for years in this House. We have stood up for freedom and human rights in Chechnya, where Russia is engaged in a brutal colonial war, the second stage of which was inaugurated by President Putin in the course of the bloodiest election campaign in history. Mr Putin is, unfortunately, not going to solve the problem, for he is a quite substantial part of it. On attempting to consider the problem from the point of view of Russia’s interests, one discovers relatively quickly that Russia’s interests and Chechnya’s are in fact one and the same. Russia is suffering from financial problems; in Chechnya, billions are being senselessly squandered on a futile and bloody war. In Russia, democracy and the rule of law are suffering decline and – as Andrei Sakharov’s widow Yelena Bonner, has very powerfully described – the war in Chechnya is being taken as an opportunity for old structures to re-establish themselves. Russia is suffering to a quite substantial degree from remilitarisation and the return of elements from the secret services, developments that also essentially derive from Chechnya and the war that is being waged there. Russia is suffering from terrorism and from organised crime. As Mr Oostlander so rightly said, the war in Chechnya is doing nothing to remove these problems, but is making matters worse. It can therefore be said that those who commit themselves to freedom in Chechnya and to its liberation are ultimately also committing themselves to freedom and liberation for Russia. In the long term, Russia will have to recognise that the only solution for its problems is for Chechnya to be a real democracy, and we have to see that the problem is that the pseudo-referendum that has been held there is intended to legitimise someone who was and is a villain rather than a legitimate partner in dialogue, namely President Mashadov.

 Thank you, Mr Frattini, for your answer, which was extremely good and specific, and for the very good work that the Italian Presidency of the Council has done in this area. I have just two specific supplementary questions. Firstly, will the group of border experts to which you have referred produce a written report at some point in the course of the year or at the end of the year, or will it take even longer? That is my first question. My second brief question has to do with the Police College. Do you think, as regards the issue of where the various bodies are to be based, many aspects of which are still open, that this package can be got to grips with before the end of the Italian Presidency, or will it – and the issue of the Police College not be able to be sorted out before the end of this year?

 Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with two forms of torture, which it is equally important to combat. The first works on the pretext that it is necessary to find out certain information, for example in the case of dangerous terrorism. The other form of torture quite clearly seeks to destroy and break people. Obviously we reject both forms of torture in equal measure. Unfortunately it is the case that many people think that torture is something out of the Middle Ages and a problem that in our advanced age we had overcome at the latest by the Enlightenment. It was, however, precisely the twentieth century that in a very particular way produced cruel forms of torture and the cruel torturous regimes of Communism and National Socialism, and we have to recognise that, even at the beginning of the twenty-first century, torture regrettably continues to be a reality in many parts of the world. In Latin America, torture has thankfully declined considerably since the 1970s and 1980s. In Africa, there is hardly any country where torture is not practised. In Asia, it is often precisely important European Union trading partners – who otherwise appear in pinstripes as business associates – who have perfected various forms of torture and unfortunately the issue is still relevant here in Europe. Just a few years ago there were particularly cruel cases of torture in Kosovo. Or look to the East, for example: thankfully the situation in Central Europe has improved – next to me is sitting my friend Figel from Slovakia, a human rights campaigner – and happily 12 years ago these nations overthrew the cruel regimes that practised torture in a democratic revolution, but in the Member States of the Council of Europe, which is meeting concurrently at the other side of the Ill, the problem still exists. In Chechnya, for example, the Russian military is responsible for committing brutal acts of torture, and no one is talking about it. Tomorrow in the Council of Europe, they will discuss whether to introduce monitoring for Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein is an exemplary democracy, while in Russia, in Chechnya, torture continues to be used. Compared with Liechtenstein, however, it is a large country, and that is why no one dares to tackle the issue. Or take Turkey, a candidate country: it is finding it very difficult to cope with the issue of torture, and yet it also belongs to the Council of Europe and has an association agreement with the European Union. This is not just about far-away third countries or past periods of history; it is about the reality of our foreign policy. That is why I welcome the fact, Commissioner, that the Commission is making this issue such a high priority. I welcome the fact that it is determined both to raise this issue at international level and to actively help the victims of torture, wherever they may come from – we still have a large number of traumatised torture victims with us in Europe precisely from the Balkans – and above all to work in the field of prevention. I should like to lend my strong support to this initiative. Our foreign trade policy and our human rights policy need to be joined up; the same applies to our development policy. The time of human rights clauses in our treaties being just window-dressing is over; they must also be applied and if they really are violated then of course measures must also be taken, because just complaining, just lamenting, just criticising does not do any good. Quite simply, practical, substantial steps also need to be taken and I do actually believe that a country in which torture continues to be used on a daily basis for the purpose of administering justice simply cannot be an appropriate economic partner for a democratic Europe. That is why I am in favour of a dynamic policy in this field.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that Mrs Lulling is not only the European Parliament's queen of wine but also its queen bee. I should like to thank her very warmly for this commitment, because we should be aware that this has been a matter of concern to the European Parliament for decades. Back in the 1980s, the Bavarian Member of Parliament and pan-European, Heinrich Aigner, who sadly is no longer with us, brought together hundreds of Bavarian beekeepers to inject some impetus into this issue. We have been working on it for 30 years, and unfortunately we have not made a great deal of progress. I have to say quite clearly, Commissioner, that I am grateful to you for your precise answers and for taking this important issue so seriously, because an ecological crisis is slowly developing in this sector. In Bavaria and Austria huge numbers of bee colonies died in the spring frosts, but also of course because of insecticides and diseases, and we are feeling the ecological effects very keenly, for example with our fruit. That is why I really believe that now is the time to promote something that is under serious threat, namely passing on beekeeping to the next generation. A very high proportion of beekeepers are old, because fewer and fewer people from the younger generation are prepared to take on this arduous, but ecologically necessary, task, not least because the financial rewards are ever more meagre. That is why I should like to say quite clearly that I – like Mrs Lulling – call for all measures to be taken to support the marketing of natural European honey ahead of cheap, undeclared artificial honey, with which we have repeatedly had to contend, or honey from abroad. I would also call for something that is always the subject of some ridicule, but which is ecologically important, namely the pollination premium for colonies of bees, so that we promote this activity by giving beekeepers more support. I should particularly like to thank you, Commissioner, for your examples from France, which plays a leading role in this sector. Your country also has a former agriculture minister for president and it is a country, which, thank God, takes healthy eating and delicious food very seriously. I actually believe that we in Europe should finally see this issue, which is regarded by some perhaps as a bit of a joke, for what it is, namely a health issue and a prerequisite for a functioning environment and ecological system.

 Mr President, the reason why I abstained is that I regret that our amendment relating to our Judaeo-Christian heritage was not adopted. Not even a Marxist history teacher can deny that Europe’s roots are both Christian and Jewish; without them Marx and Marxism would not have existed, and if Europe turns away from God, Christianity and Judaism, it is cutting itself off from its roots, only to be swamped by materialism and to collapse. The second point I want to make in this connection is that it is an illusion to believe that this Treaty can be put under glass and can never again be amended. Twenty-five governments are not going to meet together just to do nothing; they will work on the Treaty, and we hope that they will improve it. It is to be hoped that they will include in the preamble reference to our Judaeo-Christian roots and also make a number of improvements in the institutional sphere, such as having one Commissioner per Member State, which I too regard as essential. While we do not want the package to be completely unwrapped, there are some definite improvements that the governments should carry out in October.

Mr President, the thirty-nine data elements that we have been dealing with today can be divided into three categories. Firstly, superfluous data, the storing of which has already – in the GDR and elsewhere – caused intelligence services and whole states to collapse. In the interests of the fight against terrorism this data should not be saved. Secondly, useful data which would, on entry, be removed anyway. This data can be used in an appropriate and legal manner. Thirdly, however, there is sensitive data, on which we need precise rules, and which must either not be recorded, saved and passed on at all, or it must at least be deleted after a deadline, after the person leaves the USA. Although we are all vehement advocates of the fight against terrorism, terrorism cannot be fought with anarchy, but rather in two ways. Firstly on the basis of the law, and this – rather than arbitrariness – we should step up. I regret to say that at the moment in transatlantic relations there is arbitrariness regarding these questions of data, and an absence of any legal basis. Secondly we can fight international terrorism only on the basis of trust between the USA and Europe, trust that was damaged through both sides apportioning blame and must be re-established. Trust can only arise when genuinely transparent rules are created, ones that the public can understand, otherwise we will fuel mistrust of both the USA and the European Union itself. Commissioner, I do not think that we can wait until international rules are in place, nor can we rely on the current fifteen and future twenty-five Member States implementing the law. It is much more a fluke that the Commission, with you as a spokesman for the European Union, which will soon have more inhabitants than the USA and Russia together and must be a partner of the USA, is acting on this important issue, but intentionally and on the basis of the law. Therefore, Mr President, I would like to call out to the Commission: be tough in your conduct of the negotiations, Mr Bolkestein! Be firm, or be tough on these important questions of trust and the law!

 Mr President, I am glad that this report has been adopted. The report by Michl Ebner from the South Tyrol is successor to a long line of great reports adopted by this House on this subject since the 1980s, beginning with the Arfé Report, produced by a great Social Democrat from the Valle d’Aosta. I rejoice in it. It was the eastward enlargement that made it necessary to send out a clear signal concerning these matters, for a very large number of minorities and ethnic groups will be finding their way to us: Hungarians in Slovakia, Germans and Poles in the Czech Republic, Poles in Lithuania, Lithuanians in Poland, and so on. Taken together, members of the minorities will, numerically speaking, be the second largest Member State in the enlarged EU, after Germany but before France. That shows the immensity of this issue in quantitative terms, and even in qualitative terms it is of great significance, as these minorities can become either the mortar in the foundations of the EU or an explosive charge. We want them to be the mortar that holds us together.

 Today, Mr President, we have voted on two reports on human rights. Even though it is in fact the issue of human rights that leads me to sit in this House, I voted against both of them. The reason for this is the fact that the issue has, unfortunately, been misused for ideological reasons. My criticism is primarily aimed at the way in which, with the van den Bos report, we have taken an unambiguous stand for religious freedom throughout the world, whilst at the same time treating the statement by Cardinal Ratzinger and the Catholic Church on same-sex partnerships as some sort of violation of human rights. This just shows the ideological misuse of the issue of human rights. European society is founded not only upon the inviolable dignity of the person, but also upon the inviolable dignity of marriage and the family, the defence of which is one of our tasks as politicians. Future reports on human rights should protect marriage and the family, rather than calling them into question.

 Mr President, West Africa provides examples of the extent to which this region is rent asunder. On the one hand, it is where there are the best opportunities for a regional market to grow and develop, and some states have done well by African standards in making progress in recent years. On the other hand, there are states – of which Sierra Leone is one example, and Liberia is another – where not only is the state in crisis, but where every vestige of the rule of law threatens to disappear. We have to consider how we are going to respond in the face of this situation. We have to be clear in our own minds that Liberia started out with a congenital defect, as the descendants of black African returnees from America were in violent conflict with the indigenous inhabitants from the word go and the state has never been internally united. Today there are also violent conflicts, organised criminality, powerful raw materials interests, and the danger, despite all current efforts and even though some period of time without war can be achieved, that the real problem, the establishment of a constitutional state that functions to some degree, will not actually be tackled. Important though troops are, they cannot do it on their own. What the country needs is the establishment of a state, the building of institutions, and the truth that a state does not come into being automatically is demonstrated in Somalia, where there has been no rule of law whatever for the past ten years. It is a characteristically European conception that well-ordered states must always and everywhere be in place, even though, in the aftermath of the Thirty Years’ War, it took us decades to re-establish a functioning state order. For a start, then, we should not take an arrogant approach to these matters; secondly, we need to apply a certain healthy realism. We must first put a stop to the violence and must alleviate the direst need; then, though, will begin a process, which will last decades, of re-establishing political institutions that work to at least some degree. That will not happen without massive help from us, but nor can it be successful unless the people want to help themselves. It cannot happen without support from the country’s neighbours, without regional cooperation, without the establishment of a regional community in West Africa. There are however two sides to this, as the state borders and ethnic boundaries do not coincide, resulting in the danger of aid to neighbourhoods being misused – as it was in the Congo – in order to strengthen the hand of related peoples in internal politics on the other side of the border and to upset the balance of nationalities. A healthy combination of external help, help aimed at enabling people to help themselves, and regional cooperation offers the only chance for this region, racked by crises, to get back on its feet, at least in the medium term.

 Mr President, important though they are, minorities and European journalists are not the sole foci of our attention today; our concern is with the people of Laos themselves. Laos is an ancient kingdom and very rich in culture; it was, as a country, peaceful and tolerant, which, in the days when it was a kingdom, was a threat to nobody. I am glad that the Laotian royal family are present with us today. In the course of the twentieth century, the country became a victim – firstly of colonialism, then of the Second World War and, last but not least, of the conflict between East and West. It was brutally wrecked by Communist occupation. It must be clear to us that, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, our task is to ensure that Laos becomes a flourishing democratic country rather than ending up as a museum of real-life socialism. We therefore declare that human rights and the rule of law need to be reinforced, that freedom of faith and conscience need to be respected, and that political prisoners must be set free. As a matter of priority, Laos must become freely accessible to the media, so that the world can learn what is actually going on there, and so that the country’s continuing deficiencies are not hidden from it. We in the European Union seek cooperation with Laos. We will abide by the trade and cooperation agreement if the human rights to which it refers are respected, but if this human rights clause is disregarded and treated as nothing but a joke, then we will have to put a question mark against our cooperation – with the regime rather than with the Laotian people – and make it perfectly clear that, while trade, business and cooperation are necessary, they are founded upon law, underpinned by human rights and by the values on which our global community depends. It is for that reason that we make it our concern that Laos should once more be free, democratic and under the rule of law. (Applause)

 Mr President, we are devastated by the reports we hear about Uganda and the appalling acts of cruelty committed there. When one sees all that is perpetrated by the loathsome armed sect which calls itself the 'Lord's Army', one is inclined to think that the Ugandan army had enough work to do when it comes to guaranteeing peace and security in its own country, without sowing discord and strife in neighbouring countries, where it intervenes to promote the interests of the great powers, economic and tribal interests, and so on and so forth. It is, however, lamentable that, even if the Ugandan army were to concentrate on Uganda, that would not resolve the problem, as the Ugandan army and government are part of the problem rather than a means of dealing with it. That is why we need a clear-cut policy here. We must first see to it that the Sudanese attacks on Uganda, along with other interventions by outsiders, are stopped; then, secondly, we also have to get the Ugandans to put a stop to their own incursions into neighbouring countries; thirdly, Uganda needs to make a start on using the police and armed forces, under the rule of law, to do away with the criminal elements, a process that must go hand in hand with a process of reconciliation and negotiation, leading progressively to the setting up in Uganda of something like genuine democracy and the rule of law. This country has had much to endure under various dictators, through several wars, and at the hands of diverse criminal elements. It is vitally necessary to restore the precarious balance between the tribes and ethnic groups of this country, whose diversity is known to us from the days of the Kingdom of Buganda under the Kabaka, which also includes many, many other ancient kingdoms and tribes and will have a democratic future only on the basis of the rule of law and if the balance of races and ethnic groups is carefully maintained.

 It was suggested earlier that the war in Chechnya is linked with the war on terror. I wish to make it very clear that I believe that what Russia is doing in Chechnya is not a war on terror, but that it is actually giving rise to terrorism. We need to be quite clear that Yelena Bonner, Andrei Sakharov's widow, is right when she says that what is happening in Chechnya is genocide. I shall not mince my words – I believe that this is a colonial war driven by the energy interests of Gazprom and others. That is what it is really about. So it is vital that we should not deceive ourselves. Many well-regarded international human rights organisations came to the conclusion that the so-called referendum was a total sham. Convenient partners for bogus peace talks have been created. The OSCE has already observed elections in Chechnya. There has already been peace in Chechnya once. Mr Mashadov was democratically elected in the presence of OSCE observers, so why are we not negotiating with him? Why has he been forced to go underground? This has happened precisely because he represents his people and is not a puppet. This will not lead to peace, Mr President-in-Office, so the basic presumptions underlying this debate are utterly false. Choosing puppets as your partners in talks has never been effective and has never led to peace. I would therefore like to make one point very clear: what I regard as being dishonest about this debate and about many of the speeches we have heard – including speeches made by Mr Putin, who used Chechnya as the bloodiest election platform in history in order to come to power – is the word ‘normalisation’. When was the last time we heard about ‘normalisation’? It was in 1968, when the national uprising by the Czech and Slovak peoples was put down. That is not the sort of normalisation we want!

 Mr President, I am very grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for that very good and clear reply. I would like to put just two supplementary questions. Firstly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights refers merely to ‘reproductive’ rather than to ‘therapeutic’ cloning, although the two are one and the same thing. Germany, France and other countries are trying to get the United Nations to ban all types of cloning throughout the world. I just wanted to ask if the Presidency of the Council might also take some action along these lines. Secondly, you are right, with regard to this issue, to invoke the subsidiarity principle, but is there not the danger that, in such areas as that of embryo research, the European Union might modify or undermine many Member States’ more stringent provisions on the protection of embryos?

 Mr President, I am obliged to the Commissioner for his reply. As we know, we tend to see Africa as very largely characterised by single industries; on the other hand, though, Africans see Europe as very much made up of conglomerates. What I want to ask you is what the Commission is doing in order – and I do know that this is in practice very difficult – to build up cooperation between sub-Saharan Africa and the European Union as regards small and medium-sized enterprises. There is virtually nothing moving on that front. I would like to know what is being done in the area of cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises. Although most small businesses still do not dare to venture into the region, I do believe that they would make very important partners for Africa, if it is not to be dominated by single industries and conglomerates to the exclusion of all else.

Mr President, I would like to come back to Mrs Malliori’s request. I spoke on this subject about a week ago, to be exact on the last day of the part-session. The problem is that the agenda is adopted on Monday, but not adhered to by Thursday. I believe it is inaccurate for Mrs Malliori to say that her report is being postponed until this afternoon. Today’s agenda states that the time allocated to all reports – from Mrs Jöns’s through to Mrs Fourtou’s – is 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., which gives us until 4.30 p.m. to discuss this report. If it becomes the accepted thing to request that reports are dealt with without debate in order to be finished by 12 noon on Thursday, then people should say on Monday that a debate is not required when we are adopting the agenda. Last time, I said that this was a dangerous precedent, and indeed it is one. We have had two hours for the topical and urgent debate on the reform of the Rules of Procedure taken away from us for nothing, on the grounds that this time was needed for other work, and leaving us with just one hour. This time should then either be used or given back for the topical and urgent debate. (Applause)

Mr President, I have just two points, which are however important because they are questions of principle. Firstly, in future we should decide on Monday whether a matter is important enough to require debate or not. On Monday, we scheduled this matter for Thursday afternoon, so why are we cancelling it now? If it is important, it makes no difference whether it is discussed in the morning or in the afternoon. Secondly – and this is a crucial point which I last brought up during another debate on a Thursday afternoon – you have, or your predecessor has, just taken a vote which is not permissible. According to our Rules of Procedure, only the President of Parliament can decide whether to cancel a debate. It is his decision alone, and there are extremely important reasons for this. We voted to establish the agenda on Monday and I have to clarify whether or not this decision to change it is the President’s. (Applause)
 According to the Rules of Procedure, this decision is his alone, but in this case he has not taken on that responsibility. (Applause)

Mr President, I apologise for coming back to the same problem. I certainly do not wish to be difficult. However, the right to freedom of expression is highly protected.

On Monday, we decide to debate a matter on Thursday afternoon and Members assume that this debate is going to take place. But on Thursday afternoon, a Member says that they do not wish to have the debate because they have to leave. That is what happened last time, and it happened this week too. The agenda stipulates that, if this happens, just one speaker should be called upon to speak for each group. But this procedure is not being followed either, and instead, we are referred to a rule which says that the agenda can also be changed on a proposal from the President. But firstly this was not a proposal from the President, secondly it must remain an exception, thirdly the President gave no reason, and fourthly I have to say that there was no important reason. When I asked you about it, your answer was simply that we needed ‘to keep some flexibility in our agenda’. This is about the right of freedom of expression, a right guaranteed to minorities. I would very much like the Bureau to clarify under what conditions the President can propose that a point be taken off an agenda that has been jointly decided by us on Monday, and whether or not he has to give his reasons for doing so. Otherwise this minority right will be regularly set aside on Thursday afternoons if there happens to be a majority vote in favour of it. Then we might as well forget all the articles protecting this minority right in the Rules of Procedure, particularly Article 111. (Applause)

 Mr President, I am entitled to make both a personal statement and a statement concerning the Rules of Procedure. Mr van Hulten has invited me to respect democratic decisions. It was a democratic decision of this House that this report should be dealt with this afternoon. Therefore it is not I who have gone against a democratic decision. Secondly, you have taken Rule 145 as your basis, and I should like to draw your attention to Rule 145(2), which states quite clearly, ‘If the proposal or request is carried, only one member may speak from each political group which has not yet provided a speaker in that debate’. That means that, if Rule 145 had really been applied, an opportunity to speak would have had to be given to one Member from each group! I am therefore really asking that these things should be clarified.

 Mr President, today we are looking at one of the most difficult foci of crisis in Asia, one that threatens to become ever more dangerous, and we cannot grasp this subject if we merely fall back on the usual clichés. Indonesia is a world of many peoples, and, in geographical terms alone, it far exceeds any of our European dimensions. In that part of the world one cannot measure everything by the same yardstick. We have the problem that Aceh is an ancient historic Sultanate, which has had a significant cultural influence on the region. Aceh was a great seafaring nation. Aceh has also had a religious influence on the area. It was from there that Islam spread so extensively throughout Asia, and the island has developed a very strong and healthy sense of identity. In the colonial period, Aceh, like many other nations in this region, was simply brought into line with all the others and then, after decolonialisation, it became a part of the new artificial State of Indonesia. Now we certainly do not want to call into question the integrity of this State of Indonesia, which, on economic and strategic grounds alone, is one of our most important and valuable partners. On the other hand, we have to look at the reality of the situation, and the reality is that in Indonesia they have made the mistake of trying to solve the problem of the over-populated islands of Bali, Java and Sumatra by coming up with what is known as the Transmigration Policy, in other words they have tried to resettle people from these islands on other islands with a different cultural and historical make-up, and to outvote other population groups, which has led to a whole range of ethnic and religious conflicts. These conflicts are not, as in the Moluccas, simply conflicts between Muslims and Christians, but in Aceh they are also between Muslims and Muslims, or between different ethnic groups. For that reason we must approach this subject with great caution. On the one hand we must demand, very clearly, an end to the use of force in Aceh and an end to the terrorist activities taking place in the region. On the other hand, however, we must also demand that the Government of Indonesia, which is our partner, meets its obligations, and that means fully implementing the autonomy arrangements for Aceh and ensuring that democracy and the rule of law prevail there, and that, above all, humanitarian organisations, international observers and the international media have access to the region. Indonesia should have nothing to hide; it is our partner. However, the way in which Indonesia deals with the self-aware Aceh province and its freedom is also an important criterion. (Applause)

 Mr President, thank you for your very sound answer. Even before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Bavaria maintained a close partnership with Ukraine and my colleague Mr Radwan and I have just given a massive boost to trade with Ukraine. Trade and business need a framework, however. For this reason, I would like to raise two quite specific questions: first, to what extent is the TACIS Programme being intensified, with a focus on institution building
 and training up a new, younger generation of executives to work in the government, the judiciary and the administration? This, after all, is where the shortage is greatest, and the reason why the economy is unable to function. The framework for the rule of law is not functioning. My second specific question, Mr President, concerns the geostrategic situation that you mentioned. Here, of course, the countries in the southern Caucasus play an important role, although they will not be direct neighbours of the EU. I wanted to ask you what the role of the southern Caucasus is in terms of cooperation with the Black Sea states?

 Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to express my thanks for your very detailed, very good and concrete response and put to you an additional question. I am not sure whether you will be able to give me an answer to it straightaway or perhaps only in writing, after this question time. Member States are supporting minorities in the accession countries. For example, with the agreement of the countries concerned, Germany is giving support to the German minority in Poland and the German minority in the Czech Republic. There is now a rumour in these countries that at least part of this support by another Member State would be unlawful after accession to the European Union. I cannot really understand that and therefore wanted to specifically ask about it because this question is currently making people extremely worried. Can it be that the promotion of minority languages by other Member States is unlawful in the EU?

Mr President, I did not want to say anything about the Minutes, but before you come to the Minutes, I would like to come back briefly to the procedure adopted this morning in respect of the vote. During the lunch break, I checked again to see which of the Rules of Procedure could be the basis for holding the vote on the Schmitt report –
 which was firmly on the agenda for this afternoon –
 at midday without a debate. I failed to find in the Rules of Procedure any rule which, in my view, would cover this procedure. I therefore wish to request the Bureau to notify me formally which article in the Rules of Procedure formed the basis for this morning's decision.

 Mr President, I apologise for coming back to the issue I raised before. Thank you very much for precisely citing the article to which reference was made. However, like Mr Wieland, I take the view that this refers to other articles, all of which I have read and which have nothing to do with the procedure adopted this morning. Then there is the option of a proposal by the President. I would like to know whether what happened this morning was a proposal by the President and was based on a decision by the Bureau, or whether the President decided to move such a proposal spontaneously. We must recognise one thing: the Rules of Procedure deliberately make amendments to the agreed agenda difficult, for after all, they should not occur all the time. On the other hand, obstacles are deliberately erected and, as we must acknowledge, there are minority rights as well. If, for example, the Conference of Presidents decides that no debate should take place on an issue, it is possible to counter this with 32 votes. In other words, very carefully balanced rights exist which also make it possible to proceed against a short-lived majority. These obstacles are deliberate. The only possible exception is ‘a proposal by the President’. Here, the question which also arises is whether that is correct. I therefore request you to clarify, firstly, whether this was a proposal by the President, and, secondly, whether it was based on a decision by the Bureau. Thirdly, I doubt whether this is an adequate legal basis for this procedure.

 Mr President, I would not normally rise to speak on this issue, which is handled very competently by my colleague Mr Ferber, who is one of the most vigorous champions of postal service liberalisation, but who also works tirelessly to ensure that the customer's interests and rights and consumer protection are taken seriously in the European Union. I have risen today because I believe that we really must press hard – as my fellow Members have pointed out – to ensure absolute transparency. I would like to thank the Commissioner for the plans that she has announced. However, it must be said that such transparency has often been, and continues to be, sorely missed in both the Commission and especially the Council, although, of course, we also demand absolute transparency from the postal services as well. Moreover, and I fully endorse what my fellow Members have said on this issue, we of course need Parliament to be in a strong position in terms of its legal status. We need codecision. We must be quite clear about this, because no one else, apart from this House, represents the interests of postal service users adequately. I would like to make one thing quite clear: the reports which have appeared in the media in the last few days – my fellow Member has already mentioned them – which claim that value added tax is to be imposed on postage stamps really are designed to generate anti-European feeling among European Union citizens. I really do urge you to bury these plans as swiftly as possible. I do not mean that you should play them down, I mean that you should bury them. I do not think that it is the European Union's task to put forward this type of proposal, which is completely half-baked and really only has an impact on consumers. Secondly, let me say this: we must ensure – and this too has already been mentioned – that the postal services, notwithstanding all the liberalisation which we are trying to achieve, of course also continue to have a key social function. As we know, our society is increasingly fragmenting into those who can make dynamic use of modern technology and those who cannot. We must not forget the people in peripheral regions, the socially weak, and the increasing numbers of old people. The age pyramid is turning on its head. In many Member States, the postal systems seem to combine all the disadvantages of the old state monopolies with the shortcomings of the new liberalised market, instead of creating synergies by drawing on the positive aspects of both new systems. This clearly demonstrates the problems associated with the current transition period, especially for customers, as well as the serious lack of transparency. Let me give you just one example: Deutsche Post
 removed large numbers of post boxes throughout Germany by stealth. In my electoral district, there is a hotel called 'Zur Post
', which has provided postal services for centuries. Overnight, its post box was dismantled, causing damage to the building's façade. The licensee, whose family has operated a posthouse in conjunction with the hotel for centuries, was deliberately not informed. Just imagine the scenario: so many post boxes have been removed that the ones in Munich are now overflowing. It has actually become impossible to post a letter in the city centre at certain times of the day: the number of post boxes has been cut back to such an extent that they are completely full by the afternoon. That is not competition. That is not customer-friendly conduct. It shows that there is also still a tendency to think in terms of the old monopoly structures while ruthlessly ignoring what was perhaps their social dimension, namely the provision of a service to citizens and a service to customers. I therefore believe that we need as much market as possible, as quickly as possible. We need as much transparency as possible as quickly as possible. However, we also need minimum standards of consumer protection in areas where the market alone cannot regulate the problems that arise, which means the areas I have described, in particular. I therefore believe that it is essential to press ahead with this process, not only through communications and Green Papers and so forth, but by working in close cooperation with the European Parliament on a legal basis which enables us, the only legitimate representatives of the European citizens and hence the postal service users, properly to monitor this complex process, which profoundly affects the life of every individual, and ensure that it is economically profitable, socially just, and compatible with people's needs.

 Mr President, the wars going on in the Congo are tribal wars – ethnic wars – which, in terms of their duration and the devastation they cause, are basically comparable to Europe's religious wars of the seventeenth century, such as the Thirty Years War. The Congo has been called a continent in a continent and the disaster there is indeed taking place on a continental scale. The Ituri region should be one of the most beautiful in the world. If peace were to prevail, it could be a centre of tourism and prosperity. That is why – and I would like to make this very clear – our task is not to point the finger arrogantly at others but to provide help by attempting to deploy our troops in the country as part of a robust peacekeeping mission. We really cannot leave this task to the French, no matter how grateful we should be to them. At present, we spend a great deal of time arguing over the role of the UN. We are moving towards an odd situation in which major powers want to create legitimacy and the UN, with all its shortcomings, is expected to provide the instruments. It has to be the other way round. The UN must provide legitimacy and the world's major stabilising factors must attempt to supply the instruments. For example, a politically and militarily united Europe, in partnership with the United States, can be a peacebuilding factor there, but a group of troops slung together arbitrarily without a mandate cannot. This is not an isolated or indeed a minor problem. In Africa, survival is the problem, and the Congo is its most acute manifestation. These conflicts are also inflamed, not least, by vested interests in the country's resources. We cannot leave the task to the Congo's neighbours, for in many cases, there are ethnic groups in these countries who also have an interest in fanning the flames of conflict in the Congo. As we have seen, the borders are artificial, with ethnically homogeneous peoples living on both sides of them. If there is to be peace, there has to be a new order, and we must make a robust and substantial contribution to achieving this at last.

 Mr President, I believe that especially in view of the spread of entirely new diseases and epidemics in East Asia – SARS is sadly only the tip of the iceberg – it is a matter of urgency that Taiwan, a highly industrialised state which is visited by many people and has great experience in politics and administration, should be integrated into the World Health Organisation, something that this House has demanded on various occasions. I think it is very regrettable that this matter – which, in the age of globalisation and world travel, is important not only for Taiwan but for everyone – is not being pursued vigorously enough. Of course, we know that Beijing is blocking this; that stands to reason, but I do think it is very regrettable that whereas the Commission has taken, and continues to take, a clear stance here – and I thank Commissioner Wallström for the Commission's exemplary commitment on this issue – the Council can only be described as faint-hearted. On a serious issue such as health and epidemiology, this faint-heartedness on the part of the Council can cost lives. I therefore appeal to the Council of the European Union, to the governments of our Member States, to act resolutely so that Taiwan can join the World Health Organisation at last, and to ensure that these artificial obstacles are overcome. This is not a question of prestige; people's lives are at stake. (Applause

 Mr President, let me start by pointing out that the expression ‘to take the bull by the horns’ exists in German as well; we may not, alas, have bullfights, but we still have the metaphor. I am obliged to the President-in-Office of the Council for his very precise and very fine answer, and would like to put to him a supplementary question. If this development, namely the equal rights of these three ethnic groups being put on a firmer footing – which I very much desire – actually comes to pass, might another approach not be to make the structures rather less bureaucratic? Many Bosnians tell me that there are too many cantons, and that they are too small, something that is a result of an imbalance and leads to a large proportion of the gross national product and of international aid being swallowed up by excessive bureaucracy.

Commissioner, I wanted to put a question supplementary to Mr Ebner’s, one concerning development aid, which is your core responsibility. To what extent does water policy, relating not only to drinking water but also to water for agriculture, play a pivotal role in two especially important war zones that we have to deal with at present, namely the area around the Euphrates and the Tigris – which also involves Turkey – and the Palestinian problem as a whole? I wanted to ask you whether you are conducting separate negotiations in these areas, where water both has an important part to play in peacemaking and could also trigger armed conflicts.

 Just two more brief supplementary questions: firstly, does the Commission check to see that all the organisations that are promoted or supported do not, in fact, fund abortions?

 Mr President, Guatemala, home to an ancient culture, is a country that has, again and again, suffered grave setbacks. Recent history shows us that, ever since the murder, in the seventies, of the German ambassador Graf Spreti, who was a diplomat and politician of note, this region of Central America has repeatedly found itself under the spotlight of European and German public opinion and was battered by one crisis after another, to which any response came too late. We were always too late in responding to the bloody acts of violence, to the revolutions, and to the terrorism. So I thank Mr Liese and all the others who have taken the initiative in putting forward this masterpiece of pre-emptive diplomacy, a brief resolution which, for the first time, is not a reaction to a crisis of the sort with which we are familiar in our debates on topical and urgent matters – although there is of course an acute crisis going on. Primarily, though, this is about prevention, and, moreover, prevention through action rather than through words. It gets right to the core issues, these being the whole area of agriculture and the reforms that it needs. Secondly, it turns to economic reform and the area of fiscal legislation, which really is bizarre. The crucial thing is that it also embeds the peace process, to which the European Union can make a substantial contribution by supporting and setting up dialogue, as well, of course, as in the field of economic cooperation and development aid. I am very grateful for this initiative. It is my belief that the real task of this House is not always to merely condemn, but to actively endeavour to devise strategies for minimising disasters, or averting them completely.

Mr President, as a pan-European, I have had the good fortune to have been able to work towards this day since the 1970s and to assist Otto von Habsburg in ensuring that an empty chair was placed here in 1979 in protest against the exclusion of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe from the European Communities and as a signal for the process of reunification, the final stage of which we are initiating today. I had the good fortune not only to help prepare the pan-European picnic which was mentioned a few moments ago but also to play a part in the democratic revolutions in almost all of the applicant countries and in the declarations of Estonian and Slovenian independence. For this reason, let me state quite clearly that if we – a whole group of fellow Members and myself – deliver a critical vote on the Schröder report today, we are neither rejecting enlargement nor spurning the Czech people but are protesting, as people protested at the time, against injustice, against an injustice that still persists, against a serious infringement of human rights and its perpetuation through the continuing discriminatory effects of unjust decrees. For this reason, my friends, we say categorically that the European Union must continue to aspire to a common system of law. As a community rooted in the rule of law, we must ensure that unjust decrees are not brought into our legal system in the same way that viruses are introduced into computer systems. The virus endangers the entire system, which is why we, together with the countries that are about to accede to the Union, must fight in the period following today’s complex vote and after the accession of the new Member States to identify injustices where they still exist and to ensure that crime is recognised as crime and injustice as injustice. At the same time, we must cooperate in a spirit of partnership to create a Europe, a pan-European entity, that is built on the foundations of justice, peace and freedom. (Applause

 Madam President, I too support the excellent report by our colleague Mr Morillon, which integrates Atlanticism and Euro-Gaullism magnificently. As someone who is far more of a Euro-Gaullist than Mr Morillon, I concede that he has managed to combine these two elements of European foreign and security policy quite outstandingly. We cannot discuss the issue of European defence as if we were debating the need for a European directive on jam. What is at stake here is the very raison d'être
 of European integration. I am not the only one who thinks so; many of our citizens share this view, as the opinion polls bear out. The real purpose of European integration is peace and security, both internally and externally. For this reason, the time has come for us to make progress on the European foreign and security policy, and I am not as pessimistic about this as many others in this House. Yes, it is true that our governments have presented a pathetic picture. But if you look at public opinion in the various nations, it is apparent that on the key issues – including the Iraq war – there is far greater unanimity among the nations than among the governments. In my view, we need mechanisms and institutions which do not only capture the nations' common will but actively influence and shape it, for we cannot simply be led by the current mood. We need a responsible, long-term strategy as the basis for a common foreign and security policy. I think the Convention is the final opportunity, in the broad community of fifteen – soon to be twenty-five or thirty – Member States, to achieve a common foreign and security policy. I hope this will be successful. I do not want a core Europe. I do not want a fragmented Europe. Yet if this wider circle of Member States fails to make progress, there must be a development towards a core Europe. However, this means a core Europe which is open to all those who are willing to participate in a common foreign and security policy. Let me make one more thing clear: I believe that we need the Atlantic Alliance. However, as Franz-Josef Strauss, my party's late chairman, once said: ‘The Atlantic Alliance will only have a future if it is based on two equally strong and lasting pillars: an American pillar and a European pillar’. The fact that this European pillar does not exist is not the Americans' fault. It is our fault as Europeans. In the wake of the enlargement which we have agreed today, we will have more citizens than Russia and the USA put together. So it is high time we did something about our foreign and security policy, and that includes spending more and creating the appropriate structures. This does not mean structures of aggression, but structures which actively build peace. Painfully, we failed to do this in advance of the Iraq war, but it has been the European Union's mission since our founding fathers started it up in 1952.

 Mr President, I regret that this House has been unable to adopt a clear position on Iraq. I would therefore like to state my position for the record. I consider this war to be illegal, immoral and politically counterproductive.

 Mr President, this House has given a great deal of attention to Cambodia ever since the days of Pol Pot, the Stone Age Communist with a doctorate in philosophy from the Sorbonne. Since then, we have campaigned for the freedom of the Cambodian people, even after the Khmer Rouge had been replaced by the Vietnamese occupation, and, even when the situation appeared as hopeless as it did in the struggle against the regime imposed by the Khmer Rouge, we kept on supporting the human rights of the Cambodians. We did this in close collaboration with Son San, a grand old man of Cambodian democracy, who was a frequent visitor to this House. What is even more disturbing is that the current deterioration in the situation follows signs of hope in the shape of last year's local elections, which provided a firm basis, at least in the most general terms, for the beginnings of democracy, which can be established only from the ground upwards, that is, out of local communities, in many of which – fortunately enough – it is actually growing. What makes matters even worse is that repression from the centre outwards, that is, on the part of the government, is currently on the increase. This is linked to the regime's fear of democratic movements and of opposition; it has to do with the instability resulting from the unresolved issue of succession to the throne, and with many conflicts along ethnic and religious lines, on which point I have to say, in response to Mr Belder, that these conflicts are not just between Christians and Buddhists, but believers, Buddhist and Christian alike, are being persecuted, and we have to stand up for both of them. It is for this reason that I want to make it clear that, whilst our cooperation agreement with Cambodia was a step in the right direction, it was a pledge of our confidence, and such a pledge is justified only if the developments initiated by the United Nations, along with the rule of law and the beginnings of democracy, continue without interference. If, however, the elections on 27 July are taken as an occasion for putting leaders of the opposition in fear of their lives and limbs, and intimidating religious groups and ethnic minorities, then that is a lamentable development presaging a fearful backlash, and something that we cannot accept. So ‘yes’ to cooperation and to support for the fledgling democracy, but we also have to make it clear to our Cambodian partners that, if they jeopardise their democracy, they are also putting the European Union's cooperation at risk.

 Mr President, page 17 of the Minutes details what was said and done in yesterday's Question Time, which was announced on the screens only after it had begun three-quarters of an hour late. It should have been my turn half an hour after the beginning of Question Time, and, although I ran down here straight away, my question had already been dropped, as none of those down to put questions in the first half-hour had been there. I then asked that my question should be allowed anyway, as it was the question immediately following it that was being dealt with, but the President stuck to the rules with extreme rigour. I would just like to say that you should either stick strictly to the rules – which means that you start Question Time punctually – or else, if you are going to be sloppy anyway, you have to exercise some liberality in these matters. That is the first thing I wanted to say, and I ask you to see to it that I do not get the standard reminder telling me that I should have been present at Question Time, for, if I do, I will have to reply to it in somewhat personal terms. Now for the second point that I wanted to mention in this context: Mr Puerta, who was presiding yesterday, promised me and Mr Salafranca, who had the same problem, that we would get written answers – which represents a deviation from customary practice – and I would ask you to ensure that this promise, at any rate, is kept to.

 Mr President, I would first like to apologise. The interpretation referred to Questions Nos 1 to 3, which is why I asked to speak. So the reason was an error in the interpreting. Please accept my apology. But I would now like to put my question to the President-in-Office, whom I wish to thank for his very concrete and helpful reply. I have two short supplementary questions. The first is to ask what you think of the idea of simply setting up a working group to consider the options for the future of Kosovo. That would give us a preventive role and stop us from once again reacting only when it was too late. The second question is this: as far as I am aware, the preamble of the new constitution of Serbia and Montenegro includes a claim by Serbia that Kosovo should in future be a part of the Yugoslavian sub-state of Serbia. I would like to ask whether the European Union or the United Nations have protested against this. I ask because this would prejudice the chances of keeping open the future status of Kosovo.

 Mr President, I would ask you to call my question again, and for the following reason: I was here at 5.30 p.m. and the debate was still in full swing. I then went to another meeting. As soon as I saw that Question Time was starting and Mr Prodi had finished speaking I rushed here from that meeting, but the first part – which according to our documents was supposed to last 30 minutes – was already over. I really would therefore crave your indulgence. In such cases it is extremely difficult, even for someone like myself who endeavours to attend Question Time on every occasion, to be here on the dot ready for this procedure. I would therefore ask you to call my question again. (Applause)

 Mr President, I just wanted to clarify three points: firstly, Commissioner Verheugen is still here. Secondly – and this is also an important point – you made an exception at the last part-session. I will check in the Minutes to see which Member was concerned. I have a very clear recollection of this precedent being set. Thirdly, I should like to say that I would request that Question Time begin, as in previous years, at 5.30 p.m. precisely, regardless of what is happening in plenary. That was the practice in this House for almost 20 years and it was something that we could rely on. But being sloppy about the start time, only then to be strict when applying this rule, and extreme when interpreting it, is not something that I can accept. Either you are liberal in both cases or strict in both cases!

 Mr President, if I am not mistaken all of those who have drafted motions or spoken in this debate so far are from the Romance part of Europe. This shows the particular solidarity that they feel, but I actually also want to make it clear that this problem of Venezuela concerns all Europeans to at least some degree. Venezuela is a country that plays a significant role, and not only in economic terms thanks to its raw materials, oil and many other natural resources. It is a country that has made a very considerable contribution to the political stability of the Andean region over a very long period of time. That is why I welcome the efforts that Europe is making to help this country to recover its internal stability by intervening here. I should particularly like to thank Mr Salafranca and others for being so ready to take on this task time and time again, and I believe that there are two points in this motion that are very significant. Firstly, emphasis is placed on the role of the Friends of Venezuela, this group of countries that is making a particular effort to offer mediation here. Two countries in the European Union, namely Spain and Portugal, belong to this group and have a special responsibility here, which they are responding to magnificently. I should like to thank them for this and say that the European Union hopes that Spain and Portugal really can play a pivotal and positive role here, and I am convinced that they will do so. Secondly, the motion stresses how important it is for the European Parliament itself to have a presence on the spot. I should like to underline this request and say that the European Parliament certainly does not want to interfere in politics the world over, but it does wish to offer good mediation services wherever a reasonably well-functioning democracy is in danger because it is under threat from populism on the one hand and fear and uncertainty on the other. The various different political forces need to be brought together around one table, because only by strengthening the rule of law, only by strengthening the institutions, but also only by strengthening pluralism in this troubled country will we once again be able to avoid a serious crisis there, and the lasting damage that this would do to that country and the region as a whole. As I said, I would therefore appeal for the European Parliament's offer to act as a mediator to be accepted. I do not mean that we want to go around telling other nations what to do. We do not have the right to do that, but we do have the duty to make our good offices available and to act as mediators.

 Mr President, I do not want to oppose a debate on Iraq, but your proposal involves cancelling Question Time in order to have one, and I very much want to put my opposition to that on the record, taking as I do the view that every individual MEP's right to put questions – enshrined, indeed, in the treaties – is one of the most important parliamentary rights, second only to the right to vote on legislative texts. We are becoming accustomed to important matters – it is always important matters – ever more frequently reducing or doing away with the time available for questions. I ask you to put a stop to this practice. Questions to the Council used to be held at 9 p.m., or from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m., and for ten to fifteen years that worked perfectly, until the Council decided it was tired in the evenings and had to leave, so that Question Time was moved to the afternoon, and since then, Question Time has been cut back or moved, always to make room for other items of business. I ask you to take a long-term approach to this problem, and to sort it out.

 Mr President, a few days ago, I visited our future member state, Cyprus, which is half–way between Athens and the Iraq–Kuwait border. Lebanon is just a stone's throw away. This shows how important Lebanon is for us in the European Union. If we recall that Beirut was once the cultural and economic centre of the Eastern Mediterranean, this shows that we, as Europeans, have a real interest in a stable Lebanon. I therefore greatly welcome the adoption of this agreement and believe that it will contribute substantially to stabilising a country which is very significant for Europe. Its cultural diversity and its economic power, which is slowly developing once more, are important for us. I think it is in the Europeans' interests to support Prime Minister Hariri's development drive, and as regards the Mediterranean–Europe Parliamentary Assembly, I believe it should be constituted in Beirut, in order to send out a signal that we recognise and support these efforts to overcome the challenges of terrorism and occupation which undoubtedly exist.

Madam President, Equatorial Guinea has unfortunately been a negative example of an African country for decades, but sadly it is not an isolated case. We must recognise quite clearly that we have a very substantial responsibility here. Of course, there are abuses of power, corruption, and dictatorial violations of any attempt at the rule of law in that country. That is absolutely correct and we must vigorously condemn them. Yet on the other hand, we ourselves have a responsibility, because this country – like many other African countries – has become a pawn in the international competition for resources, and unfortunately, this involves European interests as well. The major role played by the oil companies in Equatorial Guinea, but also the diamond trade – and illegal trades such as human trafficking play a part there too – unfortunately destabilise the country as well. Ethnic and political conflicts – although these are generally rooted in ethnic conflicts – are exploited in a cynical policy designed to safeguard resource supplies. For this reason, I think that paragraph 7 of the resolution is extremely important, for we have a responsibility here, and we also have opportunities to exert influence. We genuinely need the proposed report on the oil companies' role. I do not endorse the call for an outright boycott and the cessation of all financial assistance. As a rule, such measures impact not on the dictators, but – if they have any impact at all – on the people of this already benighted country. I completely agree with my Spanish colleague on this point. I believe that we must vigorously condemn the abuse of power. Nonetheless, we must also seek dialogue with President Obiang in order to achieve a situation in which the opposition can gradually resume its work and the exiled politicians can return home. We must also work to ensure that the planned conference on reforming the judicial system can take place. Unless we start with very basic institution–building in this country – as we sought to do in European countries, as in Kosovo and Bosnia–Herzegovina, where conditions are far more straightforward and stable – we will never achieve any success. We cannot apply European standards overnight in Equatorial Guinea; this will take decades of development, which have yet to commence. This is why, as I have already said, the next steps are dialogue with President Obiang, supporting the conference on the judicial system, the release of the opposition, legalising opposition parties, and fresh elections with international supervision. These are the next steps we must take, but it would be disastrous if we now tried to run before we could walk. I therefore recommend a measured approach. Simply imposing sanctions is not a solution. Above all, we should not point the finger at others; we should accept our own responsibility first, and that means examining the role played by our oil companies in what is sadly a very dirty game.

Mr President, for the third time in history, a systematic attempt at genocide is taking place in Chechnya. It is being committed by the Russian colonial power in order to safeguard its strategic interests and resources. The fact that this is camouflaged as a war on terrorism – even if there is terrorism there – is simply a cynical distortion of reality. This is why it is important that there should be unfettered access to the war region so that the facts can be presented. We are currently witnessing a situation in which the Russian power is doing its utmost to ensure that this war fades from sight behind a wall of silence. First of all, the Commission has so far been unwilling to visit the region. We have discussed the matter time and again with Commissioner Nielson and urged him to visit the region. It may be that some influence has already been brought to bear behind the scenes here. Then we said that we as a Parliament wanted to visit the region. Our parliamentary delegation was then prevented from travelling to the crisis region for a variety of completely threadbare reasons. This was not just deplorable, to paraphrase the mild criticism voiced in the resolution before us. It was a scandal. We are supposed to have a partnership with Russia. That means that just as our partner Russia has the right and the opportunity to travel anywhere in the EU to gather first–hand information, we expect to have the same free and unimpeded access in Russia's sphere of influence at any time, in line with all the international conventions which Russia has signed, not least in the OSCE and the Council of Europe. The third attempt to construct a wall of silence around Chechnya was the ending of the OSCE mission and the ejection of an international organisation which had made a major contribution to ending the previous Chechen war through a negotiated settlement. It was, after all, under the OSCE's supervision, that President Maskhadov was elected, and, as he is the only representative to have been elected democratically to date, we cannot deny him dialogue. Then a German delegation led by Norbert Blüm, the well–respected former German minister, was thrown out as well. Mr President, I find this absolutely scandalous, and I think we should be speaking a clearer language here than we have done so far. We must make it clear to the Russians that this cannot continue. We want to shine light into the darkness and we want an end to this war. (Applause)

 Mr President, today, a fortuitous left-wing majority of five votes has done damage to the cause of human rights. I take the view that one can have the most divergent views on all issues of policy, but I regard a polarisation of this sort on human rights as being intrinsically malignant. We should be consistent in concerning ourselves with real violations of human rights and real discrimination, and doing so consensually and on the basis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, rather than letting this House be divided into two equal and mutually antagonistic ideological camps. In my view, the cause of human rights is too important for a community founded on law and human rights to allow that to be done to it. That is why I voted against this report. Not everything that has human rights on the cover is actually about human rights, and if we want to lay down how the monks on Mount Athos organise access to their monasteries, regulate religious communities, and force Member States to accept certain definitions of marriage and the family that many of us – myself included – fundamentally repudiate, then that has nothing to do with human rights, but rather with ideology, and it is ideology that has not been neglected in this report.

Mr President, I have been happy to vote for Mr Pirker's report, seeing that it carries on work that I did in 1998, when we adopted the report – in my name at the time – on eastward enlargement and internal security, which for the first time elaborated the idea of a European Corps of Border Guards. Since then, substantial progress has been made on the part of the Member States by way of the Italian feasibility study, and on the part of the Commission by way of this communication, for which I thank Commissioner Vitorino. This, though, is only the first step in the right direction, and I would like to make it abundantly clear that I am putting the case for our pressing for a truly European border protection force, for a European Corps of Border Guards with a basis in Community law and financed on a Community basis, for anything else would be nothing more than a hotchpotch. As far as the proposed educational institution is concerned, I suggest that resources should be combined and duplication of work avoided by using the Police Academy, also proposed in the 1998 report and already up and running. I believe this would get us on the right track. Crime is organised internationally, and we have to, at long last, organise the combating of crime on a Community and cross-border basis.

Mr President, I would like to start by asking when a final decision will be taken on the seat of the Police Academy. You may well be aware that Parliament, at my suggestion, proposed this Police Academy in 1998 and brought it into being. We actually thought it should be sited in the border zone between the present-day EU and the candidate countries. So the first question is: when is a decision going to be taken about the Academy's eventual location? My second question is on border control, and it is this: what is your view of a specifically European legal basis for the control of Europe's borders? And for my third point: is the managing body for integrated European border control, which you have just mentioned, to have a permanent base, and if so, where is it to be?

 Mr President, the OSCE has, as we know, been expelled. Even though he had a visa, the German ex-minister Norbert Blüm was sent back by the Russian authorities while he was on his way to Chechnya, and the delegation from this Parliament was barred from the Duma. The Russians do not want anyone in the region. What I want to ask you is this: Could the Council not put pressure on Russia, so that a delegation could travel to Chechnya as soon as possible, with the Commission represented by Commissioner Nielson or some other Commissioner, accompanied by members of Parliament and the Council, in order to gather information on the ground? The Russians can get first-hand information in the European Union anywhere and at any time. We want our Russian partners to accord us the same right of being able to inform ourselves where and as things are happening.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to add something to what has just been said. Only a matter of a few decades ago, Angola was one of Africa's principal agricultural exporters, and this of course means that it is appalling that we now have to supply it with food aid – a situation brought about by both war and socialist mismanagement of the economy. There are three questions I would like to put to you. Firstly, what actual agricultural programmes is the Commission implementing? That, in my view, is the most important thing, that the country can again be self-supporting and export agricultural produce. Secondly, what is the state of the infrastructure that is needed to distribute the food? And thirdly, what is happening about educational and training programmes? These are, I believe, the three most important issues that are at stake here.

 Commissioner, I too am aware that Kosovo's present status is laid down in the UN Resolution, but the simple fact is that we also have to consider the future, and that is where I can envisage a problem, in that no major investor will put money into Kosovo if he does not know what sort of long-term future the place has to look forward to. If people cannot see what prospects there are for the country, they will carry on trying to emigrate, rather than investing their energies in Kosovo itself. Hence this question: is there any sort of dialogue between the European Union and the representatives of Kosovo, in which these issues are at least considered? After all, the present position cannot remain as it is for decades at a stretch, and we cannot go sliding, without any sort of forward planning, into a future that will be with us very soon.

 Madam President, as others have already said, these death sentences have absolutely nothing to do with the war on terrorism. However, that also demonstrates that we have a responsibility to wage that war. The United States also bears that responsibility within the international institutions, the United Nations and under international law. If you only fight terrorism – and that is unfortunately a danger that also exists in Washington – strictly by means of a coalition of the major powers, there is a risk that those powers will misuse that war on terror for their own ends: Moscow will use it against the Chechens and Beijing will use it against Tibet. We need to be fully aware that the sort of repression that has been practised in Tibet or in Chechnya is no way to fight terrorism, it will simply engender it. We were talking earlier on about mountain regions. A few decades back there were even bomb attacks here in the Community, in the South Tyrol, which is nowadays a peaceful model region of Europe of which we can be proud. There were even extremist movements in our European democracies. That sounds unlikely today, because by granting autonomy we have ensured that no one takes separatist or terrorist action. We now feel comfortable in the greater community of Europeans and regard ourselves as being at the heart of Europe. My message to the Chinese is therefore this: ‘Give the Tibetans autonomy, give them democracy, and give them human rights!’ That is the way to fight terrorism and separatism. That is a successful approach that will not lead to terrorism but will genuinely bring peace and ensure that peace will prevail in the world's most important and most historically precious mountain region, peace that can be a model for the entire world. The motion for a resolution before us has much to recommend it, but the wording is rather infelicitous, by which I mean the phrase ‘the Tibetan minority in China’. Of course, in comparison with China's massive population, we are all minorities. However, what we are talking about here is the great Tibetan people with its ancient world culture, which is a valuable heritage for mankind. We appeal to the Chinese to respect this people and its culture as full partners, just as we treat the Tibetans and Chinese as equals. (Applause)

Firstly, can you give some kind of guarantee – one can of course never give an absolute one – that the humanitarian aid is actually reaching the Chechen refugees, or are you relying completely on the Russian authorities for that?

 Mr President, we have to bear in mind that the situation in Sudan varies greatly depending on the region. In the north we are dealing with a problematic regime, which is however displaying clear reformist tendencies, and which is supported by Egypt. In the south we have a brutal and bloody civil war, which it would be too simplistic to describe solely as a conflict between Islam and Christianity. There are also conflicts amongst Muslims themselves and amongst Christian tribes, although the main conflict is indeed between Christians and Muslims. This shows that this is not actually a war of religion but a series of tribal conflicts, ethnic conflicts, and that interested parties, including interested parties in the oil industry – for once this must be said – are systematically fanning the flames of these conflicts. That is why I am very grateful that the motion addresses this issue very clearly: the problematic role of certain parties who have interests in the natural resources – we have seen this in the Caucasus and in Congo too – and who are abusing ethnic conflicts to brutally increase their own profits. That is why as Europeans we are not only under a particular obligation to influence the people in Sudan, to work with them on a peace solution and to exert pressure on all of the parties in the conflict, but we also have a duty to hold serious talks with our European oil companies operating out there and to make it clear to them how great their responsibility is for this strategically important region and for the people who live there.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would thank my colleague Mr Lisi for the report he has presented on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds in paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products. His report very sensibly complements the Commission’s proposal in many areas, especially when it comes to the sensitive interfaces between economics, ecology, consumer protection and safety in the work place. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in this case hydrocarbons, have a considerable part to play in the formation of ground-level ozone. Emissions are also formed from components of products containing solvents. In many Member States, health problems in connection with ground-level ozone and smog have increased considerably in recent years. In the case of sensitive population groups, ozone pollution may lead to irritation of the eyes, sore throats and breathing problems. In the environment, account is to be taken of effects upon photosynthesis. I support the Commission’s initiative to introduce Community-wide measures for reducing VOC emissions. I consider the product-related approach selected here to be basically sensible. The fact is also to be welcomed that 70% of decorative paints are now water-based. I also expressly support the extension of the directive, agreed to by a significant majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, to include dangerous substances in addition to volatile organic compounds present in paints, varnishes and vehicle refinishing products. This approach would combine necessary measures in a single directive and prevent unnecessary bureaucratic expenditure. If the dangerous substances are, however, incorporated into the directive, it must also still be possible realistically and sustainably to apply the required minimum standards, that is to say the minimum and maximum values. What, then, we are talking about is optimum environmental and consumer protection without, in the process, endangering the competitiveness of our European paint industry, as well as the painting trade that is closely bound up with it. That being said, jobs would also be endangered by the attempt, which goes far beyond the Commission’s proposal, to replace dangerous substances, either fully or to a greater extent, by the year 2010 Europe-wide. That is a threat to the entire paint industry, and first and foremost to small- and medium-sized enterprises, as well as a severe setback for our European economic area. With a view to protecting the health of users and consumers, volatile organic solvents and dissolvents should not, however, be replaced by substances that are dangerous to health. Injury to consumers’ health due to problematic new ingredients such as allergens, or long-lasting damage to interiors due to heavily volatile components of decorative paints, must, in any case, be prevented. Environmental and consumer protection have the highest priority. The quality and usability of products ought not, however, to suffer in the process. If the principle of rapid and complete replacement were really to be put into practice, we should have to accept some crucial losses of quality, especially in the cases of paints and varnishes. I personally would not expect either myself or anyone else in the European Union to accept a situation in which the varnish on the door of a private house soon flakes just as quickly as the paints on the wall of the house fade. We need a reduction in solvents and dangerous substances in paints and varnishes, but we need a plan that can be put into practice. It is technically impossible to reduce the proportion of volatile organic solvents to below 300 grams per litre by 2007 and still further by 2010, but it is technically possible and sensible to reduce the proportion of these substances to 400 grams per litre by 2007 and to a permissible maximum value of 300 grams per litre by 2010. At the same time, reasonable maximum values need to be applied to limit the side effects caused by the inhalation of paints and varnishes by tradesmen and handymen. The purpose of the directive must be to employ practicable measures in order, in the medium term, to reduce the proportion of paint and varnish solvents in emissions Europe-wide.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele have produced a comprehensive piece of work, which should make for better information and greater transparency, as well as helping European consumers to enjoy freedom of choice. Consumers have to know what they are buying and what they are eating. Effective, reliable legal framework conditions for authorising, labelling and tracing GMOs need to be created as soon as possible. Both regulations, along with the lifting of the de facto 
moratorium on authorisation, are crucial to the implementation of a forward-looking strategy for European biotechnology, demands for which Parliament endorsed at the beginning of this year. The moratorium impedes the progress of green biotechnology in the European Union, and, in particular, both damages Europe’s innovative SMEs and stands in contradiction to the Lisbon objectives. The room for action set out in compromise motion No 1 on the Scheele report is desirable. We must, however, ensure that, if individual Member States decide to go their own way, this does not frustrate the aims of this regulation by interfering with the common internal market. When it comes to the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs in non-genetically-modified products, we need rules that work in practice. In the final analysis, as we all know, every threshold value we set is arbitrary, but the 0.9% threshold value provided for in the Common Position is reasonable and helps to guide manufacturers and consumers. The threshold value is important in terms of different types of cultivation being able to coexist, as, in the natural world, there are no techniques for preventing such things as cross-pollination. The most important yardstick by which the new legislation must be judged must be the practicability of its framework conditions, which must, in particular, be in line with WTO rules and must not allow excessive bureaucracy to hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe. Above all, they must help to inform consumers and protect them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Corbey has presented for its second reading a report the essentials of which I can endorse. We need the best possible systems to deal with what amounts to some 58 million tonnes of packaging material produced every year in the European Union, an amount that is increasing from year to year. In so doing, we would be ensuring that the environment is better cared for and giving important sectors of industry the security to plan ahead. Among those we will be voting on tomorrow, there is one amendment that I regard as particularly important. Amendment No 4 has to do with packaging materials in small quantities, which are therefore subject to a very low market penetration in the Member States. One material that occurs in small quantities of this sort is ceramic packaging; for example, ceramic bottles, pots, and bowls made in the Netherlands, in France and in Spain, are mainly used for the packaging of brandies, chocolates, and patés. Ceramic packaging accounts for only 0.1% of the packaging waste produced in the EU – in other words, just 58 000 tonnes out of 58 million tonnes. Ceramics consist of baked clay, and their artistic and creative appearance means that, in many households, they are kept or re-used, so that they do not end up in the household rubbish. Ceramics can be neither re-used in the production of energy nor recycled. They pose no problems for the environment. To treat ceramics separately, collecting them and transporting them thousands of kilometres across the Member States, would make no sense either in environmental or in economic terms. I therefore urge you to support Amendment No 4. Waste management, which was already introduced on the basis of this directive, or which has yet to be introduced in certain Member States, should deal with those materials that are suited to recovery; it must concentrate on materials the collection and recycling of which is profitable in economic and environmental terms.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank my colleague, Mr Schnellhardt, who has drawn upon his professional background to produce a very technically sound report. Adequate food controls are important in order to guarantee the greatest possible protection of consumers. They ensure the safety, for example, of raw meat, game, molluscs, milk and dairy products. In future, therefore, food producers and processors will have to reveal all the different steps involved in their work. Details will have to be noted about the feedingstuffs used and the state of health of the animals. It will then be possible to trace food and its component parts back to the place of origin, in accordance with the transparent production chain. This is the only way for food authorities to react faster when there is a problem or to detect shortcomings in quality as soon as possible and to remove them. In the Commission’s proposal, it is emphasised that small- and medium-sized enterprises are most affected, and, for them, the new hygiene rules represent a huge burden. The increase in expenditure will, however, result in a significant increase in food safety for the consumer, provided that the demands on businesses are bearable and affordable. Against this background, the rapporteur and I have jointly tabled some amendments, which take into consideration the flexibility that is essential for artisanal small businesses without, however, reducing the hygiene requirements. I think it is important that these artisanal small businesses should be recognised in the definition of the Regulation. We do have large slaughterhouses in Europe, but we also have a host of small butcher’s shops. That is why there has to be some flexibility to adapt official controls to the size of the business. Inspecting a large slaughterhouse, in which thousands of animals are slaughtered and processed on a daily basis, is in nature and intensity different to inspecting an artisanal small business, in which fewer animals are processed. There also has to be flexibility with regard to the frequency of controls on smaller businesses. We need a rule stipulating when a business is to be inspected and by whom. An inspection plan from the competent authorities, which has been preceded by a risk analysis, should be sufficient. Health-based requirements should only be involved if they are actually relevant for people’s health. What I expect from this Regulation is greater individual responsibility for producers and processors. European consumers will benefit directly from this. However, I am also very concerned that we, as legislators, should give consideration to the traditional small-business structure in Europe, in order to guarantee that both the production and supply of food is sustainable, adequate and safe, even in the less-populated areas of Europe.

 Today, the European Parliament has voted to accept the accession of ten states to the European Union. This is an historic day, not only for Europe, but also for me personally. The calamitous division of Europe is being overcome, and Europe is being united in peace and freedom. The peoples of Europe now have the opportunity to join together in shaping their future in freedom and under democracy. I have nonetheless voted today against the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union, and I would like to explain why I have done so. I have voted today against the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU, and I would like to explain that this was not a ‘no’ to the Czech people, but rather a deliberate sign to the political office-holders who, despite many demands that they should do so – from their own people, among others – were unwilling to abandon passages in the Beneš decrees that are contrary to human rights. My electoral district is in the Oberpfalz, a border region which shares some 140 kilometres of border with the Czech Republic, and one where many have built up a new life after being driven from their homes in Bohemia and Moravia. I know how strong are the ties that bind these expellees to their former homes, and to family members and friends who still live in the Czech Republic and to whom the Czech ‘Immunity Act’ remains applicable.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to argue realistically – not emotionally, and certainly not ideologically. Plant protection agents contain substances that protect cultivated plants and keep them free of pests and diseases, and they can be applied and used in many ways. They are often indispensable in vegetable and fruit growing and in viticulture, for a producer's economic yield is essentially dependent on a good harvest, on which a business relies for its income and its survival. We cannot therefore take away from users the option of using plant protection agents where necessary. It is clear to all of us that the effects of plant protection agents are not only beneficial. They can also involve hazards to human health and to the environment. Ten years ago, we enacted at EU level our own directive on plant protection agents, which stipulates in the most precise terms which active agent may be used on which plant and for what purpose. The Commission communication is supplementary to it, aims to manage risks better, and is therefore a step in absolutely the right direction. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses measures to further train farmers in state-of-the-art and targeted applications of plant protection agents, promotion of alternative concepts such as what is termed integrated crop management, harmonisation of VAT rates on plant protection agents in order to remove existing distortions of competition in the internal market, careful disposal of packaging and expert testing of agricultural machinery, for we see it as particularly important to maintain the purity of our drinking water. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is, in principle, in favour of the proper and up-to-date use of plant protection agents. Risks can be reduced only if cooperation between producers, users and the authorities is maximised. Mrs Van Brempt's report goes beyond the Commission communication. Above all else, a legally-binding 50% reduction in the use of plant protection agents would involve additional risks. Experts have warned that such a reduction encourages the development of resistance. The resultant higher incidence of weeds then makes it necessary to use plant protection agents in larger quantities. As Mrs Redondo Jiménez pointed out earlier, the use of an active agent is, however, far more a matter of location, local weather conditions and a plant's general condition in terms of development and health. An obligatory levy on plant protection agents certainly does not minimise risks in real terms, any more than would the introduction of a pesticides passport and a total ban on spraying from the air. Any such ban would impose severe limitations, especially in viticulture. Ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats cannot support the points I have just mentioned in Mrs Van Brempt's report. I therefore ask the Members of this House to support a realisable and practicable approach, one that will reduce risk without hindering users in their work, for Europe's fruit, vegetable and cereal farmers produce food for us all.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, very much for her excellent report and for the remarkably good cooperation, also on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, who cannot be here today for an important reason, namely an investiture ceremony in the Netherlands. She sends her apologies. Breast implants are covered by the directive on medical devices. I am very pleased that the Commission – as Commissioner Byrne also explained earlier – has recently announced that it is reclassifying breast implants and is pressing for higher levels of safety for patients. Broadly speaking, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can support the Commission Communication and the report tabled by Mrs Stihler. We have to face up to the following fact in Europe: every year 160 000 women in the European Union suffer from breast cancer. It affects one in eight women. In Germany alone, that means over 50 000 women every year. Parliament is acutely aware of how topical and sensitive this issue is. In the post-operative care of breast cancer patients, breast implants are often a decisive factor in increasing their quality of life. Where breast abnormalities and surgical beauty treatments are concerned, the options available must also be explained and safety guaranteed. We are therefore calling for a number of decisive measures to be taken, above and beyond the Commission's proposals. It is essential for a minimum age to be set for cosmetic breast operations. These should not be carried out on young women under the age of 18. Operations for medical reasons would be exempt. In addition, advertising for such implants that is directed at the general public should be banned along the lines of the French model. It would then only be permitted to publish objective information in a non-commercial context. It must be guaranteed that advice and information will be provided prior to the operation by a doctor specialising in plastic surgery. We think it is vital for this meeting to take place at least four to six weeks before an appointment is agreed for the operation, so as to give the women concerned a cooling-off period to reflect on the objective and reliable information that they have received. As in other areas, more emphasis needs to be given to providing patients with information. Before the operation date is agreed, the women concerned should therefore also be given an information sheet. It is important for this to be based on the content already developed by EQUAM. It should contain both a warning about the potential health risks and also a clear appeal only to agree an operation date once all remaining questions are fully resolved. This is also the point made in the amendment that I have tabled to paragraph 9 of the report. Where silicon implants are concerned, we need high standards of safety and quality at international level. For this reason, we need cross-border registration of breast implants to be made compulsory at international level. In this context, the EU Member States should be advised to become members of the international breast implant register. The scientific research carried out over the last few years has yielded some decisive findings in this field. We therefore also think it is important to support this research and guarantee that the scientific work continues across Europe. Overall the Commission Communication, together with the amendments proposed by Parliament, constitutes an important step in the right direction. It is not a question of making it more difficult to use breast implants, for either medical or cosmetic reasons. The aim of this initiative is to guarantee the highest levels of product safety, ensure that comprehensive information is provided and ultimately to increase the quality of life of the women concerned.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, herbal medicinal products have been used throughout the world for many centuries. In Europe, too, consumers' interest has extended far beyond the household remedies which are customarily used in individual regions. Many people swear by these natural products, whether they are Chinese ginseng root or Indian tea tree oil. In the European Union, however, herbal medicinal products are not yet regulated on a uniform basis. In some Member States, they have to be authorised, whereas in others, facilitated evidence of efficacy is sufficient. Mr Nisticò has presented a very good report which creates broadly uniform provisions governing the manufacture, marketing and labelling of herbal medicinal products and sets high quality and safety standards. In this context, the following points are especially important. First of all, there is the issue of quality and safety. The manufacturers of herbal medicinal products must provide evidence of their safety in the same way as is required for chemical medicinal products. In the simplified authorisation procedure, the efficacy and harmlessness of a product are proven through its long, that is, traditional, use. We also need a new committee on herbal medicinal products within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. This committee should take over responsibility for the full range of tasks relating to herbal medicinal products. It will establish herbal monographs relevant for the precise but speedy evaluation of the applications for authorisation. The proposal before us not only enables us to achieve broadly uniform authorisation criteria in Europe; it also allows us to facilitate the marketing of herbal medicinal products in all Member States while maintaining subsidiarity. European consumers can continue to choose from a broad range of products which have been submitted by the manufacturer in accordance with the legal provisions and have been carefully scrutinised and authorised by the authorities. This guarantees product quality and protects human health to the greatest possible extent.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly welcome the Commission's objective of again giving the EU a leading role in the field of life sciences and biotechnology. However, the proposed strategy lags far behind expectations. I would therefore like to thank Mrs Damião very much for her comprehensive report which clarifies the Commission's strategy document in many respects. Europe must take on a pro-active role once again if it is not to lose ground in this sophisticated area of technology. This applies especially to 'green' genetic engineering – in other words, to agriculture. A prerequisite is the establishment of an effective, predictable and stable legal framework, both for agriculture and for the biotech industry in Europe. This framework must comply, in particular, with WTO rules and safeguard the coexistence of all forms of agricultural production. The removal of the de facto moratorium for product approvals is the precondition for more planning security for companies and the agricultural sector. The moratorium is especially harmful to innovative SMEs in Europe and conflicts with the Lisbon objectives. Within the Commission, and within the European institutions, a targeted European policy to promote a ‘B-Europe’ 
policy must be promoted. Based on the successful concept of e
Europe, these same priorities could be pursued on an overarching basis by several of the Commission's Directorates-General. Further key points include: support for the development of bioclusters and other models for technological transfer, easier access to risk capital, especially for start-ups and SMEs in biotech research, the introduction of a European patent, and a transparent and scientifically based information policy on the part of the authorities, companies and the scientific establishment.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is important, in the light of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's question, to remember that we are discussing the adventitious presence of GMOs which are licensed in the European Union. We are not discussing the release of GMOs, but the definition of a further quality standard in the marketing of conventional seed. Parliament adopted the proposal for a regulation on the traceability and labelling of GMOs or genetically modified food and feedingstuffs at first reading in June, calling for a threshold value of 0.5%. I agree with the Commission here that this value is pitched too low and is impracticable. A tolerance threshold of 1% for the adventitious presence of GMOs in non-GM products is realistic. In setting threshold values for seed, which is what we are discussing here, the Commission has to take due account of Parliament's and the Council's suggested thresholds in the procedure mentioned. The threshold values for the adventitious presence of GMOs need to be coordinated in the two texts. I should also like to stress that uncontrolled reproduction represents another particular and potential source of GMOs in food and feed. Reproduction seed is not subject to any mandatory quality testing and is not therefore tested for the presence of GMOs. That needs to be made perfectly clear here. The Commission's biotechnology strategy sets the coexistence of various types of cultivation as an important priority. Coexistence is only possible if we have reasonable threshold values as, technically, wind-borne pollen can never be discounted in nature. One hundred percent purity was never possible for biological reasons and never will be in the future. Threshold values for product purity are standard and necessary in numerous industries. In the organic farming sector, for example, there is a threshold value of 5%. That means that products labelled as organic products may contain up to 5% of certain non-organic ingredients. I say that for the benefit of the Greens. The important criterion must be that the statutory framework is practicable. More importantly, it must be in keeping with WTO rules and must not hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe by tying it up in unnecessary red tape.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like thank Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller for their very full reports. Tomorrow we will be voting on the most important revision package to date as regards legislation on medicinal products in the European Union. The key objectives here are as follows: first, achieving a high level of health protection and giving patients rapid access to innovative products; second, the quality, safety and effectiveness of medicinal products in Europe; and, third, further dismantling existing barriers to trade within the internal market. Medicinal products need to be used appropriately and correctly. That is why it is vital for the law to make a clear distinction between information and advertising. All product information should be scientifically checked before it is published. Provisions relating to medicinal products should only apply to products that have a therapeutic benefit and are used therapeutically. Any overlap with food law should be avoided in order to obviate legal uncertainty. For this reason a clear definition of medicinal products and food is urgently needed, as provided for in Amendments Nos 11 and 18. The achievements of industrial research as regards innovative therapeutic uses should be recognised by means of appropriate data exclusivity for what are termed ‘original products’. I am, however, also supporting Amendment No 40, which grants existing medicinal products an additional three years' data exclusivity in the event of a new indication. Generic drugs, which must of course meet all requirements as regards quality, safety and effectiveness, should also be established in the European market and it should be possible to market them as soon as the period of protection for the original drug has expired. The authorisation procedure is to retain the option of choice between the centralised and decentralised procedures, which has existed since 1995. It has resulted in a marked increase in the efficiency of the authorisation procedures and has not led to the polarisation that some feared. It is essential that mutual recognition should continue for the sake of Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises. We need to create a system that promotes innovation in the interests of all patients. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was in the year 2000 that the European Union signed the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, an international agreement which is now to be implemented, and as quickly as possible. The Protocol aims, by applying international rules to trade in living GMOs, to prevent effects detrimental to biodiversity and to human health. It governs the safe transfer, handling and use of genetically modified organisms, placing the emphasis on their movement across borders. For this there is to be a procedure involving the prior informed consent of the importing country. In the case of GMOs intended for immediate use as foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, or for processing, it envisages notification to the Commission or to the Biosafety Clearing House. The Regulation's provisions will apply only to export to third countries outside the European Union. Community law already applies to imports into the European Union and to trade between its Member States. The future EU Regulation should be as strictly as possible in accordance with the Protocol's requirement, in order to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy and for uniform international standards to create legal certainty. It must, at the same time, be ensured that European export businesses do not, as a result, face formalities additional to those with which they must already comply when exporting to third countries. The report that Mr Sjöstedt has presented has, however, largely lost sight of the aim of maintaining biodiversity. Of the many demands contained in it, some, on the one hand, go far beyond what the Cartagena Protocol requires, whilst others attempt to artificially restrict trade in living GMOs. I see it as inexpedient to incorporate into the Regulation requirements relating to traceability and liability, as these issues are currently being debated in the course of a separate legislative procedure and therefore do not belong in this Regulation. The Protocol takes for granted the exclusion of GMOs exported for use in closed systems from the complicated and expensive notification procedure. No such provision is present in this report, or in the Commission proposal. That is why I, along with Mrs Sommer and Mr Purvis, am reintroducing the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee's Amendment No 50, which we ask you to support. It is my conviction that GMOs used in laboratories and not released into the environment represent no danger to biodiversity or to human health, and should therefore be excluded from the notification procedure. Our Amendment No 51 calls for further derogations from the notification procedure in order to avoid unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles hampering trade in GMOs. Moreover, the Regulation must follow the Cartagena Protocol as closely as possible in order to create greater legal certainty for international trade. That is why GMOs in respect of which the importing country has already granted an exporter a license, and GMOs in respect of which the importing country has already granted a license for field trials, need to be capable of being exported without expensive approval procedures. Dual notifications make little sense, as they result in more bureaucracy and far from greater safety for people and the environment. What we need is sensible and practical rules in order to make good use of biotechnology's chances in third countries while maintaining biodiversity. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, high-quality food is produced nowadays and it has to meet a wide range of requirements. An enormous variety of food is on offer, including food from widely varying countries outside the European Union. Our guiding principle should continue to be that our food should be safe and of a high quality, in order to ensure that consumers are protected. Food is the most basic prerequisite for people's health and quality of life. Nevertheless, past scandals have unsettled and frightened consumers enormously. For example, I find it irresponsible that dishonest pharmaceutical companies should dispose of hormone products through animal feed and food, turning consumers into walking rubbish bins. I find it absolutely horrifying that metroxyprogesteronacetate is present in sugar syrup and soft drinks! I would like to ask, Commissioner, what legal steps have now been taken to prevent this recurring in the future. I welcome the new European Food Safety Authority as an early warning system for Europe and as an efficient crisis management system coordinated between the Commission and the Member States. I am, however, concerned that the EU's controls should work properly. The network should be extended to provide better information and the reporting obligation for companies should be brought in as quickly as possible so that goods and products are withdrawn from the market if they are harmful. What has the Commission done in the meantime to implement this, and to ensure greater transparency and traceability? We need to protect consumers, and that applies to imports as well. That is why I believe it is a matter of urgent necessity to introduce control systems for food as quickly as possible in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe too, including those cases where food is already produced in accordance with European standards. However, to allow consumers to decide for themselves what they want, we need to ensure that we have practical and clear labelling both for conventionally produced food and for genetically modified food. I firmly believe that we need to set the course for this as soon as possible.

Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, your main argument for relaxing the feed ban is the cost of disposing of animal by-products. Now that is more of an economic argument or an environmental protection argument. To hear this argument from you, the Commissioner for consumer protection, comes to me as something of a shock. Should we not be setting the cost of disposing of animal by-products against what it will cost European farmers if there is a renewed outbreak of BSE in their herds or – worse still – if people start falling ill? If you could answer me that, I would be most grateful. I still take the view that we need a total feed ban on meat and bonemeal at least until we can determine how infectious the prions responsible for the outbreak of BSE are and until we can define different types of bonemeal for each type of animal. Only then will we be sure that the bonemeal in poultry feed, for example, does not come from poultry. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report Mrs Corbey has presented is a comprehensive and ambitious one, and I endorse most of its points. All the Member States need in future to work together, in an active and constructive way, on avoiding packaging waste and on systematically collecting and recycling it. The best possible systems are needed to deal with the approximately 58 million tonnes of packaging waste that the European Union produces every year. They will enable us to ensure better protection for the environment, and also, at the same time, to give important sectors of industry greater security in terms of planning. There are two amendments that I see as being of enormous importance when we come to the vote. The first has to do with ceramic containers, which have for decades been produced in many Member States, principally France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, but also in family-run businesses in the region from which I come. Ceramic bottles, ceramic pots, and ceramic bowls are nowadays used mainly for the packaging of foodstuffs, but also for the packaging of distilled liquors, chocolates, patés and so on, and they make up only 0.1% of the European Union's waste packaging, in other words, 60 000 tonnes out of a total 58 million tonnes. Such ceramic packaging consists of nothing but baked clay and does not, therefore, contain pollutants of any sort. The characteristics of the material make the recovery of the used ceramic containers pointless. They cannot be recovered thermally, nor can they be recycled. They are inert and pose no risk to the environment. Locating such small quantities separately, collecting them separately and transporting them for thousands of kilometres across the Member States, would make no sense in either environmental or economic terms. I therefore ask you to support Amendment No 68, which creates a derogation for small quantities as regards recovery targets. My second point has to do with the recognition given by the Directive to the latest processes for reprocessing plastics. If we are to amend this Directive, we should take the opportunity to also make the objectives set by law technically up to date. Amendment No 43 provides for the recovery of materials from plastics, facilitating the use of polluted waste plastics to produce plastics as good as new. This process makes perfect sense in both ecological and economic terms and has proved its technical worth on a large scale. In Germany, for example, it has already been used to recover raw materials from over 1.8 million tonnes of waste plastic. Technology of this sort has enormous potential, providing as it does another method for recovering synthetic materials in addition to the melting down of plastic packaging of genuinely high value and the merely thermal recovery of mixed plastics in waste incineration plants. That is why it should be incorporated into the Directive. Over and above this, the protection of consumers makes it necessary for packaging materials to be safe, for them to comply with the requirement that the hazards of waste be minimised, and for the manufacture of packaging to use the most up to date technology. I do not think much of the idea of developing environmental indicators for packaging. The Commission should, rather, be working towards definite criteria for the assessment of the impact packaging has on the environment. We need this Directive in order to establish a working system for managing packaging waste in all the Member States of the European Union. (Applause)

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele have submitted a detailed report which should clearly help to improve information and transparency and freedom of choice for European consumers. Priority is given to human and animal health. But the most important criterion must be that this framework legislation is practicable. More importantly, it must be in keeping with WTO rules and not hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe with excessive red tape. We need, first and foremost, a practicable regulation on the accidental and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs in products which are not genetically modified. The threshold value of 1% in the Commission proposal is reasonable and realistic and a useful guide for manufacturers and consumers. The threshold value is important if various forms of cultivation are to exist side by side because cross-pollination, for example, is technically impossible to preclude in nature. The second important point is that only products which are scientifically proven to contain GMOs should be labelled; it makes no sense to label ingredients extracted from genetically modified plants, such as oil, sugar or flavour enhancers, when there are no GMOs in the final product. Nor should we label meat, eggs or milk from animals fed with GM feed at any point, because this is misleading for consumers. I am in favour of product-based labelling and expressly opposed to process-based labelling because it is technically impossible to control. We should only label where we have proof and can therefore control labelling requirements.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sexual and reproductive health and rights are an area on which we need to tread softly softly at European level. We have to take account of the diverse cultures, religions and traditions united within the European Union and give priority to ethical considerations. The European Union does not in fact have any competence when it comes to legislating on abortion or health systems. That is the job of the Member States. The principle of subsidiarity must be brought to bear to its full extent in this sensitive area and must not be ignored. Reproductive health is also a matter for the Member States. The EU's job here is to draw up carefully thought-out guidelines and foster collaboration between the Member States. This report confines itself to other matters not mentioned in the title. Thus, to talk of emergency contraception is completely misleading. What this refers to is the morning-after pill and that is clearly not a form of prevention; it is quite simply an early abortion. Encouraging the demand for abortion and the morning-after pill as standard practice in the European Union and the accession countries without any formalities is unacceptable. The PPE-DE is also firmly against legalising abortion. Numerous European countries have already enshrined the unborn child's right to protection from the state in their constitutions. No one has the right of life or death over another person and any demands to the contrary run counter to the spirit of our humanistic culture. The report takes no account of what needs to be done in order to guarantee effective prevention. There is no mention whatsoever of mutual responsibility in a relationship or of the indispensable role of parents and family in sex education, two decisive factors in preventing unwanted pregnancies. This report sends out a misleading message, not just to the Member States of the EU, especially Ireland, but also to the accession countries. Like all of you, I have received numerous letters and telephone calls from worried organisations and individuals in candidate countries. People there suffered for a very long time under undemocratic regimes which arbitrarily controlled all areas of their life, even the most intimate. This is one reason this report not only worries, but incites anxiety and mistrust of the European Union in the central and eastern European countries. It makes fundamental demands on the governments of the accession countries, which are completely excluded from the decision-making process. That contradicts our understanding of the word democracy. The Charter of Fundamental Rights requires us to uphold human dignity and protect life. The principles of the European Union include subsidiarity and maintaining cultural diversity. And we should not forget that when we vote on this report tomorrow. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, the report Mr Nisticò has presented is an excellent one, the content of which I fully endorse. I do not want Mr Lund's statement to give a false impression. There is a need for this directive to achieve uniformity across the Member States in matters affecting the safety and quality of blood and blood plasma. Both in terms of infection and the maintenance of supplies, the protection of patients has the highest priority. Two things, therefore, must be safeguarded as a matter of fundamental principle: blood quality and the availability of sufficient blood and blood plasma in the European Union. I will go on record as supporting the Council's Common Position, which enhances the safety of blood and blood components and, at the same time, puts us on course to achieve maximum availability of lifesaving drugs. Plasma is needed in the manufacture of drugs which are essential to life, for example the clotting agents 7 and 8 for haemophiliacs and immunoglobulins to prevent infections in patients with congenital weaknesses of the immune system. Any bottleneck would put many patients' health at risk, something that we as politicians certainly cannot justify. Voluntary and unpaid blood donation is a basic principle and so let it remain. The payment of expenses to plasma donors in the EU cannot, however, be excluded for the future. Almost 50% of the human blood and blood plasma needed in the European Union has to be imported, mainly from the USA. The directive must not prohibit the import of plasma originating from paid donors either. The EMEA study published at the end of last week clearly shows those blood products from paid and unpaid donors are without doubt equally safe. There is therefore no reason to make unpaid donation mandatory on safety grounds, which would inevitably block supplies even of medicinal products manufactured from blood plasma. This makes Amendments Nos 7, 19 and 20 unacceptable.

 Thank you, Commissioner, for giving such comprehensive information. Mr Wuermeling and I are generally concerned about this as, in the border regions from which we come, the increase in the volume of traffic is not merely between 40% and 50%, but in excess of that figure. People living along the main roads in border areas have to cope with traffic jams, noise and gas emissions. When they travel to work, they constantly do so trailing behind HGVs from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. As a supplementary question, I would like to ask, as you have mentioned that railways are to receive special support, whether, in the meantime, measures have been taken or supported to transfer freight from road to rail in border regions, and whether you have had discussions about this with the German railways. That is my supplementary question.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schnellhardt has presented two expert and in-depth reports which clearly improve the Commission's proposals on food hygiene. In future, food producers and processors will have to document all steps in the production and processing chain. This obligation also extends to the feedstuffs used and the state of health of animals. This means that in future consumers in the EU will be able to trace food and food ingredients from the shop counter back to the producer. A transparent production chain will thus be guaranteed both for major companies and for SMEs. At this point I would like to make a particular point about SMEs in the meat processing business. In the European Union, there are around 150 000 small-scale butchery workshops with a total of over 1 million employees and an annual turnover of around EUR 60 billion. It is these small workshops that ensure local supplies and maintain a variety of products in rural areas. They use their special skills to produce local specialities and make an important contribution to Europe's delicatessens. The close contact between them and the consumer creates confidence in the quality and safety of their products. That is why we need to pay special attention to the needs of small businesses and to come up with suitable and practical legal arrangements for these companies, which offer people in Europe so many jobs and training opportunities. I have tabled an amendment jointly with the rapporteur which relates specially to single-place slaughter in butcher's workshops because in addition to rules governing slaughter lines in large slaughterhouses we also need to take account of the conditions that prevail in small-scale slaughter operations. If sufficient care and expertise is applied, single-place slaughter can be carried out in perfectly hygienic conditions. That is why I urge you to support Amendment No 133.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by means of the White Paper ‘A new impetus for European Youth’, the Commission has presented us with a comprehensive outline of the European Union's youth policy for the future. Although a step in the right direction, it is a concept capable of further development. During consultations with the Commission, European youth associations clearly expressed the view that this White Paper should give a higher profile to gender-specific issues. I incorporated this concern in my opinion for the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and put it forward emphatically. Equal opportunities and the gender issue do not only affect us adults – quite the opposite, in fact. It is precisely in schools and in youth work that choices are made about the self-evidently equal rights of girls and boys, of women and men. European youth policy, too, must attach great value to this. I welcome the report's proposals for greater participation by young people at every political level, for better provision of information of specific relevance to them, for the promotion of voluntary service by young people and for the highlighting of their interests in the Convention and in discussions on the constitution. However constructive the proposals may be, though, we must not lose sight of the principle of subsidiarity. Youth policy is primarily a task for the nations, regions and municipalities, but it is Europe that can create the framework for it. I take a very critical view of the open coordination that is proposed in connection with this, which, in the form proposed, comes across as incapable of definition and diminishing the role of Parliament. The family, too, is a focal point in life as it is really lived by Europe's young people, something of which the White Paper and the report take insufficient account. The family, too, is a youth policy, and must be protected and reinforced. I see the White Paper, taken as a whole, as having a good approach and as giving Europe's future youth policy some impetus, but we must take dialogue with the younger generation further and invest a great deal of commitment in pushing for what results from it to be implemented. Only then will this initial impetus become the forward-moving process that Europe's young people have every right to expect.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, about 20% of all Europeans regularly supplement their daily diets. In 1999, European consumers spent EUR 1 615 million on vitamins and minerals alone. Demand is rising constantly, because people’s living and eating habits have changed radically. Vitamins and minerals are involved in numerous biochemical processes in the human organism. It is crucial to people’s health and to their physical and mental capacity that they optimise their intake of these substances. I believe that the opportunity to enrich our daily food intake with additional vitamins and minerals is very valuable. When we speak here today of food supplements, we primarily mean vitamins and minerals that are marketed in the form of tablets, capsules and powders. The directive on food supplements is designed to harmonise the laws of the Member States. This will give manufacturers easier access to all markets, subjecting their production and marketing practices to a uniform set of conditions. The directive unequivocally assigns food supplements to the domain of foodstuffs. Food supplements are not medicinal products, nor can they serve as substitutes for medicinal products. Through their categorisation as foodstuffs, food supplements are subjected to all the provisions that apply to foodstuffs in the European Union, including the provisions of quality, hygiene and safety legislation. The consumer must be able to rely on the complete safety of all foodstuffs, particularly of substances such as vitamins and minerals, where stability levels sometimes differ between products. The new directive targets two specific areas: consumer safety and the completion of the single market in food supplements. The Council of Ministers has adopted Parliament’s key demands from the first reading. Parliament welcomes the fact that the Council took account of our position regarding the need to include more substances in the directive. The substances in question are already on the market but have not yet been evaluated by the competent scientific committee. These are to be included in the annex to the directive. In the common position, a period of 18 months has been set for the preparation and submission of a dossier. The Committee on the Environment has extended this 18-month period to 36 months in order to give small and medium-sized businesses in particular sufficient time to compile the relevant data on their products. The House now has two further amendments on the table – one for 24 and one for 30 months. I would personally argue for 30 months, because I believe that two and a half years should be enough time to prove the safety of a product that has been sold to consumers for years. I attach great importance to the principle that substances should be scientifically tested before they become the object of Community legislation. As far as doses, and hence optimum consumer care, are concerned, Parliament welcomes the system of maximum safe doses combined with the reference quantities per head of population. In other words, manufacturers’ dosage instructions must not be based on the limits of human tolerance. On the other hand, they need not be bound by the recommended daily allowances, which are normally set at very low levels. On this particular point, the directive manages to take account of both the wishes of consumers and the need to protect them. The common position has come up with a compromise here that I entirely support. For this reason we reject Amendment No 6 to Article 5 of the directive. With regard to product labelling, the directive provides for clear dosage recommendations. The substance of Amendment No 8 on greater transparency is already clearly covered by Articles 38 and 42 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of 28 February 2002 establishing the European Food Safety Authority. For this reason the PPE-DE Group also rejects this amendment outright. For all the reasons I have outlined, I can have no truck whatsoever with the proposal to reject the common position that is made in Amendment No 7. Finally, a few words on the campaign which all Members of Parliament have been forced to endure in the last few weeks and months; this is a campaign through which a single producer and dealer of vitamin products has been pursuing interests of a purely economic nature. (Applause)
 The company behind this campaign is engaging in image-making at the expense of the sick. It is breeding anxiety among consumers and exploiting their distress for its own ends. I sympathise with all those people who have been taken in by the scaremongering and utterly specious arguments that have emanated from the company concerned. It is clearly not the case that we seek to prohibit vitamin therapies by means of this directive on food supplements or that we are trying to curtail access to natural treatment methods. What the directive does prohibit, and rightly so, is any attempt to mislead consumers by making exaggerated claims about the curative or preventive powers of vitamins and minerals. This directive gives consumers in Europe the support of a legal framework that attaches great value to product safety and responsible labelling without restricting the range of products on shop and supermarket shelves. In short, it is a legal regime that combines free circulation of goods with a high level of protection. After talks with many organisations – industrial associations as well as consumer associations – I am more convinced than ever that this directive points in the right direction. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome the Commission’s initiative to introduce uniform European rules on the use of animal by-products. Optimum control and traceability of animal by-products are vital prerequisites of greater consumer safety. In particular, I support the amendment which was adopted in committee on the use of kitchen waste for animal feed. The feeding of untreated kitchen and restaurant waste has often been regarded in the past as a possible source of swine fever and foot and mouth disease. For this reason it is especially important that all such untreated catering waste which is transported into our countries should be eliminated. It undoubtedly makes sense to process catering waste in accordance with strict regulations, so that the entire operation can be supervised down to the smallest detail. Our declared aim in all of this must be maximum safety for consumers. Strict processing regulations, by which I specifically mean rules governing sterilisation and the destruction of potential pathogens, and firm European regulations on traceability and control are indispensable and reduce the risk of the spread of epizootic diseases such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever. Consistent checks by producers, but also by farmers, must supplement the system. The vital thing is that farmers and consumers must be able to rely on the safety of feed products. This requires a system for the conditional authorisation of catering waste for use as animal feed, a system that can be closely monitored. This is why I firmly support the amendment tabled by the Environment Committee.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report focuses principally on public health and food safety. Feeding with infective animal meals or fats is still regarded as the principal trigger for BSE. It is irresponsible, in view of the experience we had of poor adherence to the ban on feeding ruminants with animal meal, to think at present in terms of lifting the general EU-wide ban on it. Moreover, consumers would find it incomprehensible. All animal meals still kept in stock, as well as feed containing them, must be destroyed without delay in order to prevent future cross-contamination of feedingstuffs. There is a particular and connected danger presented by the animal meals, some of them infective, still stored in other states. The smallest amounts of this material is sufficient to cause infections, and this is yet another reason not to lift the ban on feeding with it. Guaranteeing the safety of humans and animals most certainly and fundamentally presupposes a working and stringent system of controls in the Member States. I welcome the strict prescription of effective tests for BSE in all the Member States, and also the demand that the age for testing be reduced to 24 months. The Commission must also intervene in favour of the introduction of the open declaration of all feed ingredients in all nation states. Even before the Central and Eastern European states accede to the EU, they need to set up working systems alongside our own to oversee the safety of food and feedingstuffs. There is an especially urgent need for slaughterhouses to be reorganised so that the immediate removal and disposal of hazardous materials in accordance with European directives may be guaranteed. Imported food must be every bit as safe as that produced in the European Union, and so tests for BSE must now be made obligatory in countries outside the EU. The safety of food, including that which is imported, is a fundamental requirement for consumers who want to eat healthily. We must make it our concern.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike Mr Titford, I am convinced that setting up an efficient and independent European Food Authority as an early warning system is something very much to be welcomed. It should act as a transparently functioning scientific reference point for the Commission, Parliament and the Member States, but it should also be open for producers and consumers. Advice, information and risk communications for consumers can help to increase our confidence in the food we eat. Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers who want to eat healthily and we must take responsibility for that here. The food scandals over the past few years have demonstrated that we need, in particular, consistent implementation of directives and on-the-spot controls on food and animal feed. If we are to achieve seamless traceability of production, it is essential to optimise the way we link the scientific facilities of this Authority with the control authorities in the Member States. This will ensure safety in the whole chain from producer to consumer. And imported food must be just as safe as food produced in the EU. This safety can be guaranteed by imposing strict controls on food imports at the EU's present external borders. In parallel to this, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe need to establish properly functioning systems for monitoring the safety of food and animal feed before accession. However, one important problem will not be solved by the regulation before us today, and that is the dividing line between food and medical products. We need to minimise the grey area between these two product categories, food and medical products, as far as possible. If we do not succeed in this, the result will be new demarcation problems and legal uncertainty. That is why it is a matter of urgent necessity for us to make sure that when legislation on medical products is reviewed, an unambiguous EU-wide definition of food and medical products is established, so that there is a clear dividing line, because we can only improve safety for the consumer if we establish a clear definition.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a year now, we in this Parliament have had the opportunity to get to grips with the ethical, social, economic and legal issues raised by human genetics. I want to thank Mr Fiori for his comprehensive report. We are currently in a situation of conflict between the breathtaking progress of modern medicine and the ethical foundations of our society. The decoding of the human genome, the discovery of the functions of the genes, new medical techniques and now stem cell therapy are opening up revolutionary new possibilities for curing quite specific diseases. But this means that our political responsibility is also growing. It is the task of politics to define clear boundaries and give a clear direction to values. We simply cannot allow scientific progress and the potential treatments that result to erode ethical boundaries. This week the firm ACT presented us with a fait accompli with the creation of a human embryo by nuclear transfer. Ethical boundaries have clearly been crossed. We therefore urgently need to send a clear signal from the European Parliament that human dignity must be protected from research that knows no boundaries and no taboos. We must, therefore, speak out clearly against reproductive and therapeutic cloning of human embryos, against any interventions in the human germ line and against the production of human embryos solely for research purposes. This ban must apply for both private and public research. When it comes to stem cell research, I am, in principle, against research that consumes embryos. I do, however, find the research into the 72 embryonic stem cell lines that were already in existence before 1 August 2001 acceptable in basic research. Instead of putting life at everyone’s disposal, special support must be given to alternative research using foetal and adult stem cells. Every human being has the right to uniqueness. As politicians, we must defend that right vehemently in future.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, chemical substances and products are a part of our daily life today. To a large extent, we could not manage in our society without them. For example, we use cleaning materials, cosmetics, plastics, medicines and much more besides, almost without thinking about it. It is though, equally self-evident that we must know what effects the use of these substances and products has on our health and our environment, and so we need a practical and flexible system to monitor and evaluate existing substances and those materials that may be created in the future. The Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats takes the view that the White Paper must do away with the inadequacy of European chemical policy and give first priority to protecting human beings and the environment, as well as to sustainable development, without thereby jeopardising the competitiveness of the chemical industry and of SME's in the global market. The chemical industry is the third largest processing industry in Europe, and, according to the Commission's figures, provides 4.7 million jobs in almost 40 000 firms, most of them small and medium-sized enterprises. With this report, we are deciding on their future. The Schörling report clearly focuses on the ecological dimension, and there are grounds for concern that the excessive demands, on the authorities as well, will paralyse the whole system and condemn it to failure from the outset. We in the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats therefore cannot go along with the obligatory registration of materials of which less than one tonne is produced per annum; the extension of the approval procedure; the substitution and prohibition of substances only on the grounds of their characteristics; an additional peer review process; impracticable duties of notification and databases. It is our opinion that only a balanced system can ensure the production of high-value products within the European Union, the safeguarding of jobs in it, and the improved protection of people and the environment.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nisticò has submitted an outstanding report whose content I fully support. It is essential that this directive creates uniform standards for the safety and quality of blood and plasma in the Member States. To this end, identical procedures for testing blood and plasma must be adopted which comply with the most recent techniques. Trained personnel should ensure the highest safety standards for donors and recipients alike. A transparent system of traceability and labelling will allow blood to be traced from donor to recipient and back. This also helps to minimise the risk of infection. Voluntary, non-remunerated donation is, and should remain, a basic principle. Unlike Mr Lund, I believe that there is certainly no direct link between non-remunerated and remunerated donation and safety/quality. The key issue is the selection of donors and testing by qualified personnel. However, reimbursement for plasma donors must not be ruled out in the European Union in future. Europe can only cover 50% of its plasma needs. The shortfall is made up from plasma from the US, for which the donors have received payment. The import of plasma from paid donors must not be prohibited by the new directive. This would inevitably lead to supply shortages, which would also affect the manufacture of medicines from these products. Plasma is required to produce vital medicines such as coagulation factor 8 and coagulation factor 7 for haemophiliacs, and immunoglobulins to prevent infection in patients with congenital immune deficiency. A shortage would put many patients’ health at risk. I would ask you to bear this in mind when voting.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking Mrs Klamt and Mrs Karamanou for producing such good reports. The sexual exploitation of children, child pornography and trafficking in human beings are appalling crimes which are assuming alarming proportions. Their proliferation is facilitated through globalisation and modern telecommunications technology. These problems can no longer be resolved through national measures. The European Union and its Member States must adopt a joint approach in cooperation with the third countries concerned. As regards the trafficking in human beings, a clear distinction must be made between two areas: sexual abuse, and the exploitation of labour. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, there are more slaves in the world than were trafficked from Africa in the previous centuries. The United Nations estimates that worldwide, around 200 million people are exploited as slaves. Trafficking in human beings is conducted via well-organised criminal and in some cases international networks. The Framework Decision is an important step towards better cooperation between Member States. The harmonisation of Member States' legal provisions will establish a basis for better cooperation between judicial authorities in order to enable Europe to combat this trade in human beings. The same applies to the Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. All the preventive options must be expanded further. In order to take effective action against these criminal networks, we need targeted training for the police and law enforcement officers. These problems must be considered in the accession negotiations with the Central and East European countries. With regard to the trafficking in human beings, for example, some accession countries have now become countries of origin, transit countries, and even target countries. On the European Union's borders, prostitution, sex tourism and the sexual exploitation of children have become a sad reality. Swift measures are therefore required in these countries to combat crime in these areas and strengthen cooperation with the EU.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Germany there is an old proverb which says that you have to suffer to be beautiful. With the new cosmetics directive, however, precisely the opposite is true: beauty, hygiene and well-being without risk. Three points are of particular importance to me: optimal consumer protection, a clear label and, as a general rule, the avoidance of animal testing. Optimal care must be combined with a maximum degree of consumer protection. We can only guarantee this optimal safety by having numerous scientific tests. Scientists are busily researching new test methods which deliver reliable research results and at the same time avoid the need for animals to suffer. It is our declared objective to bring to an end the era of animal testing. We need to support all scientific moves towards achieving this. In the future there must be no tests on animals for products and their constituents which have already been investigated once and for which reliable results are available. Nevertheless, consumer protection and product safety are our prime concern. That is why in exceptional cases, where there is no alternative, we need to allow animal testing until further notice, above all when the optimal protection of infants, children, the sick and older people is at stake, including with respect to shampoos and creams. That is why we have to permit the Member States to allow animal testing for cosmetics for two years longer than is currently laid down, provided that there is no alternative. In certain cases it is quite simply necessary to carry out tests on animals, in particular where acute skin and eye intolerances are concerned. It is also important for consumers to know which products can cause allergies. It would be detrimental to the market and discriminatory, however, to label all the cosmetic fragrances listed in Annex 2 for this reason. That is why the only products which should carry warnings are those which have also been previously identified as allergens by the Scientific Committee. It is very important for consumer safety that there should be a clear, visible indication of the maximum and minimum durability of the product after opening. The product label should also provide consumers with clear and easily understandable information about the correct way to administer the product. This is about consumer protection and safety with a minimum of animal testing while encouraging the use of alternative methods.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that PVC is a material with advantages and disadvantages. It is certainly wrong to confine ourselves solely to the problems of disposing of PVC. Instead, the entire lifecycle of PVC needs to be assessed from various points of view, namely the production of the raw material, its manufacture, use and processing, recycling and finally disposal. PVC is impressive above all because of the diversity of its applications and its long lifespan and thus has a wide variety of uses in particular in the building sector, as well as in many other sectors including medicine. The Commission Green Paper and Mr Sacconi's report put particular emphasis on additives, especially the cadmium and lead-based stabilisers. Industry already voluntarily refrains from using cadmium in PVC products today. The use of lead is also becoming less common. In certain product groups, for example, window frames, many firms are already using calcium-zinc compounds as a substitute for this stabiliser today. We should reward this willingness of industry to innovate and protect the environment by continuing to pursue and promote the system of voluntary commitments. Binding legislative measures should only be contemplated if industry falls well short of agreed targets to reduce heavy metals or increase the percentage of PVC which is recycled. A general ban on PVC products would be nothing short of fatal for 530,000 employees in the PVC sector throughout Europe, 170,000 in Germany alone. That is why it is particularly important for socio-economic factors to be taken into account when alternatives to PVC are developed. Against this background it would be irresponsible to call for a moratorium on PVC. Compulsory marking of PVC products would also lead to considerable distortions of competition. This would neither apply equally to all products nor would it deliver a noticeable environmental benefit. The introduction of a PVC levy, the separation of hard and soft PVC and a ban on PVC in the building sector would be a particular burden on small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe. In the European Union alone, 21,000 small and medium-sized companies are affected. PVC as a material needs to undergo a thorough assessment of its entire life-cycle. The problems and advantages need to be weighed up with a critical eye. As things currently stand, a general ban on PVC is neither possible nor sensible and should not therefore be advocated in this Green Paper.

I regret this very much because the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities was not involved in the early phases of the work on the report, either in committee or through the tabling of amendments.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about food supplements, we chiefly mean vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids and certain other substances. So we are not talking about enriched food, nor about food additives. We are talking about concentrated sources of nutrients supplied either individually or combined in the form of capsules, tablets, powder or similar presentations. Vitamins and minerals are involved in many biochemical processes in the human body. An optimal supply of these substances is vital for human health and performance. I regard it as being very positive that we can enrich our daily intake of food with vitamins and minerals. This directive on food supplements provides for the approximation of the laws of the Member States. Some Member States currently classify food supplements as food, and others as medicines. The directive clearly classifies them as food products, which creates a level playing field for manufacturers and also removes existing barriers to trade within the single market. At the same time, we are establishing legal certainty for European consumers. The Commission’s proposal is therefore basically to be welcomed. However, discussions in Parliament have made it clear that certain parts of the proposal need to be modified. I particularly wish to highlight the area of application. The Commission's proposal for a directive adopts a rather narrow approach as regards the substances it covers. This applies firstly to permitted minerals and their compounds. Some important minerals are not covered by the Commission proposal, despite their being used in many EU countries. These minerals should be accepted as a matter of principle. Of course chemical compounds still need to be submitted to scientific tests. This needs to be done before the directive enters into force, in order to avoid important food supplements having to be withdrawn from the market. In addition to vitamins and minerals, there are also other substances covered by the term "food supplements". But we should not overreach ourselves and try to regulate everything in one go as regards food supplements on the market. There is a consensus that other substances besides vitamins and minerals need to be subjected to scientific tests before they are covered by the directive. Nevertheless, defining these additional substances using the heading "physiological" brings with it new problems as regards classification as medicinal products or drugs, and would totally confuse the market situation, which is quite contrary to the aim of the directive. Blurring the dividing line between medicines and food supplements would lead to a lack of clarity as regards health-related claims, which have not so far been regulated. Surely none of this can be the objective of this directive on food supplements. As regards dosage and thus consumers' health, the system of safe maximum amounts is to be welcomed. Nevertheless, we also need to ensure that consumers do not run the risk of substantially exceeding the daily requirement of food supplements when they take a daily vitamin tablet. With vitamins A, D, and B6, for example, there would be a health risk. The Commission proposal clearly covers this. I totally support this. With regard to food supplement labelling, the proposal for a directive provides for clear consumer information. Labelling should tell consumers how to use vitamin and mineral products correctly. Products are required to meet the highest purity and quality standards. Both individual substances and the final product have to be produced in accordance with good manufacturing practice. A compulsory notification procedure is essential in order to guarantee minimum levels of official control. Above all, notification is only meaningful if a uniform procedure applies to all Member States. This directive will provide European consumers with a common legal framework which places great value on product safety and helpful labelling without limiting the range of products on the shelves. In other words, it provides a legal framework guaranteeing the free movement of goods whilst simultaneously ensuring a high level of protection. Finally, I would like to very warmly thank the shadow rapporteur for working with me in such a cooperative way. Many thanks, Mrs Corbey.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Olsson has presented an excellent report on the subject of the use of hormones in stockfarming. Food safety must take priority in all our decisions because consumers have a right to safe, risk-free food. Substances with a hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonists as growth promoters in beef production have long-term effects and may therefore have repercussions on human health. The main persons affected by hormone residues are high-risk groups such as pre-pubertal children and pregnant women. During the WTO dispute settlement procedure, the scientific committee came to the conclusion from its evaluation of the risks of the six hormones that oestradiol 17β clearly had a carcinogenic, tumour-initiating and genotoxic effect. If there is the slightest suspicion that an individual substance may have harmful effects, as is the case with oestradiol 17β, then we must react with a definitive ban. We are also duty bound to be cautious with the other hormones at issue if we are to have a high level of food safety and health protection. Compliance with the hormone ban must also be strictly controlled within the European Union. European consumers are also extremely sensitive when it comes to imported products, which is why the monitoring system for meat imports from third countries must be reviewed. Only if we apply the precautionary principle can we show consumers that we mean business when we talk of food safety in Europe. That is how Parliament can send out a clear signal and pave the way forward.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in general, the Commission’s proposal for a regulation on a voluntary labelling programme is to be welcomed, and Mrs McNally has produced an excellent report on it. Consumption labelling is, in my view, an important free-market instrument for promoting the use of energy-efficient equipment. The energy-star label should help to promote energy efficient standby equipment. The energy-saving potential of this equipment cannot be underestimated, and by introducing such a label the European Union will be providing the impetus needed to encourage people to use energy more sparingly. Saving energy goes hand in hand with reducing carbon dioxide emissions, as agreed under the Climate Protection Agreement. I think it is all the more likely to succeed if applied just about globally to office equipment. This would give us a joint labelling scheme, not only with the USA but also, indirectly, with Japan and some other countries. In this way, we would be taking account of the global market, which would help remove barriers to trade. The fields of telecommunications and information technology would seem to be particularly important in this respect. I think it is of the utmost importance for national experts on energy policy, as well as other interested parties, to be involved in setting up the European Union Energy Star Board, so that national interests can be properly represented. The Energy Star Board will be required to draw up a report on the market penetration of products bearing the Energy Star logo. Given the rapid pace of technological development in office and telecommunications equipment, I think yearly intervals would be appropriate. That is the only way to ensure that the label is only used to distinguish those products which consume markedly less energy than the average for all similar equipment on the market. Against this background, I urge you to support my opinion, which is appended to this report and which was adopted in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur, Mr Bowis has produced an excellent report, and in many areas I would like to reinforce what he has said. Establishing an efficient and independent European Food Safety Agency is very much to be welcomed, not least because of the various food scandals to date. Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers, because they want to eat healthily, and we have to ensure that this is possible. The Agency's central tasks will therefore be risk assessment and risk communication, an early warning system with the assistance of the five food committees all working together, excellent public relations work with consumers on food and food safety issues, and optimum networking with scientific institutions and control agencies in the Member States, so as to guarantee controls on the ground from producer to consumer. In order to rebuild and strengthen consumer confidence, food safety and regulations need to be taken into account in legislation governing fertilisers, plant health products, medicines, the environment and waste. Reliable risk assessment requires comprehensive analyses and reference measurements. To make scientific results comparable across Europe, the measurement techniques applied need to be standardised and harmonised. An appropriate infrastructure is required for testing food and in particular toxic substances in animal feed. The Joint Research Centre's Health and Consumer Protection Institute is currently also carrying out pan-European quality and safety checks on food, and is amongst other things testing food for contamination and carrying out reference measurements for agricultural products and foodstuffs. Substantial financial means are needed for all these measures. It is therefore advisable also to involve and take advantage of the European Union's existing institutions, and if appropriate extend them. The funding necessary for this needs to be made available by 2002. I have tabled an amendment on this subject, and I hope you will support it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Damião has drafted a very good report and taken good account in it of my opinion for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. It is most important to everyone to improve the health and safety protection at the workplace for women who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, both to protect the woman and to protect the unborn child. This is a general social issue and must be treated with the greatest care. The Commission’s report on the 1992 directive is only concerned with the technical transposition of the directive and does not look at the situation at the workplace, which has to some extent changed, or at the changed role of women in society. The number of single parents has risen and women are more concerned with achieving economic independence. The Commission must submit a proposal for revision of the directive that takes account of all these changes, and it must do so as quickly as possible, this very year. There is a considerable need to improve the legislation. That applies to preventive health protection measures at the workplace for the mother and for the unborn child. Here we must avoid any risks. Any activity that puts their health at risk should without exception be prohibited. Periods allowed for breastfeeding should be regulated and there should be facilities for breastfeeding at the workplace. Maternity leave after the birth of the child should be at least eight weeks. There must be clear rules on financial support, both for the period of pregnancy leave and for maternity leave. The question of reinstatement also needs to be clarified. None of these necessary provisions must lead to discrimination against women or to a reduction of their chances of access to the workplace.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a Bavarian delegate I would like to highlight a point in this draft directive which has a crucial bearing on my homeland Bavaria. It is undoubtedly right to make people aware of how damaging cigarettes are to health. The citizens of the EU are entitled to a high level of health protection, as enshrined in the Article on the internal market in the Treaty. However, the present draft fails to differentiate between cigarettes and other tobacco products such as pipe and fine cut tobacco, cigars, cigarillos, mouth and chewing tobacco, as well as the traditional European snuff.   In this connection, I would like to refer to the market shares of the various tobacco products. Cigarettes have a share of approximately 91%. Pipe tobacco, cigars and snuff account for 9%. These products are manufactured by small and medium-sized enterprises. Many types of tobacco reflect the cultural characteristics of the region where they are produced. For example, snuff is a crucial component of the Bavarian culture and way of life. For over 400 years, taking snuff has been the healthiest and most environmentally friendly way to enjoy tobacco. This is precisely what led to the Commission stating, in its explanatory statement in the draft directive, that scientists are no longer insisting on a strict health warning in the case of tobacco products not intended for smoking, snuff for example. Therefore, in comparison with all other tobacco products, snuff is the least harmful to health. This has been scientifically proven beyond doubt. That being the case, it is both unnecessary and factually wrong to apply a health warning, as provided for in current Amendments Nos 48 and 120. For this reason, I would urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 48 and 120 and to accept the original text of the Commission’s proposal as it is.

Mr President, it is certainly correct to say, Mr Verheugen, that the chapter has not been completed, but negotiations have started. However what I am interested in is this: Have transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services been applied for during these negotiations? You know, I am from a border region and I know exactly what the situation is on the ground. I am convinced that medium-sized companies and the craft industry will face huge problems and enormous challenges when it comes to the free movement of services, because there is a huge wage differential of 1:10 at present. You yourself know full well which industries are affected. Is there any intention on the European side to apply for transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services? The Czech Republic has already applied for transition periods for the acquisition of land by foreigners and this will have an impact on services. What is your position on the transition periods which the Czech Republic has applied for and what is the Commission’s position in general on this point?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I should like to thank Mrs Klamt for this comprehensive and thorough report. I am glad, too, that the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights has been incorporated into the report. Child sex tourism does not take place only in Europe, but throughout the world. Child sex tourism is a tragic and distressing fact of life and this problem has become worse and more serious in certain regions of the world over recent years. Parliament’s approach to the fight against this evil must therefore go beyond the borders of Europe. In addition to the situation in the Far East, there is also that on the German-Czech border, which is why this problem needs to be clarified in no uncertain terms during accession negotiations. It is important to clarify the legal situation and to dispense with the notion of dual criminality. The law of the offenders’ country of origin must be binding for the purposes of criminal prosecution. Offenders should not imagine themselves to be safe in some law-free zone. It must be possible to punish offenders, even if abuse is not a punishable offence in the country in which it is committed. This problem cannot be solved through national measures. We need a common approach in the European Union and in the Member States, in cooperation with the third countries in question. Children as persons with their own, inviolable rights deserve our special protection, irrespective of the country in which they live. This protection must be guaranteed in both theory and practice. Sufficient funds must be provided to support an effective, victim-orientated fight against this evil. In all the Member States of the European Union, the necessary legislative measures must be taken and the laws harmonised in order to guarantee the protection of children. Last but not least, protection of children as separate personalities with the right to freedom from physical and mental harm must be included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Mr President, we all know that disposing of waste in an environmentally friendly manner and utilising its energy by means of the latest technology is a requirement of our time and wholly appropriate. The directive on the incineration of waste contains important starting points for introducing compulsory high environmental standards throughout the European Union which have already been in place in some Member States for a number of years. And this is important and necessary. The aim of the directive is to establish emission levels which ensure harmless and environmentally friendly incineration of both dangerous and non-dangerous waste in incineration and coincineration plants without presenting any risk to human health. People are sensitised today and have fears of a high level of air pollution and the illnesses which can result and so the policy must also create completely clear framework conditions to limit the risk. Nevertheless, I must say that Mr Blokland is proposing some regulations and stringent conditions for the directive which go way beyond the objective. The operating conditions for incineration plants, as proposed in Amendment No 11, are neither appropriate to the objective nor practicable but, quite simply, superfluous. Science and practice have shown for some time now that such a measure does not prevent high emissions of hydrogen chlorides and dioxins. In practice, Amendment No 11 would also mean that many halogenated substances, for example PVC, which frequently occurs in mixed domestic waste, would be excluded from incineration in waste incineration plants. A further point is to ensure that the directive does not give rise to any protected markets. Industries which use coincineration plants in their production process have, for many years, successfully concerned themselves with achieving high air purity standards in incineration. Many companies are also dependent on the use of waste to retain competitiveness and jobs. Millions have already been spent on measures to reduce energy consumption. In my opinion, we should not disregard these efforts …. (The President cut the speaker off)

– Mr President, Commissioner, implementation of the flora-fauna-habitats directive is causing quite a stir in many regions and also running into major difficulties. Vaguely formulated application criteria are also the cause of the nine-year plus delay in implementation. In my home region, a dialogue was begun prior to identification of the FFH sites. The process brought the following problems to light in particular. Small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises are experiencing a restriction in the utilisation and cultivation of arable and grazing land as a result of the directive. This means indirectly a reduction in the value of this land. In municipal areas the directive in its current form is leading to the obstruction of important infrastructure measures. The threat of withholding Structural Funds in the event of non-implementation is an attempt by the Commission to put pressure on the Member States and is undoubtedly the wrong approach since stopping the payment of Structural Funds due to non-implementation also carries the risk that on-going projects may be jeopardised, thereby stopping or jeopardising the economic development of a region in general. Without any doubt, this cannot be in the interests of the Commission. It would be sensible to re-examine and revise Directive 9243 to provide more certainty and clarity. Citizens have the right to know the consequences which they can expect. Before notifying a site an owner must know which conservation objectives will be achieved using which measures. For this reason, I ask that you support the amendment which I have tabled jointly with Mr Schnellhardt.

 Mr President, increased levels of ozone and UV radiation have become risk factors throughout the world in which we live. I agree with the rapporteur that the effects of this are now clearly visible. Preserving the ozone layer is one of the main aims of our environment policy. We are all responsible for preventing damage to mankind and animals as well as to the entire ecosystem. That is why substances which destroy the ozone layer need to be replaced with alternative substances as quickly as possible. However, realistic transitional periods need to be set for switching to alternative substances. I wish to stress the word "realistic". Where it is clear that alternative substances are available which do the same job, the procedure needs to be carried out within the period prescribed. However, there are exceptions too and we also need to have a clear picture when we address these. In the chemical industry certain refrigeration equipment is indispensable for processes of chemical manufacturing. These refrigeration units are self-contained cooling systems and use a coolant for which no alternative is available at the present time. The size and complexity of self-contained cooling systems also make it necessary to grant an exemption. That is why I have tabled Amendment No 30 to the report, and I would ask for this to be taken into consideration. These cooling systems – I should like to point out once more – are self-contained systems and the coolant does not penetrate into the atmosphere.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the following comments to make on my report concerning discharge for the other institutions. As Mr Sjöstedt has already pointed out, the Council has indeed largely withdrawn from control and cooperation with Parliament, in contrast to the other institutions. We cannot accept this situation. It also cannot be justified on historical grounds or in terms of a 'gentlemen's agreement’. That is why we have called, in my report, for a response no later than 1 July 2004 to the outstanding questions contained in our questionnaire. The increases in remuneration resulting from the system of 'weightings' which the Members of the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors are granting to themselves must be condemned. Whereas the Commission was sensible enough, in this case at least, to vote in favour of suspending this illegal practice for its Members from 1 January 2003, the Court of Justice has reintroduced these increases in remuneration retrospectively on the basis of an internal administrative ruling. This cannot be regarded as a ruling in its judicial capacity, which means that these payments are still illegal. This gross violation of basic rule-of-law principles is especially regrettable when it is committed by the supreme guardian of European law, namely the European Court of Justice. The Court of Justice should set an example and be particularly scrupulous in the conduct of its internal affairs. The same applies to the provision whereby Members of the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors can use official cars for their private purposes to a quite excessive degree. However, as the Court of Justice and – in its wake – the Court of Auditors, unfortunately, have failed to come into line, we are calling for any transfer of funds to the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors to be suspended until these practices have ceased. Only under these circumstances can I genuinely uphold my recommendation that discharge be granted to these two institutions. Nor will I conceal the fact that once again, as has already been mentioned, problems have arisen with financial management and staffing at the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. However, I believe that both institutions have demonstrated to the committee that they are on the right track, and that to some extent, they are still trying to cope with longstanding problems. I believe, however, that discharge can be granted in these cases. I would like to make a positive comment about Mr Mulder's report concerning the agencies. We now have twelve agencies. That is a great many and as we all know, the number is likely to increase further in line with political objectives. However, I believe that as long as we are successful in avoiding duplication of work and setting appropriate priorities, the efficiency of these agencies will be guaranteed to a greater extent than is the case with the Commission, which is a mammoth bureaucracy. The heads of the eleven agencies are highly qualified and have demonstrated their responsibility for their particular agency. I would like to pay tribute to that. I really cannot say the same of the Members of the Commission, and the agencies make a refreshing change in this respect. After the Eurostat scandal, the dismissal of the Chief Accountant and the discovery of a completely inadequate accounting system deployed by this Commission to manage – or should I say mismanage – a budget of some EUR 100 billion, I will not be voting in favour of discharge for the Commission. Commissioner Fischler's comments a few moments ago about Eurostat also did not tell us anything we did not already know. I would like to find out from the Commissioner responsible why this Commission statement has just been delivered by the Agriculture Commissioner – have you concluded that Eurostat is an agricultural problem as well, or was there some other reason for this? I am sure you will be able to enlighten us. Combating fraud must of course continue to be a priority. Mr Bayona's report contains a number of points on this issue. In my view, the Commission should proceed very cautiously when amending the OLAF Regulation. In paragraph 90 of our esteemed colleague Mr Bayona's report, we have therefore clarified a number of points to ensure that OLAF can operate independently in future too, that it can focus on internal investigations, and that the rights of persons affected are protected.

 Thank you, Mr President; in 2002, EUR 1.8 billion went astray as a result of fraud and irregularities, which amounts, approximately, to an increase of a cool 36% over the previous year, and the greatest increases are to be found in the areas of own resources and structural policy. That may be interesting, but there is nothing new about it. It all adds up to a sorry story, Commissioner, and you cannot put a positive spin on it. It could be said that fraud is continuing regardless. A 36% rate of increase may well be desirable in other areas, but it is nothing more or less than a disaster in the anti-fraud field. It actually reveals that you have nothing to show for the four and a half years that you have served as a Commissioner. Let us remind ourselves how the Prodi Commission took office in the autumn of 1999 grandiosely committing itself to, and demanding, zero tolerance for fraud and irregularities. Everything was to be different after the fall of the Santer Commission – and what happened? One might say that one scandal gave way to another. Let me remind you of the way you froze out the chief accountant after she said that the whole reform was not going as smoothly as you had told the outside world it was. You changed the Financial Regulation, but without, in my view, making it more transparent or any clearer; instead, you did it by way of a jungle of regulations that nobody, at the end of the day, knows their way around. Indeed, your cardinal error, in my view, was to do away with the independent position of Financial Controller, and to replace it with an internal audit service, one that is neither independent nor – it would appear – very appealing, in view of the fact that you will, in April, be losing its director, who is also making good his escape. An accounting system has come to light that is described quite rightly in the press as being ‘as full of holes as a Swiss cheese’ and ‘as open as a bank vault’. Finally, we have the Eurostat affair, with its secret accounts and losses acknowledged as totalling at least EUR 8 million. I do not mean it as praise, Commissioner, when I call that a fantastic result; only a cynic could congratulate you on it. As always, though, you are unaware of any wrongdoing. All the Commissioners responsible are simply wriggling out of it and hiding themselves in the regulatory jungle that they themselves have created. That none of this encourages any confidence on the part of the European public is evidently a matter of no concern to you; it would appear that the prevalent attitude is still that one can be more free and easy with Europe’s money than with that of the Member States.

 Mr President, work on the Bösch report was obviously overshadowed by the Eurostat affair. In its efforts to shed light on the Eurostat affair – its secret bank accounts, mis-management and nepotism – the Committee on Budgetary Control also uncovered significant shortcomings within OLAF. In this case, OLAF’s main failing was to work too slowly. In so doing it missed the opportunity to recover a considerable proportion of the at least EUR 8 million that had been embezzled. I believe, however, that the report adequately reflects the various criticisms of OLAF’s work. One thing must surely be clear to all of us, and it is clear: the real guilty party in this more than dramatic case of fraud is not OLAF but the Commission. They hushed it up and issued denials for so long that they had no choice but to continue doing so. And the Commissioners responsible, including the President of the Commission, are still refusing to accept the political, as well as the actual, responsibility for this embezzlement. On top of this, the Commission tabled its report – this Article 15 report – more than one year late. That is not very respectful of the law either, Commissioner. In our view, Eurostat showed above all how necessary it is to have an anti-fraud office, if the Prodian zero tolerance of fraud is not to mutate into full tolerance of fraud. We want an independent OLAF and we continue to need a strong OLAF Supervisory Committee, made up of external experts. An independent OLAF is still far from being a reality, because unfortunately the Commission repeatedly manages to exert influence because of its links to OLAF in terms of organisation and staffing. The Commission’s attempt to take internal investigations away from OLAF, which only recently came to light, is a perfect example. Commissioner, that was not a rumour, as you have just claimed; a meeting really did take place. If your top officials did not inform you of it then I can give you sight of the minutes of that meeting. The Commission has an inexhaustible wealth of ideas in this respect, with which it now even appears to want to honour the OLAF Supervisory Committee. So far it has tended to be seen as a nuisance, but now, so we hear from the Commission, representatives of the Commission, Parliament and the Council are to be involved to make it more democratic. This would, however, only serve to undermine OLAF’s independence further and we will certainly not be accompanying you down this precarious route, Commissioner. OLAF’s work will also continue to be difficult. We are aware of this. That is why, alongside strong, unswayable managers, we also need clear framework conditions. There is still a long way to go before we have a European financial prosecution service, but I hope that there will be no turning back. I am not able to support most of the amendments tabled by the Liberals and Greens, with two exceptions, but we can go along with most of the PSE’s amendments and I would ask for your support for our ten amendments.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us consider the Eurostat affair. I am very disappointed by the measures announced by President Prodi, which indicate that the will to really tackle these problems is absent. Above all, I note the absence of changes in structure and personnel, for example changes to the responsibilities of the three Commissioners concerned. Let me just remind you how this House, right at the beginning of this Commission’s term of office, wanted to hold fast to the separation of the budget and budgetary control, precisely in order to avoid the conflicts of interest that face us now. I find no trace of any serious reprimand for the three Commissioners responsible, making it clear that they were in breach of their supervisory responsibilities and of their duty of care. That, Mr President, is something that every ordinary employee, in similar circumstances, has to guarantee in the course of his employment. Thirdly, the controls must be made much more effective, as Eurostat is, in my view, a shining example of how all the Commission’s checks and balances can fail. It would have been easy for you to take at least one or two of these three possible courses of action, but you have taken none of them. What this means, Mr Prodi, is that, for the second time since 25 September, you have failed to draw a line under the affair and regain the trust of Parliament and the public. There is one thing that I will not under any circumstances allow you to get away with, and that is your assertion that the reform of the Commission will be completed only in 2004 and that a Eurostat case will no longer be possible. Let me tell you that the opposite will be the case, as your reforms and the new Financial Regulation will weaken control still further. As a result of the abolition of the independent auditors, the Directors-General possess power to an unparalleled degree. Let me ask you this: is that really what you want? Democracy needs control, and an entity as deficient in democracy as the Commission certainly does. (Applause)

 Madam President, I cannot support the report as a matter of principle. The objective of the so-called open method of coordination is to have a legislative effect in various areas of policy, and there is no proper legal basis for this in the EU Treaty. This means that the Council and the Commission can create competences at the European level at will without having the legitimacy to do so. This does nothing for legal clarity or for legal truth, and it certainly does nothing to gain public acceptance. I also know, however, that coordination in various areas is already possible, definitely necessary and perfectly sensible. We can always learn from others. But turning this legal, voluntary coordination into a set of quasi-legislative instruments and conferring on it, moreover, the power to apply sanctions, makes European actions completely incomprehensible. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, of which I too am a member, knows exactly how sensitive and varied are the traditions in individual Member States; the fact that it is precisely this committee that is approving this presumptuous acquisition of competences by the back door, as it were, in an own-initiative report, is, I think, much to be regretted. We have always promoted a clear delimitation of competences for Europe and respect for competences in the nations and regions, which demand these things, and open coordination amounts to a slap in the face for them. Furthermore, I could not celebrate the involvement of Parliament in this method as a great achievement, because it would not actually change anything about it. Indeed, I believe it would make matters even worse, because it would give a veneer of democracy to this method, which in no way corresponds to the principles of the rule of law.

 Today, I have voted against the Czech Republic's application for accession to the European Union. It is my conviction that the most important foundation for the unification of the European peoples is the unconditional obligation on the part of all to the principles of a state ruled by law. It is on this basis alone that a united Europe has a future. It is this obligation that the Czech Republic is failing to discharge by retaining the decrees of the former Czechoslovak President Beneš, in particular the Immunity Act (Act No 115 of 8 May 1946), which to this day has not been repealed. The effect of this law is to accord general legitimacy to the gravest crimes and offences committed in the post-War era. There is no room in the common system of European law for any state that has such laws on its statute book. A decision in favour of accepting the Czech Republic as a Member State would also create a precedent that could be prayed in aid by potential future applicants. The creation of a precedent would do lasting and profound damage to the credibility of the European Union.

 I have today voted against the application by the Republic of Malta for accession to the European Union. The reason for my decision is Malta's persistence in shooting migratory birds. In the course of accession negotiations, Malta had flatly refused to fully implement the European Union's protection provisions in the form of the EU's bird protection directive, and managed to negotiate a transitional period permitting the Maltese to hunt birds up to the end of 2008. This arrangement is a license for poachers and for those engaged in the illegal trade in animals. European jurisprudence strictly prohibits hunting on the high sea, the hunting of songbirds with nets, and the mass shooting of rare songbirds. These are legal fundamentals that a candidate for accession must acknowledge.

Mr President, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which we all prize very highly – and rightly so – Article 41 enshrines a right to good administration. Now one might think it should be a matter of course here in Europe that each Member State has a fair and impartial administration which looks after the interests of its citizens. In the specific field of budgetary administration, virtues such as thrift, efficiency, probity and reliability are, of course, particularly desirable. The fact is, however, that, for the eighth time in succession, the European Court of Auditors has refused to issue a statement of assurance to the Commission attesting that the latter has managed European taxpayers’ money prudently and thriftily. The accounting deficiencies that a courageous woman, a senior official in the Commission, brought to light in the spring of 2002 are hair-raising, even to those with little knowledge of accountancy. For ten years the Commission had not conducted a cash audit. At Eurostat, the European Statistical Office, preferential treatment and mismanagement have evidently been the order of the day, with a devastating impact on the Community Budget. In spite of all this, the Commission sees no need to take decisive remedial action. On the contrary, officials who expose deficiencies rather than being prepared to conceal them are sidelined and hit with disciplinary proceedings. In this way – and I am addressing these words especially to the Commissioner – the Commission is not doing its job. If Parliament, as the supervisory authority, tolerates this, we too are failing in our duty. I am saying this so explicitly because I am a convinced European and because I want this Europe to have a future and to win the trust of the general public out there. When it comes to administering its own budget, I believe that the European Parliament must act in an exemplary manner. It just leaves a bit of a bad taste in the mouth when we in this House always discharge ourselves or our own Secretary-General. I really think it ought to be done by another institution. Let me turn now, however, to the details of the report on Parliament. The highlighted shortcomings have largely been familiar to us for a long time. Staffing decisions must be made more transparent, and the awarding of contracts must be beyond reproach. On behalf of my group I firmly support these demands that are made in the report. And it does seem to me that decisions on the purchase and construction of buildings, particularly in our Brussels base, are not always open to scrutiny. As for the discharge of the three agencies, we rightly express concern at the fact that their responsibilities can still overlap and that duplication of effort can still occur. The adaptation of their responsibilities to the requirements of an enlarged EU likewise remains unsatisfactory. The conclusion of consultancy contracts by private treaty by the body known as the Kosovo Agency, involving in one case a monthly fee in excess of EUR 25 000, was evidently the result of pressure from the Commission – a pernicious influence, in my opinion, which casts an alarming light on the Commission’s dealings with agencies in general. I wonder whether it is even necessary to have these agencies popping up like mushrooms all over Europe. Is there any reason why every single Member State should host at least one of these bodies? Can we afford these bodies, and do we need them at all? The Commission, I believe, uses them to fob off responsibility, but then interferes arbitrarily in their business in specific cases. This brings the work of the agencies into disrepute, and we in Parliament should therefore resolutely oppose any policy of externalisation, in other words the contracting out to other bodies of tasks incumbent upon the Commission, a policy touted by the Council and the Commission as the way ahead.

As in each of the past few years, I have voted against granting the Commission discharge for 2001. The Prodi Commission has once again failed to fulfil its obligation to manage the European taxpayers’ money prudently and thriftily. - For the eighth time in succession, the European Court of Auditors has refused to issue the Commission with a statement of assurance as to the reliability of its accounts. - The glaring accounting deficiencies in the Commission which first came to light in the spring of 2002 encourage fraud and carelessness. - For ten years the Commission did not conduct a single cash audit. - In Eurostat, the European Statistical Office, mismanagement and top-level conflicts of interest have been discovered, but no tangible action has been taken in response to these discoveries. A European Union with this sort of administration cannot fulfil the exacting requirements arising from enlargement and from the continuing process of integration.

 Mr President, I was pleased to hear that two days ago the Belgian authorities brought fraud charges against former Commissioner, Mrs Cresson, four years after her misdemeanours brought down the Santer Commission. This, too, shows the urgent need to create a European Public Prosecutor to bring to court solely and exclusively cases of fraud involving European money, and to do so soon after the offence was committed, because a preventive effect can only be expected if prosecution and conviction follow quickly. Although in principle I would be the last person to advocate a further transfer of powers to the EU, in this exceptional case it is justified because all – and I stress all – the bodies that have been responsible for the protection of European money up until now have failed lamentably, most of all the present Commission, which is being reduced by this task to throwing around verbal abuse. The need for action is greater than ever, however, because the amount of fraud, mismanagement and nepotism is growing. I need only mention the most recent goings on in the European Statistical Office, EUROSTAT. For the most part, national public prosecutors cannot cope. But hanging the small fry and letting the big fish get away is having a devastating effect on European citizens’ confidence in the European institutions. I therefore appeal to the Council and the Convention: we do not need any more green papers. What we need is a clear legal basis that clearly defines the task to be performed. Then there will be no more room for objections from individual Member States. This first step must be taken now with the revision of the treaties and eastwards enlargement. If we succeed, this institution will be linked inseparably to Mrs Theato’s efforts, and I expressly thank her here once again for her persistent efforts. (Applause)

 Commissioner, you call your communication ‘Modernisation of Accounting’. To put it politely, I call that a misrepresentation of the facts, as what has been revealed to us in the last few weeks has been total chaos. Your administration is about to blow up in spectacular fashion and if you had the courage of your convictions you would admit it. I only wonder why it is only now that you are admitting to this scandalous situation – I only mention the fact that nothing was obviously done to prevent multiple entries – even though the Court of Auditors has drawn attention to it repeatedly since 1994, why you apparently need a few more years, until 2005, to put a stop to them, why you dismissed a chief accountant who was the first to draw attention to these errors early this year and why you subjected her to disciplinary proceedings. I seriously wonder how you think you can sell us your new Financial Regulation as a great success when it is not based on an operational bookkeeping system.
Stauner (PPE-DE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, to follow on from the rapporteur’s closing words, both I and the PPE-DE Group are happy with the report and with the compromise which has been reached. I think that this report lays another important stone in the edifice of health protection for European workers, even if, unfortunately, it will still be far too long before we have common European protection standards. In this particular instance, the first proposal dates back to 1993. The noise directive was certainly no easy task, with the Council and Parliament taking up somewhat different positions. But the whole purpose of the conciliation procedure is to bring about agreement even so. Such agreement is, by its very nature, always a compromise but, as I said, we all have reason to be satisfied with this particular compromise. Objectively speaking, noise protection has been increased; the previous speaker explained the technical data and details. But what is important is that it is clear-cut; there are no grey areas or confusing discretionary powers when it comes to implementation. The employer’s obligation to provide hearing protectors, check they are effective and make sure people wear them is new. This sets out employers’ general duty of care without any room for misunderstanding. My group was also concerned that an allowance should be made for the music and entertainment industry when it comes to applying the directive. This is a welcome move for reasons of legal truth and legal clarity because it makes no sense to have to keep turning a blind eye to the fact that the directive applies to orchestra members in theory but is never applied in practice for reasons of comfort or on aesthetic grounds. It is therefore simply more honest to allow a transitional period here and let the individual Member States and social partners decide what they want to do themselves. I should just like to emphasise that, however pleasing it is on paper, this directive needs to be applied in practice. I am becoming more and more convinced that employee protection directives look very pretty on paper but that nobody actually wants to implement them. That may have something to do with economic developments, but it is precisely during hard times that we need to make sure that directives are implemented. I say that with one eye very firmly on the candidate countries because we must set a very clear example here too.
Stauner (PPE-DE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no disputing the fact that, along with the rules on free movement, health and safety at work is one of the European Union's spheres of activity that does not lack an unambiguous legal basis. The enactment of minimum requirements in this area is necessary in order to prevent, in this European internal market, competitive advantages from being won as it were on the backs of the workforce. In this sense, it is also laudable that the Commission is thinking about the future and setting out its primary areas of concern. As well stated in this report, women and people with disabilities should be the main areas of concern. I am, though, rather wary of efforts to interpret the law broadly and make every conceivable aspect of working life subject to European regulation. In this area, too, there must still be room for national peculiarities and independence. We are indeed facing great changes in working life in Europe. There are fewer and fewer employees in the traditional sense of the word. What are termed atypical working patterns are on the increase, and I also cannot rid myself of the suspicion that, in the absence of solutions to the real problems, we are increasingly churning out papers and declarations of intent that do workers at their actual workplaces precious little good. It seems to me to be a fact that – be it on the grounds of the oft-cited globalisation or of general developments in society – there is less protection for workers, the value of work as a factor of production is decreasing and the worker's need for protection is falling behind, whether despite European integration or because of it. Greater attention therefore needs to be given to the maintenance of the status quo as regards safety in actual workplaces. We have to maintain the level of protection that we have achieved and made into one of Europe's common assets; it must also be introduced in the candidate countries, not only on paper, but also in reality. Paper can hang around a long time, even, and indeed especially in Europe – we all know that. But the industrial safety that we have achieved is at the heart of the social dimension of a Europe that is becoming more integrated, something that I believe workers see as a far more positive development than papers on employment and other aspects of strategy.
Stauner (PPE-DE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what would a regulation such as the EU's Financial Regulation be without rules for its implementation? Obviously, it would be worthless or impracticable and incapable of being implemented, for, in the aftermath of our sustained work, in committee and in plenary, on a recasting of the Financial Regulation, here, hot on its heels, comes the regulation on the rules for implementation. Why do I lay such emphasis on this? I do so because I think we are giving another example of how legislation is evidently insufficient, but needs further elaboration. That does not help European law to be clear, simple or comprehensible. Perhaps, though, this wide-ranging creativity in legal matters does indeed contribute towards legal veracity, by which I mean the application of laws currently in force. It is with reference to this that I ask the Commissioner responsible for these matters to act in accordance with the law and not follow the example of the President of the present Commission, who simply describes current laws – such as the Stability Pact – as stupid and fails to apply them. The fact that the degree to which public has confidence in this Europe of ours is largely dependent on the Financial Regulation and on the rules for its implementation means that these are not in any way suited to being played about with in this way. Such confidence is damaged by the Commission's thoughtless and arrogant way of acting or failing to act; among other things, it has obviously neglected to ensure that its accounting system is reliable and proof against manipulation. This is a dereliction of duty dating back to the day it took office, despite repeated admonitions from, inter alia, the European Court of Auditors, and one for which it must be held accountable. That is also precisely why it is so important that the so-called accounting officer should be in a clearly defined and independent position. The Commission having, unfortunately, been so irresponsible as to abolish the independent financial controller, the accounting officer will acquire even greater importance. He must be able to get his hands on additional information with absolute independence, suspend payments, and criticise people in prominent positions, without being removed from office and subjected to disciplinary proceedings or something of that sort. I therefore ask you to support my group's Amendment No 33, and also the other two amendments tabled by Mr Blak, which are also intended to enhance the clarity and transparency of the law. We must not allow large margins of appreciation in budgetary law. Mr van Hulten, I am not surprised at your lack of support for Amendment No 33. The arguments you adduce here are the same as in committee, but their constant repetition does not render them any more effective. We must, in these matters, avoid the least suspicion of decisions being arbitrary or partisan, for only in this way can the Commission disabuse people of their impression that a more lenient standard is applied to the handling of European funds than applies to the handling of national funds. Incidentally, I greatly regret the fact that Parliament has needlessly allowed itself to be put under pressure of time in dealing with these rules. I do not know why we have not waited for the European Court of Auditors to give its opinion, but perhaps the rapporteur, in his great wisdom, will be able to give me an answer on that.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only does combating fraud seem to be becoming an ongoing task in the EU, but the Commission is also showing a great deal of imagination when it comes to the ways and means, and it is again showing its capacity for fantasy with this communication on the fraudproofing of legislation and contract management – a high-sounding title in very truth. It remains to be seen whether the draft, when it comes to fruition, will also contain what has been promised. I think it right to be sceptical about that. Since taking office, this Commission has distinguished itself by placatory promises, the words of which have not been followed up by actions. The Commission's announcement of its slogan ‘Zero Tolerance for Fraud and Irregularities’ has not prevented the officially-acknowledged fraud figures for 2000 from being higher than ever, and even those for 2001 from being, at EUR 1.25 billion, well above the average for previous years. Legislation and contracts are now to be drafted in such a way as to be fraudproof. It is as if they were meant to be stamped with the words ‘checked and found fraudproof’! Is that the big picture? Is it not self-evident that legal documents – insofar as such documents are at all able to do so – promote lawful rather than unlawful conduct when the EU's billions are handed out? Does the Commission not employ hosts of well-trained and highly-paid officials, and this objective not far from the least of those they are there to achieve? Actually, I do think, if we are really honest, that this communication is superfluous, promoting as it does something that goes without saying. I can only sum this up by saying that the Commission's clocks are obviously set differently after all. It is evidently necessary to lay down by means of an official communication that we must obey rather than disobey the law. I find that very worrying on the part of an institution that is the custodian of the European treaties. In view of that, should the Commission not at last deal with the cases of fraud that have come to light and draw the necessary conclusions? Is that not the method that promises success? To give one example, why does the Commission, with the resources at its disposal, not take a certain former lady Commissioner before the European Court of Justice? Providing a deterrent example for the future, that would be better targeted. But no, the Commission prefers to change the Financial Regulation in order to reduce transparency. It is still trying to limit Parliament's supervisory role, and it has done away with the independent financial controller. All these points are referred to in Mr Bösch's Report, which I also fully endorse in other respects. If fraud is to be successfully combated, then decisive intervention is indispensable. Anything else can be nothing more than an accompanying measure. Now I do not want to use this opportunity to enlarge on criticism of the Commission's book-keeping system, although there seems to be a certain amount wrong with it, but it is rather sad how the Commission continues to deal with criticism. It seems to have learned nothing from it. Mr Bösch mentioned it, and I want to repeat it. A Danish official is deprived of her brief and is marginalised for drawing attention to instances of maladministration, by which I mean what went on at Eurostat, to which our report makes reference. Despite this criticism – and despite what I am tempted to bluntly call adequate grounds for suspicion – the Commission continues to cooperate with a firm that operates in a highly questionable way, which has won contracts by deception and has failed to do any good work. This is something to which the Commission must respond. If it does not, it cannot be spared the criticism that communications such as this one are nothing more than diversionary manoeuvres!

I voted against the recommendation in the Dell'Alba report and, hence, against the new financial regulation. This new financial regulation no longer makes provision for any independent financial control before payments are disbursed from the EU budget. This is a violation of the EC Treaty, which requires independent financial control. With no such ex-ante control, the risks of irregularity and fraud will increase. The Commission has received warnings to this effect for a long time, most recently from its own accounting officer, who was promptly removed. The Commission will have to pay a heavy price for refusing to take these warnings seriously.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Rules of Procedure are the instruments which Parliament uses to regulate its work. They are, in a manner of speaking, the calling card that we present to the world outside. Being the only institution in the European Union to possess democratic legitimacy, Parliament is committed to the greatest possible transparency and clarity in the way it works, so that the citizens out there can also judge our working processes with an understanding of the thinking that underlies them. It is only through those processes being as clear and simple as possible that we will achieve the public acceptance of our work that we desire. A member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, in particular, sees any MEP's main right as being that of putting questions to the Commission and having them answered. This right, of vital significance for the control of budgets in particular, is enshrined in Article 197 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities and in Rule 44 of the Rules of Procedure. It is an expression of Parliamentary control over the administration and must not be restricted. Attempts have, though, been made in the past to limit this right, for example by the framework agreement of July 2000, which restricts every MEP's access to documents and items of information. It was not least for this reason that Parliament has decided to alter this framework agreement as soon as possible. I take this opportunity to remind the President of his task in this respect. I am very glad that the report before us makes clear, in a supplement on Rule 44, that the content of questions for written answer is the sole responsibility of the questioner. This excludes the possibility of their being examined beforehand by the President or by a body of any kind. In the past, this too was at least a matter of doubt.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted today against giving discharge to the Commission in respect of its management of the 2000 Budget. My decision to do so was determined by the following considerations: EUR 11.6 billion, that is 14% of the overall Budget, have not been paid out. I take that as a clear indicator of the Commission's mismanagement, and also as a trend, as the figures show an increase over 1999. The 20% of the resources that have not been used in a regular manner is equal to double the previous year's figures. The Court of Auditors has, for the seventh time in succession, refused to issue a statement of assurance. New charges in the so-called van Buitenen report have been known to the Commission since August 2000, but no work has been done on them, and they have not been laid before Parliament, thus blocking my report on the Leonardo programme. In the plenary debate yesterday, Mrs Schreyer, the Commissioner responsible, showed no capacity whatever for grasping the Commission's shortcomings, preferring to shift responsibility for any irregular outflow of resources onto the Member States, something with which we are abundantly familiar. The Treaty establishing the European Community, however, speaks of the clear responsibility of the Commission. Mr Kinnock, the Commissioner responsible for internal reform, does, admittedly talk a lot about reform, but, as the Court of Auditors has established, the reform process can as yet point to no measurable progress. The Commission under President Prodi is, for the first time, attesting on its sole responsibility to the management of the 2000 Budget. It can no longer pray in aid of the misdemeanours of its predecessors. I have therefore, as in the two preceding years, voted against the discharge resolution.
Stauner (PPE-DE

 Mr President, my group has abstained in today's vote on the discharge for the Parliamentary budget. This was essentially for the following reasons: we share with the drafters of the reports and of the amendments the view that clarity, transparency and regularity must prevail or be created, specifically when the position and responsibility of the groups in Parliament are at issue. We do believe, though, that this cannot be done within the scope of a single discharge resolution, but that it calls for in-depth discussion and negotiations. The same is true of the legal status of the assistants and the protection afforded them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Fatuzzo's report paints an unvarnished picture of the thoroughly problematic retirement provision situation in all the European Union's Member States, in particular of the problems that already exist, and will certainly get worse in the future, in financing the national systems for providing pensions and other benefits. It is quite beyond dispute that the EU needs to be active in this area as well as in others and to make its contribution to a possible solution of these problems, but it must do this within the framework of the legal bases in the Treaty establishing the European Community. Social security systems differ very widely from one EU Member State to another. More so than nearly all other legislative areas, they have grown from historic roots and have therefore evaded harmonisation of any kind at the European level. My criticism is directed at the method of so-called open coordination for pensions that the Council has introduced, a method that the Fatuzzo report welcomes. This procedure would lead to the European Union appropriating for itself, without any basis in the Treaties and, so to speak, cold-bloodedly, a legislative authority that belongs to nations. Council resolutions cause Member States to subject themselves to ever more restrictive and more detailed demands, the result being a quasi-legal obligation and liability. We have, indeed, already been able to observe this development in the area of policy on the labour market and employment. We are in favour of a clear demarcation of legislative competences between the EU and the Member States, that being the only way to guarantee the citizens of Europe comprehensibility and transparency, in short, legal clarity. In addition, the most fatal side effect of what is termed open coordination is that the only institution of the European Union to have any democratic legitimacy, namely Parliament, is completely sidelined. The Council has announced the extension of open coordination to other highly sensitive areas such as health provision and care for the elderly. It is therefore high time for Parliament to show the Council where the lines are drawn and take a position on this, above all in defence of its own interests. The CSU delegation within the European People's Party, because of its substantial misgivings about open coordination, will not be voting in favour of the Fatuzzo report. I would like to see wide-ranging discussion on this issue in Parliament in the future – with specific reference too to the legislative work of the Convention.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report Mr Blak has presented on discharge for the European Development Funds clearly shows the particular problems faced by European development policy. There are manifest problems originating in the Commission's system and in the way it works. Hence it cannot be acceptable that there should be, at the end of 2000, a sum of EUR 6 billion available and yet unused. It cannot be the case, in view of the increasing destitution in many ACP countries, that the Commission is unable to manage to get the funds made available to those who are in need of them. The Commission has made a start on changing the system in these areas. It has, since the Cotonou agreement, been going further down the road of giving aid in the form of sectoral budget support programmes. Put in simple terms, that means that the Commission has more faith in the recipient countries' responsibility. That is, in itself, a way of going about things that should be welcomed. The only thing is that this trust must, of necessity, be counterbalanced, in the event of misuse, by a consistent demand for the money to be returned. It is such consistency that is evidently lacking, as the Court of Auditors noted that, whilst the Commission carries out audits, and also spots abuses, not one cent of the EUR 14 million referred to by the Court of Auditors had been reclaimed or retrieved. Here, the Commission must summon up the courage to state the reasons for this. Either this is the fault of its own incompetent administration, or there are general political reasons for refraining from demanding the money back. I take the view that this will prove to be the scratch test for the new system of finance. If greater trust is placed in the recipient states, that presupposes that the recipients are fully answerable for any misuses. Everything else strikes me as inconsequential and as not in the long-term interests of the recipients. Here, the Commission must come to a definite decision and must not go down the road of least resistance, more comfortable though that would no doubt be. We are left with criticism of a few of this EDF process's anachronisms, with which we have long been acquainted and which ought to be done away with as quickly as possible. If Parliament is to give discharge, then it is Parliament to which budgetary and legislative power over the EDF's resources should be conceded. The Statement of Assurance, too, which is given by the Court of Auditors in its report on the EDF, must, like the Statement of Assurance on the General Budget, involve a complete audit and must not stop at the point where the funds leave the Commission level. Here, too, is the explanation of why there is a favourable Statement of Assurance relating to the EDF. The existence of two different Statements of Assurance is not only confusing, but also deceptive. I turn now to the discharge for Parliament's budget, where Parliament must be especially careful to avoid the least whiff of the suggestion that it might treat its own funds with less rigour than it treats those of others. I wish to expressly emphasise the demand in the chapter on personnel policy in Mr Virrankoski's report that the meagre representation of women in positions of leadership should at last be ended and that there be a serious attempt at an equal opportunities policy. Parliament's Secretary-General bears personal responsibility for this. Parliament must set an example if it does not want to lose its credibility. It is something more than sad that the Secretary-General has not seized these opportunities throughout the long years he has been in office. I also think that Parliament must play an exemplary role in creating an independent internal audit department, meaning that the auditors would not be subject to directions of any kind from the Directors-General and the Secretary-General. We also welcome the right to make reports directly to the President of Parliament. The report on the discharge of the Parliamentary Budget must neither cover up omissions and deficiencies, nor should it be misused in order to have internal problems dealt with elsewhere, which is what seems to be the objective of several amendments that have been reintroduced in the meantime. In particular, the Financial Regulation is not suited to solving problems within Parliament. These we have to sort out ourselves. Transparency, regularity and responsibility for one's colleagues are principles which, as Mr Blak said, are self-evident in the Parliamentary context. They are not suited to the settlement of party-political disputes, and there should not, therefore, be constant and self-tormenting calls for them. I will conclude by asking you to support my Amendment No 8 to Mr McCartin's report. It instructs the President of Parliament even now to defend Parliament's rights under Article 276 of the Treaty establishing the European Community before the European Court of Justice in the event of the Council again proceeding to restrict them.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, minimum health and safety standards are the core of European employee protection legislation. The harmful negative effects of noise exposure are scientifically documented and we do not need to discuss them in detail here. Noise-induced deafness is one of the most common occupational illnesses. Measures to protect workers from noise thus have a high priority. Everyone involved – workers, employers and legislators – should therefore seize every opportunity to keep noise pollution in the workplace as low as possible. With regard to reducing the noise levels which people voluntarily submit to during their leisure time, however, there is little we can do, other than appeal to the individual to exercise common sense. In agreeing protective measures for the workplace, however, we must also take account of the scope for their practical implementation – and especially the impact on small and medium-sized businesses. There is little point in adopting highly complex rules at European level if they cannot or will not be complied with in practice. In striking a balance, I believe that the amendments proposed by this House generally offer acceptable solutions. I would also like to thank the rapporteur particularly for her willingness to compromise, which was already evident in the committee. This defused a potential conflict over a significant change to exposure limit values and action limit values, without sacrificing the justified interests of employees. With regard to the assessment of the noise exposure level, too, the provisions of the Council's common position on individual hearing protection should be maintained. We also endorse Amendment No 8, which states that Member States may lay down values which are lower than the exposure limit values and the action limit values laid down in this directive where this is necessary with regard to the health and safety of workers. This is entirely in line with the principle of minimum standards in European social policy. We also make it clear that the employer is responsible for enforcing the wearing of hearing protectors 

and the provision of individual training. As ‘prevention is better than cure’, a worker whose noise exposure exceeds the lower
 

exposure action values 

will also be entitled to appropriate audiometric testing. 

The use of a weekly noise exposure level in place of the daily noise exposure level under certain conditions is sensible, as envisaged in the Council's common position. The aspect of this directive which triggered the most heated debate concerned the treatment of workers who are exposed to music, from classical/orchestral music to disco. In my view, we take adequate account of this special area in the compromise proposed in Amendment 23. I hope this is a solution which the Council can also endorse, for an immediate and unconditional inclusion of these events will hardly do justice to the general belief that music – whether in the concert hall or the night-club – is noise and should therefore be treated restrictively from the outset. (Applause)

Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur for this report, which concludes the budget discharge for 1999. Parliament is required to exercise its powers of scrutiny over the Commission's expenditure. However, this is only possible with access to all the documents and information. Otherwise, the discharge decision does not constitute genuine scrutiny but is merely a formality. I therefore draw your attention specifically to the demand set forth in paragraph 4 of the report, which states that Parliament must have the same access to Commission documents as the Court of Auditors has. The Commission must stop devising a wealth of new strategies and delaying tactics to withhold documents from us. The latest example is the van Buitenen report of 31 August 2001. I was the rapporteur on the first phase of the Leonardo programme in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, yet the Commission gave me absolutely no indication that fresh accusations of mismanagement had been raised and were being investigated by the Commission and OLAF. Indeed, if a third party had not drawn my attention to the situation at the very last minute, the Commission, despite its superior knowledge, would have allowed Parliament to grant discharge for Leonardo I. Since then, the Commission has played down the situation and deployed a variety of stalling tactics. I ask you, Mrs Schreyer, is this the trust and cooperation which you and your colleague Mr Kinnock never tire of demanding from this House? What have you got to hide? The entire report is apparently already in the hands of at least one German newspaper, together with the relevant OLAF report. Is not it time, Mrs Schreyer, for it to be made available to us as well? The Framework Agreement, which was cobbled together and presented to Parliament immediately after the 1998 general discharge without any opportunity for discussion, has shown itself to be ambiguous and misleading, and clearly conflicts with our Rules of Procedure. It is therefore unacceptable in its current form. The Agreement must be brought into line with the Rules of Procedure, not the other way round, which is what Mr Bourlanges' proposed amendment appears to be demanding. I therefore ask you to reject Mr Bourlanges' amendment and to leave Parliament's rights of scrutiny – set forth in the EU Treaty – intact. No committed European can genuinely be in favour of curtailing the rights of Parliament to benefit an already excessively powerful Commission, putting Europe at risk of becoming an uncontrolled and uncontrollable bureaucracy. This is the last thing our citizens want to see. As regards the disgraceful affair of the adulterated butter, known as the Flechard case, I would have preferred more plain speaking. However, I have no doubt that the spineless investigation into the Flechard case – which concerns not only wasted money but also the risk these products posed to health – is an issue which will give us plenty to talk about during the 2000 discharge procedure.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is scarcely credible that between 10% and 20% of people in the European Union are unable to understand printed matter and documents and make use of them. Even I will readily concede that I am not in a position to fill in my German tax return forms without expert help, let alone actually fill in an application form for a project promoted by Europe. It is, though, surely not this sort of documents to which this report refers. People who have difficulty with reading and writing are restricted in their ability to participate in the life of society, and, when it comes to earning a living, are relegated to work for which minimal qualifications are required and which is therefore badly paid. On economic, but above all on ethical and moral grounds, it is our duty to preserve people from this fate in this century of the information society and of lifelong learning. Parliament is therefore doing the right thing with this report by describing a problem which is often shamefacedly hushed up, and offering solutions to it. That has been done in this report as thoroughly as necessary and as briefly as possible, by the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange. European legislation, though, is limited in this task to measures of development and support, as general and vocational education falls within the remit of the Member States, and that is where it should stay. The Member States’ sole duty is to make real the right to education which is now also enshrined in Article 14 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The work of the monitoring centre which the report calls for should be carried on in the already-existing Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) in Thessaloniki, using the resources available there. That makes sense in view of the costs involved and of the relevance to the functions Cedefop performs in any case, and so I ask you to support our Amendment No 5. I would also subscribe to and support a European Year devoted to books and to reading, in view of our young people's widespread mania for television.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too congratulate you, Madam President, on your new position. I am glad that we are able to welcome another woman to the podium. I was looking forward to speaking on my report on the implementation of the first phase of the Community action programme Leonardo da Vinci, but I received this morning a piece of news which obliges me to go about this differently. According to this information, the veracity of which I have no reason to doubt, the Commission has since 31 August 2001 been in possession of a report which, and I quote, indicates ‘possible irregularities and possible professional wrongdoing within the Commission’ in the implementation of the first phase of Leonardo. According to this report, both OLAF, the anti-fraud office, and also the Commission are apparently either carrying out an investigation or have reopened the investigation that was carried out in 1999-2000. A representative of the Commission confirmed to me by telephone a couple of hours ago the existence of such a report on that subject. I could not contact OLAF's director and so have been unable to verify what that authority has been doing. As, then, there are obviously significant items of information indicating deficiencies in this programme over and above those already brought to light, my report has, one might say, ceased to have a procedural basis. On behalf of the PPE group, to which I belong, I therefore ask that today's debate and vote be cancelled and that the report be referred back to the competent committee, so that I can gather appropriate information and present a report containing all documents and items of information that there actually are on the subject. I would, though, like to ask the Commissioner present to enlighten this House as to why the Commission, despite my having had a meeting with a Commission representative only yesterday, did not inform me or the honourable Members of this House about this report. I beg to observe that the withholding of reports and items of information as significant as this does not honour the principle of trustful cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, and that I personally am very disappointed by this course of action.

Madam President, I do not want there to be any misunderstandings about this. Commissioner, I am obliged to you for your statement. I was certainly not aware that you had entrusted this Commission official with the task of producing a conclusive report by 31 August, but I then learned of this, not from the Commission, but from other sources. Do you, though, not think it a matter of trustful cooperation or proper administrative procedure that you should at least inform the rapporteur when a report completing the evaluation of a particular stage of an action programme is coming out? It is at Leonardo that new accusations are levelled in this report. I practically have to assume that you wanted to have your innocence certified by Parliament, and then, when perhaps in about another six months' time, it came out that yet more scandalous things had been going on, it would be easy for you to say: ‘Oh please, Parliament sanctioned what we did!’ Please stick to the rules of fair play. If there is to be a general report, I will not be able tell whether there is perhaps something about Leonardo I in it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to address the timetable issue, and do so from the same angle as did the previous speaker. I do not think, Commissioner, that you can in fact afford to wait until 2006. You cannot do so in view of the revelation of two billion euros' worth of fraud and irregularities, and in view of the challenges, some of them financial, with which eastward enlargement is going to face both you and us. I do think that speed really is of the essence here, and, indeed, you must not wait. You know that as well as we do, you know our report and you know about the proposals that have been made, which have stated that you are well able to tackle an initial, introductory stage without amending the Treaty establishing the European Community. Both the Council of Experts, which made proposals in 1999 towards reform of the Commission, and also the latest annual report of the committee overseeing OLAF have mapped out these two stages for you. In view of this pressure, which really is needed, I ask you: why do you still hesitate? Why are you again putting it off, until 2006? Why are you so hesitant, why do you not take the plunge, as we urged, most recently in the Bösch report?
Stauner (PPE-DE

 Madam President, I voted against the Commission proposal because the Commission is using the reform of its financial management, which I also believe to be urgently necessary, as a pretext to weaken the European Parliament’s powers of control. The EC Treaty provides that the Commission shall present the Parliament with all necessary information on request. The Commission is now seeking to make that right to information subject to provisos in the Financial Regulation. For example, in future, the Commission wants to check whether passing information to Parliament would be against the Union’s interests. That creates the absurd situation where the party under scrutiny, the Commission, decides what information to put before the one who is to scrutinise it, Parliament, and what not. That not only weakens Parliament, but it weakens the Commission itself. In future, it will have to listen to the criticism that it has learned nothing from the past and is continuing to escape effective control.
Stauner (PPE-DE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the Prodi Commission’s existing policy on fighting fraud can really only be described as hesitant and dilatory when it comes to the really crucial questions. And I have very little hope that this will change, especially in the matter of the European Financial Public Prosecutor. A Green Paper is all the Commission has planned for the remaining years of its term of office. Your much-vaunted Commission reform programme lacks the crucial safety net. Those who abuse their freedoms must be capable of being brought to account. Your first duty ought to have been to clear up the old cases and call those responsible to account. Instead, you are hiding behind a hesitant judiciary in Belgium and Luxembourg. To prevent this sad truth from becoming so evident, you are following a policy of concealing information from Parliament, which you now want to get expressly embodied in the Financial Regulation. You are claiming for yourself the right to decide whether informing Parliament about a procedure is in the European Union’s interest or not. I would like to have seen you when you were a member of the State Parliament in Berlin, Mrs Schreyer, if the Governing Mayor had told you it was not in the city’s interest to inform you about certain things. That is precisely how you are presuming to treat the European Parliament today and you clearly fail to appreciate that in so doing you weaken not only this Parliament but, ultimately, also the Commission of which you are part.
Stauner (PPE-DE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Rühle's report on the discharge for the European Development Funds presents an honest picture of the contradictions in our development policy. On the one hand, there are complaints that we are not willing enough to make generous development aid available, and, on the other hand, it is undeniable that the money actually made available is often only disbursed very slowly. There must be something wrong with a system under which at the end of 1999 resources of almost EUR 10 billion had been promised and made available without any specific deadlines, but had not been taken up. The Commission will, of course, say that since then there have been signs of improvement here and there. Nevertheless, it is a fact that we need to fundamentally review our approach. The aid we offer through the Development Funds is reaching its limits, because it is geared towards supporting states that in some cases only exist on paper. There is often a lack of an even semi-functioning public administration, there is a lack of democratic control of those in power, and many countries are in a state of open civil war or on the verge of it. In a civil war situation, we first need to concentrate aid on conflict resolution and on humanitarian aid. In other cases, we should concentrate our efforts to a greater extent than before on establishing properly functioning public administrations, which are a prerequisite for meaningfully applying aid from the EU or other donors in the international community. Such administrations are also a prerequisite for ensuring that countries use their own tax revenue responsibly and in the interests of their citizens. Our aid must therefore always be linked to reform programmes for public administration. If these reforms make progress, aid is given, but if they do not progress or if there are setbacks we should not be afraid to turn off the tap. I know that is a difficult thing to do, but it is precisely in such circumstances that the Commission needs to stand firm and adhere to its principles. Finally, I would like to say one more thing about this discharge procedure. The discharge had to be postponed because the Commission did not initially provide the necessary information. Furthermore, there was again the problem that certain confidential information was only forwarded to the committee chair and to the rapporteur. As I have often said before, and I shall say it again now, this leads to two classes of Member of the European Parliament – those with and those without access to information. The committee made it patently clear in its report that this situation should not be allowed to recur, and that the provisions of our Rules of Procedure in respect of the discharge procedure should be fully implemented in future. In other words, all Members of this House should have access to all confidential information.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the free movement of workers – a cornerstone of the Treaties of Rome, and the most important of the four fundamental freedoms in our internal market – can only operate effectively if the employment services also do not end at national borders. This is the role of EURES, a network which is intended to provide information, advice and employment services across national borders. We agree with all the key points contained in Mr Ribeiro e Castro's report. I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his competent work. In particular, we share his critical views – which he has just repeated during this debate – under Recital A, which sets out a clear set of conditions for the Commission as regards the provision of objective reasons and statistical information. This will also make our job easier. However, the report – like so many others – succumbs to a common temptation: it adds a lengthy list of new demands for future improvements to those already put forward by the Commission. In my view, the repetition of what is self-evident, and this House's often over-zealous efforts to list every conceivable demand, simply detract from the impact of a report and the credibility of our joint endeavours. I often have the impression that if the Commission puts forward five demands, for example, this House feels compelled to add at least another five. I cannot support this approach. What is important is not the number of demands we put forward in a specific case but their practical implementation. I think it is excessive, for example, to devise and implement permanent information systems, in particular within youth organisations, universities and the media, as demanded in Article 15 of the report. I think this is something which we can safely leave to the EURES units at local level, in line with the principle of subsidiarity. I also have great reservations about the creation of additional operational units, as set forth in Article 16, because they lack substance and are often used as a fig leaf in order to conceal the failures of existing bodies. The growing importance of EURES' role in the light of the forthcoming EU enlargement must be clearly underlined, as in this report. Sound career advice and employment services can undoubtedly help to channel potential widespread interest in migration. Nonetheless, the goal of further integration of the labour market within the Fifteen must not slip into the background. What is absolutely essential is the restructuring of EURES' finances and the reform of its legal basis, as demanded in Article 27. This is borne out by the problems at local level and the enquiries directed to us as parliamentarians. As the representation of citizens at local level, Parliament must be given a key role in this area.
Stauner (PPE-DE

 Mr President, for an organisation with an expenditure in excess of EUR 92 billion the Financial Regulation is almost the most important legal basis for ensuring careful use of European money and preventing abuse so far as possible. It is more necessary than ever to stress this aspect because the Commission itself informed us two weeks ago that the sum of money lost as a result of fraud and irregularities in the year 2000 amounts to an impressive EUR 2028 million. That really is nothing for Europe to be proud of! Remedial action is more than necessary. The only question is how the Commission proposes to rectify the situation. As part of its reform programme it wants to abolish the independent financial controller, the very institution that experience shows to have been the most successful in combating fraud – I only have to mention the Fléchard case. That is like the police ordering all guard dogs to be put down after the number of burglaries in a residential area has doubled. Parliament has argued for decentralised independent financial control, in fact it has voted for it several times, most recently on 4 April 2001 in the preliminary report for discharge for 1998. The financial controller is also anchored in the Treaty. An 
internal auditor is not a financial controller in new clothing but a dummy package that for my group at any rate is unacceptable. A necessary counterpart to independent financial control is the clear assignment of responsibility, of liability for deliberate contraventions or neglect of duty by officials such as is, incidentally, found in the national laws of all the Fifteen. It seems to me that the Commission’s reform efforts will in this instance result in financial responsibility being passed to and fro like in a marshalling yard until in the end nobody knows what track it is on. The Financial Regulation should make for clarity, transparency and comprehensibility in the implementation of the budget. That is the only way we shall get the citizens to accept it!

I voted against discharge for the following reasons: I welcome the explanation given to plenary by the Commissioner for budgets on the Fléchard case on 3 April 2001. However, this alone is not tantamount to a fresh start in the Commission’s policy on dealing with cases of fraud. There is no clear statement that the way in which the case was handled after January 1994 was illegal. Nor has there been any significant change in the Commission’s inadequate information policy vis-à-vis Parliament compared with the 1998 discharge. I find it unacceptable that the budgetary authority called for but, as the rapporteur details in annex 2 to his report, failed to receive 11 audit reports, including all the delegations’ audit reports. This inadequate Commission information policy is exacerbated by the framework agreement which only allows the rapporteur access to documents. I also feel that I must abide by the resolution passed by plenary in December 2000 on the so-called Morgan report to the effect that, in future, discharge must be postponed if the documents requested have not all been submitted by the Commission. According to the rapporteur’s own information, this applies here.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report winds up the 1998 discharge procedure. As this is the first discharge to which the Prodi Commission has been subjected, it has been full of suspense. The 1998 discharge decision was postponed in April 2000 and discharge was subsequently granted in July 2000, but all this leaves a lot to be desired. I would like to address just three particular matters of concern. In 1998, for the fifth consecutive time, the Court of Auditors declined to give a positive Statement of Assurance, or in other words to certify that European taxpayers' money had been used carefully and thriftily. Parliament therefore certainly did the right thing when it called on the Commission to arrive at a positive Statement of Assurance for the financial year 2003 at the latest. Unfortunately, the Commission has failed up to now to take concrete and measurable steps in this direction. It is not enough that the Commission has repeatedly referred to the general reform programme. I would therefore like to ask the Commission if careful use of European taxpayers' money should not be a priority theme for the Commission. Or does the Commission perhaps want to celebrate an anniversary in 2003 – ten years of being refused a positive Statement of Assurance? We judge the Commission not by its words, but by its deeds. That is why I specifically welcome the deadlines that we have set you for achieving this objective. The Fléchard case in particular has made it clear that the role of an independent Financial Controller is vital in determining whether a fraud case is admitted or not. You now want to scrap the independence of the Financial Controller and make him report to the relevant Director-General as part of the reform programme. There can be no doubt that this would lead to a spectacular fall in the error rate, but probably not because no more errors or frauds were being committed, but rather because the authorising Directors-General would ensure that such matters never came to light at all. The introduction of an independent disciplinary chamber able to carry out a fair and neutral disciplinary procedure, with the officials responsible being appropriately held to account, is also another long-standing request from Parliament that the Commission has failed to comply with. The Commission has equally failed to seriously pursue the creation of a European Public Prosecutor to prosecute cases of fraud. On the subject of access by Members of Parliament to information and documents, I would like to seriously ask the Commissioner how we are to carry out our verification duty if you refuse to let us have information and documentation? At the beginning of its period of office, the Commission espoused the cause of transparency and openness. I myself saw during the 1998 discharge procedure how wide the gap is between rhetoric and reality here. Nor was there any substantial improvement for the 1999 discharge procedure. You only have to look at Annexes I and II to the Blak report to see that the rapporteur received 22 of the audit reports he requested and, believe it or not, did not receive 11 reports. I think these figures speak for themselves. The framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament has dealt a fatal blow as regards this inadequate access to information. As you know, that agreement was approved here in the House in July 2000 without our having an opportunity to debate it. This framework agreement is driving a wedge between Members and is creating a two-tier Parliament. It is encouraging a policy of divide et impera –
 divide and rule. We can no more tolerate this than we can tolerate a lack of access to general documents. I would also like to remind you that last December we agreed, by adopting the Morgan report, that in future we would defer discharge if the Commission had not made available all the documents requested. We have actually found ourselves in that position sooner than many people expected. One more comment on the Fléchard case, and let me be clear about this: the Commission cannot in all honesty avoid making a clear admission that the procedure adopted at the time was wrong and that everything must be done to prevent such an unlawful decision ever being made again. Mrs Schreyer, as the Commissioner responsible you have an opportunity to make a statement to that effect. Please take that opportunity here today. I will make no bones about it: my decision whether or not to vote for discharge will depend on what you say today.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one and a half years after the Prodi Commission took office, we still remember its fine-sounding but pompous announcements about zero-tolerance towards fraud and corruption, together with the promises made by the retread Commissioner, Mr Kinnock, to make this Commission the best administration in the world. Unfortunately, even one and a half years on, there is still an alarming gap between the rhetoric and the reality of the Prodi Commission. In view of its failure to catch up on the backlog of old cases and to prevent new cases of fraud, I feel bound to ask the Commission why it is not seizing this opportunity to make a truly fresh start. Unfortunately, there is no sign of a new wind blowing through the Commission, apart from the hot air emanating from the tonnes of papers on reform generated by Commissioner Kinnock. And those reforms are already in danger of failing because of internal resistance from officials. Real problems in the fight against fraud and corruption, such as the overdue reform of the disciplinary procedure, are not being tackled. The Commission has high-handedly ignored all Parliament's suggestions in this field, and it is giving exactly the same treatment to Parliament's requests for a European Public Prosecutor's Office to be set up and for the independence of OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, to be guaranteed. Cover-ups, camouflage and deceit should not form the Commission's strategy for the fight against fraud. The Fléchard case, which dates back to the beginning of the 1990s, is an example of how not to do things. The arbitrary and unlawful decision made by the Delors cabinet in January 1994 ultimately led to a situation in which this company was able to play an important role in a fresh fraud scandal concerning traffic in adulterated butter between 1995 and 2000. It has not been possible to clarify or predict the extent and consequences of this scandal either in financial terms or as regards the significant risk to public health. In my view, the way it handles this case is the most important yardstick for the Commission's attempts to improve matters. I say that because this case in no longer just about the significant financial losses that the Community has suffered through fraud, but it is also about the health risk to the public both in Europe and beyond. So swift and consistent action is needed more than ever. The Commission cannot, as has so often happened, hide behind the need to protect companies' commercial interests. Instead, it should strike a balance between those commercial interests and the protection of public health. As in all democratic European States, budgetary control is one of the most important rights and duties of the Members of the European Parliament. So the Commission should not resort to artifice to obstruct that control. Those with nothing to hide have nothing to fear from such control. If on its own authority the Commission withholds documents classified as confidential, or gives them to some Members but not to others, that amounts to a blatant infringement of fundamental constitutional principles such as equal treatment and non-discrimination. The framework agreement of 5 July 2000, which was worked out with excessive haste, and which is supposed to legitimise such actions on the part of the Commission, needs to be measured against these democratic principles and is bound to fail that test. I would particularly like to thank Mr Bösch for his report and I look forward to continued fruitful cooperation across party lines in this highly important area. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are discussing the follow-up measures to the 1997 budgetary discharge at the beginning of the year 2001, is, to my mind, rather anachronistic in procedural terms, given that the 1998 discharge procedure was concluded more than six months ago and the parliamentary committee responsible is already working on the discharge for 1999. A modern, efficient administration should respond forthwith to Parliament’s criticism and recommendations for improvement, particularly when misdemeanours need to be dealt with. Turning now to matters of content, despite some welcome progress, the fact remains that key demands lodged by Parliament have not been fulfilled and are therefore to be carried over into the discharge procedure for subsequent years, which means that the clear delimitation we desire will become more blurred. There are two points in particular I would like to highlight. I am at a loss as to why the Commission has, as yet, failed to take steps to set up a chamber for budgetary discipline at the Court of Auditors or the Court of Justice, and so guarantee the effective application of the provisions of the Financial Regulation concerning the financial liability of officials for damage they cause. How many times do we have to ask, urge, beseech – and I do not know what else – the Commission to get round to doing something at long last? Surely this is a reasonable demand? The same goes for our demand that Parliament, as a discharge authority, should be given at least the same amount of access to the Commission as the Court of Auditors. After all, the duty to provide information is clearly Treaty-based, i.e. it derives from Article 276 of the Treaty of Rome. Incidentally, it also seems to me that the advisory office, which was mentioned earlier, would be surplus to requirements, and I do not intend to go into this matter any further at the present time since previous speakers have already taken care of it. However, both demands are reflected in our amendments and I consider them indisputable. I would appreciate your support in this.

 Mr President, when it comes to money, we all know it is no joke. The same applies to the European Union. That is why we and the other EU bodies agree that we must give priority to protecting the Community’s financial interests. However, we are of different minds on the question of how and by what means we can guarantee this protection. If we are to fight fraud efficiently, we must bring together all police, administrative and criminal law resources, for this is a matter of the European taxpayers' money and indeed of far more than that. It is a matter of trusting in the care taken by the European institutions, and above all of trusting the way the Commission handles the monies entrusted to it. Indeed we know this trust may be failing somewhat in view of the sum the Commission itself named in its 1999 report on fighting fraud, namely a loss of some EUR 850 million as a result of fraud and irregularities. So the Commission must carry out internal reforms so as to finally make good its announcement that fraud will no longer be tolerated and that it will consistently follow up all cases of fraud. OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, must operate alongside it. The report before us rightly devotes most space to that institution. The conclusion of the OLAF Supervisory Committee of 5 December makes it strikingly clear that OLAF is still far from being independent or functioning properly. It says that the obstacles the Commission sets in the way of recruiting OLAF staff can under certain circumstances constitute an irreversible risk to the fight against fraud. I expressly call on the Commission to refrain from any interference in OLAF's activities. Finally, I am in favour of appointing a European Public Prosecutor, so that those responsible for fraud face criminal prosecution.

 Mr President, this excellently crafted report shows that the Committee on Budgetary Control can take a coherent and convincing position on such a controversial issue as the importance of budgetary control procedures and bodies. Budgetary control will always be a tough and thankless business, because it is not a question of handing out compliments but rather of pointing out weaknesses, mistakes and omissions and thereby improving the way the Commission handles the European taxpayers' money. In colloquial terms, what this report is saying is that in future the Committee on Budgetary Control will be more watchful and will want to hear names named when it comes to the unknown whereabouts of European tax monies. Neither the Commission nor the Member States will be able to absolve themselves of responsibility, certainly not by passing the buck from one to the other. Point 21 of the report contains a very courageous decision in announcing that the discharge will be postponed if the Commission withholds information. I hope this obligation will actually be applied if it comes to the crunch. Had Parliament taken this decision sooner, it could not have given the 1998 discharge. For in fact, the Commission is still withholding information and has still not answered questions, especially with regard to the Fléchard affair. I also want to highlight point 20 of the report. It is a clear declaration of belief in the rights of each and every Member to request and obtain information from the Commission, including confidential documents. This declaration of belief in the rights of individual Members is particularly important because these are precisely the rights the Commission is calling in question. It does make us rather apprehensive, Commissioner, to find that the Commission as Guardian of the Treaties has to be referred explicitly to the need to observe MEPs' rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating the implementation of Council Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992, which is one of the most important directives in the field of the technical and health protection of workers. I well remember its genesis and the problems that were discussed at the time. A positive aspect is that at that time, irrespective of the dispute about the legal basis, its importance to women workers in the single market was recognised and a first step was taken towards establishing minimum standards for the protection of pregnant workers and new mothers. The Commission report before us continues to show up weaknesses in the implementation of the directive, which means we must increase our efforts to establish the protection of women during a special period of their life in law and in practice. Really it is very sad for a society to find we have to pay much greater attention to this area in particular. So I support the call to revise the directive as soon as possible. However, we will not manage it by the end of the year 2000. Some of the demands that will have to be incorporated in a proposal for a revision of the directive are set out in the draft amendments before us, and the PPE Group can therefore support at least some of them. First and foremost, they include the call for a strict prohibition on dismissal during pregnancy and maternity leave, safeguards to ensure that on expiry of their leave the women will be reinstated in their job or given a comparable one and effective penalties for those who infringe that prohibition. For women who want to or have to reconcile working life and motherhood, anything else would mean penalising or unjustifiably discriminating against them in their occupational and private life. Seen in these terms, the effective protection of pregnant workers and new mothers is one of the most important contributions to an active family policy. With a view to eastward enlargement and protection in those countries, let me also point out that the single market must not lead to discrimination against pregnant women and new mothers.

 On 6 June I as rapporteur recommended to the Committee on Budgetary Control that we give the Commission a discharge for the 1998 financial year. Today I voted against that discharge. The deciding factor was the way the Commissioner for budgets handled the Fléchard case. This firm was suspected of fraud as early as 1992. Nonetheless, it was let off a fine to the tune of EUR 14.6 million. Nonetheless the Commission continued to do business with it all those years, without asking any questions. Now the Italian financial police are investigating and it is said that the firm is involved in shady deals and the black marketeering of butter on a grand scale. Of course, we must not prejudge. But the Commissioner for budgets does not have the right to refuse to tell us how many millions the Commission has paid to this firm over the past years. Mrs Schreyer promised the figures to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 24 May, but has still not produced them. She gives one excuse after another. On Tuesday, she tried to make this House believe, wrongly, that Regulation 2390/1999 prevented her from presenting the figures. The Community budget is not a matter of secrecy. If the Commission refuses to render account, our response can only be to refuse the discharge.

 I voted against giving a discharge to the Secretary-General because he gave misleading information to the political decision-making bodies about the purchase of the ASP building in Brussels. This wrongly gave the impression that the Council and the Commission had agreed to the building being financed with the help of the then property developer. Furthermore, this wrongly gave the impression that financing the building with the help of the property developer was an indirect form of financing. In fact, in 1988 Parliament directly indebted itself to a banking consortium headed by WestLB, for amounts of ECU 472 million and BEF 7 billion, without first publishing an invitation to tender for the contract in the Official Journal. The Court of Auditors also found that the relevant financial regulations had been infringed.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 6 July, this House will decide whether to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the general budget for the 1998 financial year. As it is almost a year since the new Prodi Commission took up its duties, with the lofty promise of pursuing a policy of zero-tolerance towards fraud in dealings with the European tax-payer’s money, this budgetary discharge has special significance.   This is the new Commission’s first opportunity to show how seriously it is taking this fresh start. On 13 April, Parliament postponed the decision on granting discharge for the 1998 financial year, at the same time citing 17 conditions that the Commission was to fulfil by 15 May. These conditions corresponded in large measure to the demands contained in the report by the Court of Auditors, such as the commitment to ultimately arrive at a positive statement of assurance.  The Court of Auditors declined, for the fifth time in succession, to provide an assurance that the Commission’s handling of the finances for the 1998 financial year had been careful and economical. In addition, they demanded measures for dealing with the unfinished business of the three notorious fraud cases concerning Fléchard, ECHO and MED, and for issuing penalties in respect of them. The Commission was criticised for being slow to produce documents and information, and likewise, there was criticism of the lack of transparency and independence as regards disciplinary procedures. Since the Commission had at least fulfilled some of the conditions within the period stipulated, and the appointment of a new Secretary-General of the Commission had signalled a fresh start on the personnel front, I moved in my follow-up report that discharge be granted, or at least I recommended that the Commission recover the funds from the Fléchard and ECHO cases, which are estimated to total approximately 17 million ecus, for the EU’s coffers. Furthermore, the Fléchard case should be kept open since a new state of affairs came about at the end of May, due, in particular, to the stand taken by the Court of Auditors. On 27 June 2000, a majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control rejected the call for the money to be recovered. If the House fails to bring about a change of heart here – and I would urge the honourable members to give me their backing – then this money will be lost to EU coffers.   I believe these comments alone ought to be enough to inspire the Commission to take action on its own account to recoup the funds. What is more, it would be extremely easy in the Fléchard case, for this firm appears to still do good business with the Commission. The Commissioner for the Budget informed us on 15 June that up until 1996, a further three contracts were concluded with Fléchard. My more probing question as to how much the Fléchard firm received in Community subsidies for exports to third countries has failed so far to elicit a response from the Commissioner for the Budget.   I would therefore ask you once again, Madam Commissioner, whether it is true that the Fléchard firm received around FF 29 million for export reimbursements in 1996 alone, around FF 105 million in 1997, and FF 72 million in 1998? Why did you not provide us with this information earlier? Are you unwilling to cooperate or did your own colleagues leave you in the dark? I read in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung this morning that you wrote to Mr Schmidhuber, the former Commissioner for the Budget. I am certain you will be hearing from him shortly.   But Mrs Schreyer, I would very much like to have heard from you, rather than the press, as to when you are actually going to respond to my questions. When are you going to provide us with the figures that you promised more than a month ago to the Committee on Budgetary Control? Do you still stand by your statement that at the time, there were no grounds for involving the Fléchard firm, even though Commissioner Schmidhuber had raised the same question? Have you ever asked your fellow Commissioner Mr Lamy why none of Mr Schmidhuber’s representatives were invited to the meeting on 7 January 1994 in his office? I have also put this question to Mr Lamy in writing but have not received an answer.  Mrs Schreyer, I do not expect you to answer my questions any differently to the way in which you answer those put to you by Mrs Morgan, for example, who, as I have now seen, received detailed answers from you on 23 June, or do you perhaps apply different standards to the way you answer letters from delegates?   Stonewalling and appeasement do not, I feel, constitute a sound strategy. It is not just the European citizen that rightly asks cui bono? (
what is the good of this). 
We expect you to be consistent as regards the promised changes to the disciplinary procedures and the reorganisation of internal financial control. This must not lead to a de facto abolition of financial control on account of decentralisation.   It is recommended that the Commission be granted discharge for the 1998 financial year. However, as I see it, this discharge implies a weighty responsibility on the part of the Commission. I can only hope that you give Parliament’s new act of faith due recognition, and would urge you to do so.  (Applause)

Mr President, I would like to repudiate in the strongest possible terms, the accusation levelled at me by Mr Dell'Alba that I used my role as rapporteur for the discharge of the budget for the 1998 financial year for personal ends – I repeat, for personal ends – and his comment that as a German, I, or rather, we Germans, if I understood the translation correctly, would do well to put our own house in order. It went beyond personal insult and such verbal attacks are unworthy of our Parliament. I urge you to take suitable steps towards ensuring that Mr Dell'Alba avails himself of democratic manners like everyone else, even if – as I readily grant him – he obviously finds it difficult!

 Madam President, I would like to make some brief comments on the four amendments before us. My general view is that such a broad-based compromise, that has the support of the four largest groups in this House, should not be called into question again by amendments. However, assuming that the compromise – and I would once again like to express my sincere thanks to all those involved in achieving it – remains unchanged in other respects, I would ask you to vote for Amendment No 1 tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, because it includes a sensible addition. However, I must reject Amendments Nos 2 and 3, because in terms of content they would have too great an impact on the overall compromise. I also have to reject Amendment No 5. I think that it is legally unacceptable, because it sets aside the clear provisions of Rule 161 of our own Rules of Procedure. The amendment is essentially about a vote on the explanatory statement in my report. As far as I know this would set a precedent which every Member of this House would be justified in referring to in future. The President has accepted Amendment No 5, and out of respect for the authority of her position, I accept this decision.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barón Crespo, I have not specifically reiterated this point, but I am sure you will realise that when I was drafting both the resolution and the text of the explanatory statement I was very acutely aware that they needed to be in accord with each other, and I have really searched my soul about this over the last few weeks. I did not think it was necessary to say this again explicitly, but if you wish I will gladly do that. I like to think that I am sufficiently conscientious and intellectually able for you to assume that I would have considered this long and hard, and that I am happy to take responsibility for this and to face all the consequences that you seem to be threatening me with.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, “zero 
tolerance towards fraud and other forms of incorrect conduct is a precondition for regaining confidence in the European civil service”. These are the words of Mr Kinnock, the vice-president of the Commission in charge of reform, in the Commission’s consultation paper dated 18 January 2000. It was on this premise and with the noble claim that it would not repeat past mistakes – the last Commission having been brought down just under a year ago as the result of fraud and irregularities – that the Prodi Commission took office in September. The Commission must be measured against this claim and its self-evident obligation, as guardian of the Treaties vis-à-vis third parties, to guarantee that their application begins at home. It was against this yardstick that the Committee on Budgetary Control came to the conclusion, as the leading committee, that it would recommend that discharge be postponed until 15 May 2000 and would call on the Commission to adopt 17 measures. These measures relate mainly to four areas which still require clarification or the oft-quoted fresh start. Firstly, the error rate of over five per cent calculated by the Court of Auditors over several years must be cut considerably by 2001 and a positive declaration of assurance must be achieved by 2003. Secondly, the particularly blatant cases of fraud and irregularity in connection with the Fléchard case, ECHO, MED and contracts awarded to visiting scientists must be fully clarified and dealt with in disciplinary terms. Thirdly, Parliament must be given unrestricted access to information and documents for its control activities, as called for in the 1997 discharge resolution. Fourthly: reports must be filed on the relevant disciplinary hearings and fundamental reforms implemented. The Committee did not pass this resolution lightly and finally adopted the proposal submitted by a large majority of 19 votes to 1. The fact that this motion was tabled in the form of a compromise between the four main groups demonstrates clearly that Parliament is pulling in the same direction on this extremely important issue and wishes to signal its unity over and above party political divisions and any national interests or chauvinism. The Commission should agree to it if it wishes to retain its credibility in its handling of the taxes paid by European citizens and its democratic dealings with the elected representatives of the people of Europe. I feel particularly strongly about the integrity and the ability of the European executive to act, especially in view of the imminent enlargement of the EU, because the Commission needs to have its hands free for political policy-making and must not be hampered by time-consuming and irritating justification campaigns. Parliament takes the control function assigned to it in the European Treaties seriously. All the cases of fraud and irregularity addressed in the resolution relate directly to the 1998 financial year, even though some originated much earlier. All the measures called for must be carried out by the deadline set. All the cases are awaiting a decision. Clearly, the new Commission cannot be held directly responsible for the cases I have referred to, even if not all the members of the Commission are new. But it is responsible for dealing with this legacy and it will only distinguish itself positively from its predecessors if it takes a ruthless approach and clears up every last one of these cases. The Commission should also take a close look at how it treats officials who deserve the highest respect for their courageous sense of civic duty in dealing with irregularities. Despite countless lofty announcements, there is as yet no real evidence of a fresh start. Commissioner’s Kinnock’s reform paper, which is broad in scope if nothing else, sets off every single alarm bell in the area of financial control. Decentralisation must not result in the total de facto 
abolition of internal financial control. On the contrary, care must be taken to ensure that reforms concentrate on basics and that the principle of quality before quantity still applies. My conclusion is this: “Words enough have been exchanged, let me at last see some action. While you fashion compliments, something useful may happen.” You see, good old Goethe had the right words even in this situation. In this sense, I see the motion for a resolution as a chance for the Commission to justify the trust which Parliament demonstrated in it and its President when I was nominated last September and which it reiterated in its discharge for the 1997 budgetary year. The motion should also send out nothing more and nothing less than a clear signal of Parliament’s support to the President of the Commission, who unfortunately is not with us here today. I should like to call on the President to grab this chance and to make use, where necessary, of the powers to issue directives granted to him.

 I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives, INTERREG III. It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III. In the light of the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions – I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration – this is not only reasonable but imperative. The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect. In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects. I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures, especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment. Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B, especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy. In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis – because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level – so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing. The fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III is – in my opinion – still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise, although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the Commission’s support programmes. However, I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal. It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves.

 Mr President, it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union, more so these days than there used to be. The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe’s citizens. The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future. This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law. The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this. Now it is, of course, possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity. There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level. When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage. Now that is not a contradiction, since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law, as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU’s own interests, which, as far as that goes, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary, it protects them, at least indirectly. The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned. Taking these aspects into account, I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind, as proposed, and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF.

 Mr President, Parliament now has to reach a decision, in plenary sitting, on whether to grant the Commission the discharge for the 1997 financial year that was refused on 4 May last year. Therefore we must ask what has changed, against a background that is truly historic as far as the EU is concerned. What improvements have there been? What is there to justify granting the discharge today? First of all there is – to some extent in any event – a new Commission. There has been a plethora of declarations of intent and announcements to do with reform, none of which have a great deal of substance to them. So far, no consideration has been given to creating codes of conduct for Members of the Commission and their cabinets. I have taken note of what Mrs Schreyer had to say this morning on the complaint against the two banks and the support for creating protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the EU. These are also positive signs. Nevertheless, it has to be said that these will cost the Commission relatively little. The Commission has announced that it will present its reform programme in February 2000. Announcements and declarations of intent are one thing, fulfilling promises quite another. However, the Commission’s endeavours can only be measured in terms of actual results, for only in this way will it be possible to restore the enormous loss of confidence that the EU has suffered amongst the citizens of Europe, on account of various shortcomings and machinations. We have been able to take stock since May 1999 and our conclusions offer no compelling reasons whatsoever for forming a decision on the granting of discharge. If, nevertheless, discharge is granted to the Commission for the 1997 financial year, this then will mean that we will – once again – be giving them a major vote of confidence. It is another story as to whether our citizens will have any sympathy at all for a renewed vote of confidence of this kind on the part of the democratically-elected monitoring institution that is Parliament, in view of the grave errors committed by the previous Commission which are, of course, a millstone around the new Commission’s neck. In addition, and after all this is important as far as the general impression held by the people is concerned, there is the fact that so far – at least as far as I know – the Court of Auditors has been unable to deliver a positive statement of assurance since this instrument was introduced. Nevertheless, I would advocate granting discharge for 1997 and also call upon my fellow MEPs to decide in favour, for, in so doing, we would be setting down a clear marker for a fresh start, as well as giving the present Commission the opportunity to make a fresh start – which would also be apparent to the outside world – in terms of coping with its admittedly onerous legacy. Furthermore, this would entail continuing to track down and resolve once and for all any irregularities or incidences of fraud. If the Commission is now to be granted discharge for 1997, then under no circumstances should this be interpreted to mean a clean bill of health for the past or carte blanche 
for poor financial management in the future, for it is known that friendship does not extend to money matters. This expression also holds true for the relationship between citizens and European institutions. And friendship, which means confidence in the reliability of the work of the European institutions in this context, is something we have more need of today than ever before. It is, above all, the forthcoming enlargement of the EU to include the states of Central and Eastern Europe that will produce far-reaching problems and impose burdens on internal structures and administrative developments. A Commission shaken by financial scandals could very quickly become the pawn of certain interests and objectives that most definitely do not feature in the Treaty of Amsterdam’s catalogue of aims. Unfortunately, in the past, particularly in the year under review, problems have tended to arise in those assisted areas which are set to accrue greater importance when enlargement takes place; for example the structural funds and the deployment of Technical Assistance Offices. We must put a stop to this unacceptable situation with all haste, for we cannot ask something of the new Member States that we cannot deliver ourselves; nor does it help matters when the Commission and Member States point the finger at each other in turn and pass the buck from one to another. As rapporteur for the 1998 Budget, I would like to give advance warning that, in the course of the next few weeks and months, I intend to keep a very close eye on how and whether the Commission implements its reform proposals and how it shapes relations with Parliament in this very area.   (Applause)

Mr President, as the authority of the European Union increases, so too does the importance of the European Court of Auditors, which has been an independent body of the Community since the Maastricht Treaty. However, the quality of a body or an institution stands or falls with the people who bear the responsibility in it, which is why it is particularly important that candidates with the right specialist skills who are strong and independent of character be elected as members of the Court of Auditors. Because the task of the Court of Auditors is not always a pleasant one. The members of the Court of Auditors must monitor careful spending of European funds and be ruthless in pointing out irregularities. As far as spending by the European institutions is concerned, the confidence of the citizens of Europe has gradually been shaken in the past. It is, above all, thanks to the Court of Auditors that shortcomings have been uncovered. Now, however, we need to restore the confidence of the citizens of Europe in careful spending by the EU. The work of the Court of Auditors and its members will therefore be even more important and difficult over the coming years than ever before. All the challenges – enlargement, international competitiveness, sustained high unemployment – are linked to the question of funding and the remit of the Court of Auditors could change as a result. I think that its preventative work will increase. In my view, the eight members who were interviewed long and hard in the Committee on Budgetary Control have the qualities needed to carry out this work to the satisfaction of all concerned. I hope that you have the courage and strength to touch unerringly on sore points in the future, should it prove necessary. A strong Europe also needs a strong Court of Auditors. However, I make no bones about the fact that the Court of Auditors is weakened because the proportion of women is not high enough, let alone representative. This is a considerable fly in the ointment of the composition of the Court, even though the present candidates include a very impressive lady. The appeal to the Member States to propose women for this job therefore stands. It must have got out even in Europe that women too can count and they certainly have no problem in pointing out shortcomings!
President.  
 I apologise to our colleague for the level of noise before the vote. (The sitting was suspended and was resumed at 3 p.m.)

President.  
 Thank you, Commissioner Patten; we wish you a good journey to Moscow.
President.  
 My Lord, I came close to joining in the applause, which I am not permitted to do. Many thanks for this very personal farewell to this House; perhaps you will come back after all.
President. –  
The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
President.

President.  
 Ladies and gentlemen, I must now make the following point with regard to the agenda. The Commission's statement on Croatia is due to start at 6 p.m. I propose that I call the two speakers at the top of the list as well – which means that we will overrun slightly – in the hope, and with the request, that these Members will be brief so that we can then proceed according to the agenda and deal with Croatia. The timetabling has been extremely tight recently and we are having to improvise a great deal. I would ask for the indulgence of the three Commissioners who are now present so that we can overrun slightly and take the two speakers on the list. Then we will pause for Croatia.
President. –  
The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
President.  
 Before we discuss the two Commissioners' statements on Croatia in line with the agenda, I have a motion from President Pat Cox to read out. He pointed out on Monday that the inclusion of additional items on Wednesday's agenda could have an impact on the time available for Question Time. Parliament has now included additional items, namely statements on the situation in the Middle East and a debate about the vote of non-confidence, on the agenda. Under these circumstances, and having spoken with the Council, I propose that in agreement with the groups, we cancel tomorrow's Question Time with questions to the Council. In other words, the agenda would now continue with the debate about Croatia. Question Time with questions to the Commission would then take place at 6.30 p.m. (Parliament voted to cancel Wednesday's Question Time with questions to the Council.)
President. 
 – It is my great pleasure, on behalf of the House, to welcome the diplomatic delegation from Croatia, headed by the Croatian Foreign Minister, which is seated in the public gallery. (Applause)
President. 
 – The next item is the European Commission's Opinion on the application of Croatia for membership of the European Union.
President.  
 Many thanks, Commissioner Verheugen, for providing such a precise analysis for the benefit of the delegation from Croatia. In line with the catch-the-eye
 system, I have now noted down four requests to speak. I draw your attention to Rule 38, which states that after a statement by the Commission, Members ‘may put brief and concise questions’. Please note that in this instance, ‘concise’ means one minute.
President.  
 The next item is the joint debate on the following four oral questions to the Commission on achieving the correct implementation of the EC/Israel Association Agreement: - O-0019/2004
 – B5-0067/2004
 by Mr Lagendijk on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance; - O-0021/2004
 – B5-0068/2004
 by Mrs Morgantini on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left; - O-0024/2004
 – B5-0069/2004
 by Mr Watson on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party; - O-0025/2004
 – B5-0070/2004
 by Mr Sakellariou on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
President.  
 Mr Sakellariou, I would prefer you not to make such a request. Mr Liikanen cannot help it if his flight has landed late. He arrived at the airport on time, but his plane was delayed because of weather conditions, so it may be another ten minutes before he arrives. We must, however, avoid a situation in which instead of starting at 12 noon as scheduled, voting does not start until 12.15 or even 12.20. You are well aware that it is very irritating for honourable Members if voting starts late. I would suggest that we should give the floor to the first authors of the questions, as they are familiar with the subject, before the Commissioner joins us, and the Commissioner also knows what they wish to say. We can then continue once the Commissioner is with us, and he will be in a position to answer immediately. That is my suggestion.
President. 
  We have a request then, an official request. Do you wish to pursue your request, Mr Sakellariou? We have a speaker in favour of that request. So what I wish to ask now is whether anyone is opposed to our suspending the sitting, anyone who is in favour of our continuing this debate even if the Commissioner may not arrive for five or ten minutes? Does anyone wish to speak against the request? It seems not. We need to vote on this then: could I please have a show of hands from those supporting Mr Sakellariou's request that we should suspend the sitting for ten minutes until the Commissioner arrives? Those against please? Are there any abstentions? (The sitting was suspended at 11.05 a.m. pending the arrival of the Commission and resumed at 11.15 a.m.)
President.  
 An example of Italian grandezza
, elegance and courtesy.
President.  
 Thank you very much, Commissioner Liikanen. The debate is closed.

President.  
 Thank you, Mrs Wallström. As you know, the vote has been deferred to a later sitting. The debate is closed.
President.  
 The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports, presented on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development: - A5-0123/2004
 by Mr Daul on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers; - A5-0106/2004
 by Mr Lavarra on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the common organisation of the market in olive oil and table olives and amending Regulation (EEC) No 827/68.
President.

 – 2001/0310(COD)).
President. –

President. –  
Thank you, Commissioner. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 am.

 Madam President, let me begin by saying that Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell is an outstanding candidate for this post. It is quite obvious: she has great charisma, she has high-level and demonstrable expertise, and she has a wealth of experience in the field of monetary policy. She meets all the requirements to perform her new role in the service of our monetary system and the euro. What I particularly liked was that when she was responding to the questions from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, she excelled with her brief, concise and persuasive answers. What is also important is that she supports the European Central Bank's basic policy direction, with price stability as the primary objective, and also the new shape of the European Central Bank's pillar structure. Mr Goebbels, let me tell you that even the new constitution – in its present Article 21 – states that the European Central Bank must guarantee price stability as its primary objective. Of course, it contributes to the achievement of the Union's other goals as well. In this respect, the European Central Bank has performed outstanding work to date. The euro is a stable currency at domestic level, while its value on the external markets is currently amazing almost the entire financial world. What is more, the euro is already making a significant contribution to stabilising the world currency markets. The Maastricht Treaty has also proved its worth inasmuch as re-election is not an option, which means that Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell will be appointed for eight years. What is particularly appealing is the fact that we will have a lady as the successor to the outgoing female member from Finland; this demonstrates that we are attempting to ensure that women are appointed on an equal basis to high-level positions. I am wholeheartedly committed to the central importance of the European Central Bank's objectives. In Germany, the largest Member State in the monetary union, it would be a great mistake if we tried to address our acute problems through the simple but extremely dangerous strategy of taking on further debt and raising taxes. Of course, I cannot rule out that the time may come when a further cut in interest rates, as part of the European Central Bank's policy on interest rates, may reduce the gap with rates in the United States and stimulate business investment and performance. Since the candidate – as Mr Goebbels has indirectly pointed out – also meets the main requirements laid down in the Treaty, namely recognised standing and professional experience in monetary and banking matters, I believe that we can support her appointment with a clear conscience. I would like to wish Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell every success, so that Europe can genuinely develop into what we need, namely the most dynamic economic area in the world, offering job opportunities for our young people. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just come to an understanding on a few more points with a view to making the voting procedure easier for you. By agreement with my honourable colleagues, I should therefore like to propose that, beginning with the Committee’s Amendment No 10, we consolidate the votes into four blocks. I have already indicated to the Bureau how these blocks can be arranged so that we can deal with the whole proposal fairly quickly, and I should like to ask your permission, Mr President, to present a brief oral proposal for a compromise before the vote on Article 3(2)(a) and before the vote on Article 16.
Wuermeling (PPE-DE

rapporteur

 (DE) 
Mr President, we are dealing here with the applicability of the Directive to agreements relating to small amounts of credit or those covering particularly large amounts. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled an amendment proposing that the coverage threshold for microcredits be drawn at EUR 500. I should like to combine this amendment with Amendment No 175, tabled by the Group of the European Socialists with a view to setting an upper limit of EUR 100 000. That would be a sensible joint solution. If it secures a large majority, there is a good chance that it will serve as the basis for further deliberations within the Council.
Wuermeling (PPE-DE

 (DE) 
Mr President, the Commission proposed a ban on doorstep negotiation of credit agreements. The committee called for this ban to be completely scrapped. We approved that motion. So there is no longer any scope for a reduced ban as proposed in Amendment No 206. It is therefore correct that Amendment No 206 should fall.
Wuermeling (PPE-DE
),  
rapporteur
. –
 (DE) 
Ladies and gentlemen, a majority of you have come out against the inclusion of any rule on doorstep selling, and with good reason too. The fact is that a separate directive covers these matters, and in the wake of this vote there is no more scope for the inclusion in the present directive of other rules on the same subject. I still say that the amendment should fall.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, honoured visitors, I would like to start by thanking most warmly all those who have played their part in drawing up this report, which is a very complex and comprehensive one. We were, unfortunately, obliged to consider a Commission proposal that was not entirely consistently thought through, that was sloppily worded and had not taken account, above all, of the serious consequences it would have for consumers, for example on their access to credit. We in the committee therefore had to propose extensive changes to this directive, achieving the sad record of 650 amendments to what have to date been 38 articles, but your concentrated collaboration means that it has now been possible to assemble all this into a genuinely consistent whole. Nor must I let this opportunity go by without very warmly thanking Parliament’s Bureau and the groups’ secretariat, not to mention my own staff, for the endless hours they devoted to this project. I can tell the House that what the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market wishes to do by means of this proposal is to send out three signals. One carries the message that the European internal market needs the best possible consumer protection. We will achieve this if we combine the European Union’s minimum standards with the legislation of individual states, but if, on the other hand, we were to take the approach of harmonising everything or as much as possible, that would amount to only the minimum of protection for the consumer. This is where I want to express my disagreement with what Commissioner Byrne had to say. The fact is that I get the impression that what matters most of all to the Commission is that consumer law in this area should be completely centralised, with the European Union alone being entitled to do anything that has to do with consumer protection. That would not, however, be objectively reasonable, as the national markets still differ to a large extent, and it is there that there must be a rapid and flexible response when improper business practices crop up. Secondly, we are sending the message that financial markets need to be opened up to individual consumers too. We want the standards of protection not only to enhance public confidence in e-
commerce and in buying by mail order, but also to encourage the public to seek out offers throughout the internal market in order, eventually, to find credit on favourable terms. Thirdly, we are signalling our opposition to over-regulation and bureaucracy, for there is, quite simply, no sense in deluging ordinary customers – responsible adults though they may be – with a flood of information that they cannot read, let alone understand; hence our proposal for clear technical information that will provide consumers with the key facts on their loans at a glance. We also made it our concern to maintain access to credit facilities particularly for the man and woman in the street and for the vulnerable members of society. It is these sectors of the population who need short-term loans simply to stay on top of day-to-day life. The end result of the Commission proposal would have been that the only people who could get credit would be those who had no need of it. There are two more specific points I would like to address briefly, and these are still subject to discussion between the groups. The first has to do with the entitlement to early repayment. One position on this is that this should generally be permitted, and without any additional costs being incurred, whilst the other is that consumers should be allowed to choose between fixed-term loans and those capable of being repaid early. In view of the fact that we have still not yet come to an agreement on this, let me draw still closer to the Group of the Party of European Socialists; you will have seen that I have already tabled a compromise amendment, Amendment No 173, in which I propose that, where loans are taken out for a period of over three years, it should be possible to repay them at any time. I would now like to add to that by combining it with Amendment No 96 as recommended by the committee, whose effect is to bring about a commensurate reduction in costs in this case. Even though there are some points from today’s debate that I wanted to mention, let me bring this speech to a close. I see this package of reports – Mrs Gebhardt’s, Mrs Ghilardotti’s, and my own – as the culmination and conclusion of our legislative work in the field of consumer law. We have always managed to discharge our responsibilities in a state of tension between the demands of the internal market and those of consumer protection, and what we have put before you I see as being a single piece of mature legislation. Whatever our differences about the details, then, I hope that they will receive the general support of the House.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Zappalà, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to join in the expressions of thanks. If, though, I compare the speeches that have been made here, I have the impression that the ship has come into several different harbours. I would like to share my own image of this harbour with you. Initially, it is true, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats did reject the common position. We take the view, however, that a number of substantial improvements have been achieved in the conciliation process, bringing the compromise more into line with our ideas, so that we can now vote for the outcome at third reading. In my view, these improvements lie primarily in the fact that this compromise proposal has a far more market-oriented focus than was the case even with the common position. The progress on liberalising public procurement through the internal market is maintained and, indeed, built on. We were worried that through the overemphasis on environmental and social criteria, the internal market would be rolled back compared with the position achieved in 1993. Thanks to Mrs Cederschiöld’s inspired leadership, but also due to the very substantial support from the Commission, this threat has been averted, so we can now vote in favour of this compromise result. We have not achieved all that we set out to achieve. The proposal still contains a number of very bureaucratic rules, some highly complex regulations and obscure phrasing. It is therefore not entirely in line with what we wanted in terms of better legislation. Nonetheless, I think it is also a step towards reaching the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, and I am pleased that the Commission in particular has made such a substantial contribution, which we see lacking in the context of some other legislative proposals. I would like to thank everyone for the very positive cooperation. It is nice to be able to finish something that we started in this legislative term, and so we will all breathe a sigh of relief when we leave the Chamber today.
Wuermeling (PPE-DE

  (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say that I definitely support the proposal that we should vote right now on the motion for referral. Members cannot be expected to come to this Chamber half an hour before midnight tonight just to decide whether or not a debate is to take place. Any majority would be quite fortuitous. Such a thing is not commensurate with the importance of this proposal. At the same time, though, I would ask you to give me the floor, so that I may oppose this referral without debate.
Wuermeling (PPE-DE
),  
rapporteur
.  (DE)
 Mr President, as regards my report, the arrangement is meant to be that we all agree the report being referred back to the committee without further debate and without a vote. I am, though, able to take this opportunity to give a brief explanation of what the report contains and what it aims to do. This is one of the few proposals that will directly affect every citizen in the European Union in his or her daily life, and will do so in a very sensitive area, that being money. The directive will affect you if you pay by credit card, if you hire a car, if you buy a television set on credit or if your bank account is overdrawn. At this moment, in the European Union, the consumer credit agreements currently in force account for something like a billion euros. That is why it is of the utmost importance that Parliament should handle this issue with all possible care and with a great sense of responsibility. In the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we get the impression that the Commission’s proposal does not do justice to the importance of this issue. There has been no scrutiny of to what extent the proposal will, in effect, prevent the socially disadvantaged from getting any access whatever to loans, as substantially tighter conditions apply to checks on creditworthiness, which could result in those who particularly need credit no longer being given any. It has not been considered, either, to what extent this proposal might result in an increase in consumer credit interest rates. The Chemicals Directive, for example, is contentious enough, but at least we know what it is going to cost, which we do not with this one. Nor has there been any examination of what effects the intended restriction of consumer credit will have on consumption in the European Union, considering that consumer credit funds 13% of it. That is why the Committee on Legal Affairs has decided on an admittedly extraordinary course of action and recommended to the Commission that it withdraw the proposal, revise it in the light of all these points – there are another thirty of them in my report – and rethink the whole thing before it again comes up for debate. I can understand why some Members are saying, after the Commission has stated its unwillingness to withdraw the proposal – Mr Prodi has done so in a letter, Mr Byrne has said it time out of number – that there is little point in having another plenary vote on the whole thing. The question in fact arises as to whether there is any sense, under these circumstances, in again entrusting the Commission with the drafting of a proposal. Speaking personally, I have little confidence in its responsible departments coming up with something that we would find more manageable. I hope you do not mind me speaking in such personal terms. In view of the Commission’s refusal, in any case, to revise the proposal, I agree that we should get down to the task of rewriting the whole of the directive. I do not actually regard this as one of this House’s functions – we are meant to take policy decisions rather than to formulate individual articles – but if the Commission is proving to be so obtuse on this point, it is for us a constitutional duty, a duty that we will discharge, and, having done so, we will see to it that European consumer credit law is modern, flexible and promotes competitiveness. Thank you very much. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mrs McCarthy, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my warm thanks to the rapporteur for her excellent work on this report. Mrs McCarthy, you had to overcome two major problems not usually faced by rapporteurs. Firstly, this is a highly complex topic, involving both legal issues and complicated technical matters. Secondly, you also had to deal with a sometimes very aggressive, but sometimes also very irrational lobby, yet you ultimately managed to establish an ongoing dialogue, even though you undoubtedly found this difficult at times, as the rest of us did occasionally as well. No, ladies and gentlemen, we do not want any general patenting of any software. We do not want to strengthen the market power and monopolies of the software giants. No, we do not want to threaten the commercial bases of small and medium-sized software companies. And no, we do not want to undermine the successful open source community and Linux technology in any way. So what do we want? We want to make a sensible distinction between computer-implemented technical inventions, on the one hand – which must of course be patentable – and pure software for ordinary data processing, which should not be patentable, on the other. It is true that in the past, the European Patent Office has handed out far too many patents far too lightly. Mrs McCarthy has cited the most recent example of Amazon’s 'one-click' shopping method. However, only the legislator can bring this harmful trend to a halt. It makes no sense whatsoever to be opposed to this directive, because then these practices will simply continue. I am therefore at a loss to understand how anyone – especially the open source community – can be opposed to any form of directive in this area, as this would simply allow the current practice, which this community views very critically, to continue. On the other hand, it is also true that an invention, in the classical sense, deserves to be protected by legislation. The inventor has invested time and money in his invention, and it is of course quite unacceptable for the state to stand and watch while others exploit his ideas commercially. In this area, the issue of the European Union’s competitiveness must therefore also be discussed, for if we go so far in our directive that virtually every software element results in an invention no longer being patentable, we will be at a major disadvantage in the global competition for innovation. We should be aware of this. The proposal by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market improves the directive on key points. It limits the tendency to issue patents too casually, which has been criticised here, and it does so more effectively than the Commission’s original proposal. The new Article 4A, with its negative examples, creates watertight protection against the patenting of software, because we are saying quite clearly that pure software cannot be patented, business methods cannot be patented, and algorithms and data processing cannot be patented either. What we need is a European patent law to promote innovation, one that contains clear and sensible rules and draws a watertight border against pure software. This directive achieves these goals.

 Mr President, if I have observed correctly, you have not yet taken a vote on Amendment No 75 tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats.

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, with this report, Parliament is getting the new year off to a good start – such a good start, that I have almost forgotten that I have forgotten to wear a tie. Ladies and gentlemen, this report's political message is that Europe's Parliament is drawing much closer to its regions, thus abandoning its former attitude, which was somewhat aloof. As far as the regions' right of appeal is concerned, I am glad that we have already come to an understanding about so much. We have agreed that the situation demands that the regions should have the option of laying claims before the European Court of Justice. We are also as one in believing that, on the other hand, the Member States must have some sort of monitoring role in this. In practice, this means that all that remains to be decided is what the role of the Member States is to be. Mr Corbett, your compromise proposes that it is only to the Member States that the regions should be able to make some sort of application, but that, unfortunately, gets us no further and is no sort of compromise. The fact is that the regions can of course do that already. Furthermore, it labours under the great disadvantage that we would be doing precisely what you advise us not to do, in that we would be interfering in the relationship between the regions and the Member States, and prescribing what that relationship should be. That is why I wish, again, to commend to you the compromise motion No 24, which would enable the regions to appeal under the Member States' supervision, as it were. This would leave room for flexible solutions in all the Member States, solutions that might be different in Germany from what they are in Great Britain. For this reason, I really do beg you to reconsider this. This is a sensitive issue for the regions, who are awaiting a signal from us, and I would be glad if we could join in sending that signal tomorrow. (Applause)

Mr President, thank you for 
amending the list of speakers so that I could rise as well. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is very concerned about the fact that at the European Court of Justice, there continues to be a massive backlog of translation work. What does this mean in practice? Let's assume that in a specific case, proceedings have ended and a judgment has been handed down. As the Court of Justice – unlike other Community institutions – does not publish its decisions until they are available in all the Community languages, the backlog of translations means that the finished judgments stay in a drawer at the ECJ for between one and two years until they can be published. This is an untenable situation, in my view. It is also increasingly viewed as a problem by the national courts in the Member States, since in the case of preliminary rulings, the proceedings in the European Court of Justice are merely interim proceedings in the successive stages of appeal through the national courts. This means that these two years do not complete the proceedings; these two years are in addition to the duration of proceedings in the Member State. We therefore call for adequate resources to be made available in order to bring this untenable situation to an end. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is also responsible for issues relating to the internal market and enlargement. We have always focussed particularly on the specific challenges facing the internal market as a result of enlargement, especially for border regions. We therefore fully endorse the amendments which aim to ensure that in line with last year's pledge, the funding for the pilot programme for SMEs is pegged at EUR 15 million.

 Mr President, that is not what we agreed on this point in the debates in committee and in the group. The point is, we do not start this sort of procedure unless there is some prospect of obtaining the required majorities further down the line in this difficult procedure to establish human rights violations in Member States. That is why we are opposed to this oral amendment.

Mr President, we in the PPE-DE Group tabled both Amendment No 142 and Amendment No 144 on this point. Now that Amendment No 142 has been accepted, we do not, I think, need to vote on Amendment No 144, because it deals with the same issue.
Wuermeling (PPE-DE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, the services have pointed out that the proposed amendments are identical. However, that is not the case in all the language versions and, even in the English version, there are interesting differences between the version in the committee report and the version now before plenary. The point is, do we call for the High Representative to be present at foreign and security policy debates or do we word it more politely by saying he should be invited. I think that, as we are talking about foreign and security policy, we should opt for the diplomatic wording, as contained in Amendments Nos 120 and 174.

Mr President, I should just like to make a brief comment here. The fact of the matter is, we should be obliged to examine the financial impact of committee reports. Rule 159 refers at one point to legislative reports. We have already adopted the wording for that. Article 160 refers to non-legislative reports, but we should ensure that the same wording is used in both cases because, materially, it makes no difference if a financial statement is drawn up for a legislative or a non-legislative report. In this respect, having voted on Amendment No 88, there should in fact be no need to vote again here.

 Madam President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is very pleased that the chapters on the internal market and the related chapters have already been negotiated successfully. In this respect, we can claim that the internal market already exists. However, we are still concerned about the shortcomings in the administrative and judicial systems in the future Member States. I would like to tell you something which I found out at the weekend in Prague, namely that the process of registering a foreign commercial company in the Czech trade register takes about a year – unless you are prepared to pay EUR 2000. In the internal market, no gap should open up between rights and duties as a result of the failure to enforce environmental, social and consumer standards. We need fair competition, also in the enlarged internal market. I should like to thank Mrs Sommer for her report. It provides a strong impetus towards fruitful cooperation and cohesion at the interface between East and West in the border regions. Giving priority to SMEs is something we strongly support, and we hope that this will be implemented in forthcoming calls for proposals.

 Madam President, I am very grateful for that reply. I must start by apologising for my somewhat late arrival, but I am glad that I managed to get here. As you will be aware, we are reforming our Rules of Procedure, a process in which I play a part as a shadow rapporteur, and people are getting very touchy about it all. I would like to start by thanking the Commission for committing itself to plugging the gaps between the trans-European transport network in the European Union and the TINA network in the candidate countries. That is very important. It has submitted proposals for completing the trans-European networks and has also made financial commitments in this connection. This is, in my view, a very good thing. In the regions we live in, individual infrastructure projects are now, of course, the subject of heated debate. The reason why I am putting this supplementary question is that we still do not have a more or less reliable indication of by what percentage freight traffic, in particular, is expected to increase. It would be very important for us to know that, as it would also be for the public, for whom new transport links bring disadvantages to be endured.

 Mr President, I would have liked a bit more time to prepare my speech, but that means I will certainly keep to the speaking time. Parliament must become the Centre Court of European debate. That is our ambition, but on its own it is of course not enough for us to want it; we also have to adapt our ways of operating accordingly. That, I think, is at the heart of the report that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has adopted. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats strongly supports this objective. We wish to thank Mr Corbett most warmly for the multitude of ideas he has elaborated here, which will carry us further forward. We wish to thank him for his meticulous work on highly complex legal material. We also wish to thank him for his exemplary cooperation and frankness, which have been a hallmark of this consultation process, which has gone on for a year and a half already. We want our work to become more political, for us to concentrate on the essentials, and we also want to organise it in a more responsible way. We want the current affairs debate, which is soon to be introduced, to make us more political. It is quite extraordinary that we have to make use of instrumental crowbars in order to get a current issue into this honourable House. We have to demand statements by the Commission or the Council in order to be able to express ourselves on the burning political issues of the day. One consequence of that is that the spectacle the European summits provide continues to get more attention than the decisions reached in this Parliament of ours. We need changes to our Rules of Procedure in order to achieve better balance in this respect. We also want to work in a more concentrated way. We need to do without time-consuming routine resolutions, even though many Members have become attached to them. We need a simplified procedure for uncontroversial reports in order to be able to concentrate on our legislative work. We in this House are all aware that by now some 80% of European legislation needs Parliament's consent, but I doubt whether more than half of our time in plenary session is spent on legislative work. We should also do something about working in a somewhat more responsible manner once our decisions have acquired legal effect and become something more than just demands and resolutions. That is why the proposal is rightly made to give the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market greater responsibility for compatibility with the Budget and with the law. There is no point in us making demands that cannot come to anything due to financial considerations or the absence of any basis in law. At the same time, though, we want to safeguard the rights of individual MEPs and those of the groups. It goes without saying that Members of this Parliament must have the right to speak here in their mother tongue, and that the groups must be entitled to put motions, but the prospect of eastward enlargement and the need to prevent this House being fragmented requires us to tighten up somewhat the conditions for the formation of groups. If I may mention my personal view, individual arrangements for bringing texts into plenary without them being discussed in committee have to be restricted, in order to enable them to be better prepared, and we have to limit them to really urgent cases. I say this with particular reference to the matters for urgent debate, which have recently developed into a procedure in which a relatively small number of Members are able to pass Parliamentary resolutions at a point when most of us are already on our way home. The procedure has to guarantee that as many Members as are able attend the group and committee discussions. Exceptions should be permitted only in cases of real urgency. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports changes in this House that improve the way we work, making us more political, more visible and the European Union more democratic.

 I greatly welcome the decision to include the autobahn through the Fichtelgebirge in the Trans-European Networks. Eastward enlargement, from which the border regions can derive great benefit, must not be allowed to be held up by traffic jams. At the same time, there is a need to create an efficient road transport infrastructure to avoid the strain imposed by slow traffic. The doubling of cross-border journeys is still something we have to reckon with.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually also of the opinion that this report represents a genuine step forward in the debate on the competences of Europe – not only intellectually, but also politically. I will thank Mr Lamassoure not only for thinking deeply, but also for listening intently during our debates. Above all, I see this report as carrying two messages. As MEPs, we also want to be given definite responsibilities. Our defence against the charge of centralist interference is that it is clearly laid down what we are competent to do and what we are not competent to do. The second message contained in the report is that we want more Europe in external relations, and more Europe in the worldwide representation of European interests, but that we are also ready to do without one thing or another in internal matters and leave detailed rules to the Member States. It is interesting that a success has been made of decentralisation in recent years, not only in all the EU's Member States, but also in the acceding countries. Even enterprises that work on a global scale act according to the principle of ‘small units and big networks’. Hence it is in our own interests that we should, as MEPs, concentrate on the core competences we possess and should also give that outward expression. The Commission has been remarkably bold in this respect; you, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Barnier, and your fellow-Commissioner Mr Vitorino too, have had something to say about this yourselves. This report offers our citizens – even the Euro-sceptics – a modern, effective, and transparent Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now agreed to six amendments to the Rules of Procedure by the necessary majority; we now have to vote on a proposal for a decision, the first paragraph of which states that these amendments to the Rules of Procedure are to be adopted. This amounts to a kind of final vote, which as I see it is unnecessary in accordance with Rule 180(2) of the Rules of Procedure. I would accordingly ask you to refrain from voting on paragraph 1. This will also enable us to avoid another problem: paragraph 1 would require 314 votes for it to be adopted, whereas paragraph 2 would only need a simple majority.

Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Malmström, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, not only for having familiarised herself with these difficult processes but also for having conducted the negotiations on the subject with the Commission with the rigour, prudence, but also the friendliness that they call for. I believe that this result will, both for the Commission and the other institutions have a calming effect on procedures which, over and over again, have led in the short or long term to disputes that might well have been unnecessary. For us, this result makes it possible to make debate on the Commission's annual work programme more political, getting away from listing individual projects somewhat in the manner of a book-keeper, indeed, it makes it possible for us to set out at the start of the year, what we see as the European Union's most important projects in the coming year. One might say that this procedure and the preparation for it make this annual work programme interactive. I believe that this represents a move forward in terms of the reliability and predictability of the processes we are considering. As Mrs Malmström has rightly emphasised, this result also makes demands of us ourselves, for we really must refrain from constantly repeating what we wanted already, and must instead actually limit our deliberations to a period of one year. It is also necessary for us to become more closely involved than before in the actual planning of the half-year presidencies, which may go against our own priorities. Involvement in the preparation of the legislative programme is important to us also because we still do not possess the right of initiative in the European legislative process. On that, let me say something about my personal assessment of the position. Our spontaneous reaction when the Commission's sole right of initiative is called into question is always a cool one. Above all, the Commission itself reacts understandably with great reserve on that point. Despite that, we must of course consider whether we should raise the issue anew, perhaps within the framework of the Convention's discussions, for it is the case that the European Union's great acquis communautaire
, consisting of some 10 000 instruments, can be amended only on the Commission's proposal. I will say here that I doubt whether that satisfies the requirements of a democracy. To that extent the decision we are drawing up today, is also a crutch, helping Parliament to move towards enhanced involvement in initiatives.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my heartfelt thanks and respect are owed to the rapporteur, who has drafted this material with much energy, discipline and intelligence. I admire him most of all for not losing his Roman cheerfulness despite what was at times a very difficult process. Many thanks also to my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, where we had what I think was one of our most interesting debates to date. The discussions in this House have also shown that views on threshold values and social standards cut across Group lines, and we can look forward to tomorrow's vote with great excitement. I see a requirement for the new Directives to be progressive, fair and functional. We support the modernisation proposed by the Commission, for example with regard to the introduction of electronic auctions and the electronic submission of tenders. What greatly worries me, though, is that on one point the Directive is not being made fairer. I am referring here to the issue of social and environmental standards. It is for the benefit of the other members of my group that I would like to expressly reiterate that the issue is not, for us, that social and environmental criteria have no part to play in the procedure whereby contracts are awarded. No! Mr Hager has shown that very clearly. These standards must be laid down in the description of the product. We want to avoid the situation where, when the contract is awarded at the end of the process and the tenders have been compared and it is clear that tender no. 1 is the best in economic terms, no. 2 is worse, no. 3 is even worse than that and no. 4 is the worst of all, there is then another assessment which establishes that one firm is more socially responsible because it employs more disabled people and another more ecological because it has a waste management system, whereupon it is decided, despite the fact that there was another tender which was better in economic terms, to award the contract to the more expensive firm after all. That is the situation we want to avoid, for it would run counter to the internal market. That is why this is such an important point for us, and a Directive with standards of that sort would basically be no use to us anymore.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lehne, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to know how many legal transactions have taken place in the European Union during the last 15 minutes, while we have been debating. Would it be a million, 10 million or even 100 million? Whatever, I believe that it must be a large figure. We are in a world of what in German we call "Massengeschäfte
" a term that is not perhaps particularly easy to translate into other languages – bread-and-butter transactions, perhaps. I am sure that only a fraction of these legal transactions will have been cross-border, and I am equally sure that these transactions, ranging from Lapland to Sicily, from Scotland to Bavaria, will have been conducted according to totally different traditions and customs. That is why we need to be clear that this is a very sensitive area and however ambitious we may be, we still need to proceed very carefully and prudently. Mrs Wallis has already referred to the reaction in the United Kingdom, for example. So I think it is reasonable for the Commission to propose in its Option II that we should initially work out some general legal principles. One expert very appositely said that the problem with legal convergence is not so much the rules as the exceptions. We have discovered precisely that through our own work, in the case of warranty periods on purchases, interest on arrears, money laundering and also the takeover directive. General principles can be agreed quickly, but in contrast it is very difficult to harmonise which groups should be given special treatment and who qualifies for special protection. That is why we also need to set reasonable priorities for our work. The cross-border aspects should be prioritised in the first place. We need to achieve compatibility between European legislation and national legislation, but national legislative provisions also need to be made compatible with each other. Courts need to cooperate more effectively and mutual legal assistance needs to be guaranteed. I believe that these are concrete, practical steps that we can implement from one day to the next, which would assist legal transactions between our citizens within the single market. I think that in considering these matters, we should also deal with the concept of working towards a European law as an option for parties entering into contracts. They could therefore choose either to opt for a legal system created in Europe or else continue to use national law. As I see it, this would be a kind of soft harmonisation, setting in train a process of convergence which, Mr MacCormick, would be better than regulations adopted as an abrupt event, as Mrs Wallis put it. Against this background I would also like to say that Mr Lehne's draft does not, of course, reiterate the demands that we made in 1989 and 1994. At that time we demanded that a European Civil Code should be drawn up, but as far as I can see, that proposal has not been incorporated in the texts adopted in committee nor in the amendments. We have adopted a good, reasonable and cautious approach here. I would like to thank both the rapporteur and all those who helped with the hearing for their assistance. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mr Cashman, ladies and gentlemen, if, today, the window of the European Parliament is opened a little wider, as Mr MacCormick has put it, then Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman will have played a great part in it. Thank you for your commitment and congratulations on the success you have achieved in making us more open. I certainly do not see myself as groping in the dark, as Mr Bonde put it, but I do think we are on the road towards the light. Tomorrow's resolution will also be our invitation to the citizens of the European Union to put our openness to good use, to look in on us, to, if you want to put it that way, take a look at the cards we hold, even to see behind the scenes. Openness makes little sense, of course, if nobody is interested in the work we do. We do not wish to complain about the lack of interest on the part of our citizens and voters, but we would like to seriously urge them to avail themselves of this new openness on the part of the European Parliament, as today's technology makes things conceivable which a few years ago would not have been possible. With the click of a mouse, they can see the original texts we discuss in this House. Even if press reports on Europe are sometimes incomplete, the interested citizen can nonetheless look straight in on us with the help of the Internet. That is an opportunity, and because of it we strongly support this report. I would have liked to say something to the representative of the Council of Ministers. Unfortunately, he is not here, but there was not going to be much to say about transparency.

Mr President, Mr Carnero, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, am glad that the history of this legal contradiction will, it is to be hoped, come to its end for the time being when we adopt Mr Carnero's report tomorrow. Thank you very much, Mr Carnero, for the good work you have done, and, also, for finding your way through this apparently very technical material and bringing out the political dimension to the decision we are to take. In political terms, of course, it is a matter of some significance whether the chairpersons of the joint parliamentary committees and of the interparliamentary delegations are appointed en bloc
 by this, albeit rather thinned-out, House or whether every single candidate in every single joint parliamentary committee or every single interparliamentary delegation has to be elected or appointed as an individual. It is, of course, clear that the Rules of Procedure have to provide for a process ensuring political balance in the composition of the delegations and the joint parliamentary committees. It is likewise clear that the results of that process also have to be implemented and that this, too, can be safeguarded by the Rules of Procedure. It is also evident, on the other hand, that these important decisions about personnel cannot be completely removed from the plenary. We must, then, be clear in our own minds that the joint committees and interparliamentary delegations perform duties of a distinctly sensitive nature with respect to our partner countries, and also that the appointment of certain persons to chair these committees can become a political issue, may be seen as discourteous or even taken to be provocative. It must therefore be possible for this plenary to retain control over who is actually appointed to the offices in question. We cannot, then, have the situation in which Parliament gives, as it were, carte blanche
 for the appointment to specific positions, only for the individual groups, or even national delegations within them, to decide at the end of the day who is to be appointed. Parliament must hold on to its supremacy in this respect. I believe this also means that it must be ensured that, when we reassemble in January, we at least know the names of the people involved before proceeding to the ballot. This was not in fact the case at the start of this Parliamentary term. In the medium term, though, I think we must consider handing over the responsibility to the joint committees and delegations. That is where the Members sit who know the relationships with the partner countries and their sensitive aspects. In the long term too, they should also bear responsibility for deciding who should preside over them.

 Mr President, Mrs Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market devoted a great deal of attention to market integration in connection with the eastward enlargement. The effects that will be manifested by this integration must also be taken into account when planning the Budget. We see, looking at the Four Freedoms, that there will be no difficulties in some areas, but problems with adaptation in others. There will be no great changes to the movement of goods, because substantial liberalisation has occurred, nor in freedom of establishment, because the person or business is subject to the laws of the state in which they establish themselves. We will, though, have problems with integration as regards the free movement of labour and the freedom to provide services, for the precise reason that there has been to date no competition in these areas, and these markets are only regionally oriented unless they choose to be otherwise. The frontier regions will therefore come under particular pressure when the freedoms in question are introduced. Specific aid measures are therefore needed. The recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market make it clear that it advocates endowing the frontier regions programme that you, Commissioner, mentioned, with additional resources. We are grateful to the Committee on Budgets and especially to the rapporteur for their accepting these suggestions and, in part, adding to them. One point in particular is of importance to me: the instruments proposed by the Commission are not sufficient to strengthen competitiveness in the frontier regions, as they promote only cooperation between East and West rather than the specific situation of the frontier regions themselves. A specific programme is therefore needed, and so we request the Commission to present a legal foundation for it; I take their statements to mean that they are prepared to do this.

Madam President, as regards the formation of Parliamentary Groups, our group expressed itself quite unambiguously at the time this Parliament was constituted. We are grateful for this confirmation of our understanding of the law. Further to certain remarks by Members, I would again like to make it clear that our Rules of Procedure, decided on by this Parliament, make a clear distinction between Members belonging to a group and pooling their rights in it, and those who do not belong to a group. Members without a group should quite clearly not be discriminated against, but that does not mean that they, as individual Members, enjoy complete equality of treatment with the groups. Rule 30 of our Rules of Procedure expressly states that Members not belonging to a group have the use of a Secretariat with all other details being decided on by the Presidents. That is now the legal position as handed down by the Court of First Instance, and we should proceed in accordance with it in the coming months. * * *

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has examined the proposal for a regulation very carefully. It obviously supports the aim of creating a European Aviation Safety Agency. However, we realise that we somehow need to harmonise the legal framework within which such agencies are created. A great many agencies have now been set up: the Aviation Safety Agency, the Food Agency, the Agency for Medical Products. It is high time we had a clear legal framework for starting up these agencies. The two previous speakers have already commented on certain aspects. I am grateful that the Commission announced in its White Paper on European governance that it intends to take a somewhat clearer line here. Sparks obviously fly when these agencies are created because decision-making powers are transferred to external institutions even if, Mr Schmitt, the final decision does not, of course, always rest with these agencies. It is especially important to us that the supervisory committees be made up of equal numbers of representatives from the various European institutions and for the European Parliament not to lose its rights of influence by outsourcing decisions. It is also important to us for the legal recourse created within these agencies' procedures to be in keeping with the European Treaties and the principles of the rule of law. Another particular cause for concern is that the powers of intervention created for these agencies need to be in keeping with the fundamental civil rights on which we agreed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We have tabled proposed amendments on these points and we are grateful that they are at least being accepted in part.

Madam President, one comment perhaps, as the question of language has already been raised twice. I should like to point out that the question of language is regulated in the Rules of Procedure, which state that Parliament itself makes the final decision on how languages are to be regulated in the House. Any concerns – including about decisions by the Bureau – are therefore totally unfounded.

 Madam President, I should first like to thank the rapporteur very warmly for his painstaking preparation of the report. The shadow rapporteurs no doubt also had a hand in this. Neither are my thanks diminished by the fact that the rapporteur has called 32 Members, of which I am one, a group of narrow-minded individuals. Nevertheless you will of course allow me first of all to repudiate this description here. On behalf of a minority in our group, I should like to express a number of reservations which we have on the proposal. It is proposed, in the extreme case, that an official who has worked in the Commission for ten years and who is 50 years of age be given early retirement with an allowance of 65% of his salary. We do not believe that a lucrative, generous early retirement scheme of this kind can be justified to the European taxpayer. When we have spent the whole day talking about the Irish referendum in the corridors and when we are always talking here about proximity to the people, may I please ask who can actually explain to a pensioner who has paid into a pension scheme for 40 years why a 50-year-old A3-grade official should be given EUR 5 500 to go for walks in the country? No one is able to explain to me why the Commission, which has 18 000 posts, is nevertheless not in a position usefully to deploy 600 officials who are obviously no longer productive. Neither is anyone able to tell me why this should now be an essential component of this Commission reform. I fear, you see, that there will be crafty, shrewd and smart officials who will succeed in benefiting from this golden handshake. In the end the good ones will go, the bad ones will stay, EUR 16 million will be spent and everyone will be disgraced!

 For the following reasons I have voted against the outcome of the conciliation procedure on the tobacco directive: According to the joint text, the export to non-EU countries of cigarettes with more than ten milligrams of condensate, more than one milligram of nicotine and more than 10 milligrams of carbon monoxide is to be prohibited. The result would be a massive fall in exports of cigarettes from the EU and hence the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the EU. Such a ban will serve no purpose at all, because the cigarettes will then be produced outside the EU. But jobs in our countries will be lost. The EU has no authority to impose such a ban. This is not about transactions in the single internal market. The anti-tobacco zealots should not act as if the export of tobacco products were something akin to handing out potassium cyanide. The EU is acting inconsistently here, given that it subsidises both the growing and the export of tobacco to the tune of one billion euros. By imposing an export ban, the EU is setting itself up as a global health freak. This is an arrogant and disparaging way to treat the customs and practices of other countries. The right approach would be to forge ahead with the work that has been started within the World Health Organization on uniform standards for tobacco products. Unilateral action by the EU will prove fruitless.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is quarter past midnight, the time when dark figures emerge from the shadows. In Strasbourg, Brussels, throughout Europe, throughout the world, across borders, crimes will be committed tonight, people will be injured, property will be damaged. In this respect, it is the right time to be talking about the GROTIUS programme. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Keßler, for her thorough preparation of the analysis of the GROTIUS programme. I think that this programme, Mr Vitorino, is one of the main elements in a European area of freedom, security and justice. I should like to make a point here, on behalf of my Group, of acknowledging the fact that the Commission has committed itself in this programme to what is, in fact, a relatively new area, given its original remit. The GROTIUS programme will create islands of competence in the application of the law which we can extend one by one and gradually increase, because we can adopt as many directives, regulations and agreements as we want; if they are not applied, all our efforts are in vain. The area of money laundering, which we have just debated, is precisely one such area in which good progress has been made in establishing the legal preconditions needed in order to fight it, including at European level. At the end of the day, however, too little use is made of these instruments. The GROTIUS programme will help to ensure that European law is not just law in the books, but law in action. I can therefore say, on behalf of my Group, that we are unreservedly in favour of continuing the GROTIUS programme and I should also like to say that it is European money extremely well spent. We welcome the basic structure of the programme because it is fully and completely in keeping with requirements regarding the application of the law. Training measures, exchange programmes, studies, seminars, publications, are exactly what allow our legal practitioners to make use of European law and European possibilities. However, I must also point out that the requirements of legal practice are very varied. That is because training systems differ, the degree to which people are affected varies widely in the various regions of the European Union and, of course, the national judicial systems have very different definitions of what they expect from individual professional groups, be they judges, public prosecutors, lawyers etc. This was also the unanimous view of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which I am also speaking on behalf of here today. The Committee on Legal Affairs numbers a great many legal practitioners. Allow me to illustrate this with a very specific example. In cities such as Frankfurt, London or Paris, training in European money laundering legislation may be crucial, while in regions on the border between Germany and France or Italy and France, it is a relatively minor problem, which is why – and this is the point which particularly concerns me – the flexibility of the GROTIUS programme is crucial to its success. Although one measure or another perhaps meets all the requirements in one Member State, it may completely bypass them in another region, which is why we wondered during our discussions if it made sense for the Commission to set focal points for training etc. in annual programmes. We feel that it makes more sense to create a flexible, pragmatic, practicable framework within which those who wish to receive further training in European law can determine the subject matter themselves and tailor the various measures accordingly. We support the programme and hope that it will continue to bear fruit for legal practice in the European Union.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Marinho, I am very pleased that this report is before us today. I would like to thank you very much for preparing a subject which at first seems very technical, but which, as you quite rightly stressed, has a very substantial part to play in creating a citizens' Europe, because cross-border business is on the increase. We have a European single market, we have a single European currency, and we will soon have the coins and notes of that currency in our pockets. Because of e-commerce, we will see exponential growth in cross-border contracts, and it is a sad fact that problems sometimes arise with contracts, resulting in legal disputes. The taking of evidence is generally at the heart of any legal dispute, as matters of law are often easy to settle, but there are often widely varying interpretations when it comes to the facts. If it is necessary to determine the facts of a case which took place in another Member State, then the present situation as regards mutual legal assistance is simply anachronistic, and involves using the Hague Convention through diplomatic channels, making matters very complicated and time-consuming, and also unreliable. A court case often comes to a standstill quite simply because the facts of the case cannot be established, and quite simply because the resources for mutual legal assistance are not available. That is why it is so important that the Federal Republic of Germany has brought forward this proposal, and that is why my group is so firmly supporting this initiative, because it provides for greater certainty, swifter administration of the law and, last but not least, greater justice for the citizens of the European Union. This legal instrument will also help to counter a trend which I view with increasing scepticism. By that I mean the tendency to resort to extrajudicial dispute resolution, that is to say bringing in a neutral arbitrator instead of going to court, or letting some kind of board of arbitration make a ruling. This is actually a trend that runs counter to the idea of the constitutional state. This is a trend, and I am happy to say so in this Chamber, which also runs counter to parliamentary democracy, because our system is, in fact, designed on the assumption that parliaments make laws and an independent judiciary apply those laws. Anything that represents a deviation from these procedures is at odds with the original concept of the constitutional state which all of us here have in our sight. If we can make cross-border legal relations easier, then we also make it easier for companies and individual citizens to operate within systems guaranteed by the State. The single market needs an efficient legal system, failing which all our efforts to create competition and increasing prosperity in the European Union will come to nothing. By way of conclusion, I must confess that it makes me feel somewhat uneasy that we keep having to consider initiatives from Member States here. I can be particularly forthright in saying that in this particular case, because this initiative emanates from my own country. I find it embarrassing that we in the European Parliament are not in a position to present such initiatives, and this report should also make us think once again about whether the European Parliament should not have a right of initiative, particularly in this area, which is such a sensitive one in the public's eyes.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning I take great pleasure in conveying a message of thanks to you this morning. Last week in Prague I had the opportunity of meeting Mr Ivan Pilip, a Member of the Czech Parliament. Mr Pilip was detained for 26 days in a Cuban jail for having established links with dissidents. He is now back in the Czech Republic, is in good spirits and thanks the President and also the Members of the European Parliament for their efforts towards his release. Mr Pilip remarked that the Czech public also felt great satisfaction in the friendship forged for his benefit between the European Parliament and the Czech state and Czech members of parliament. He is convinced that our intervention in particular played a significant role in securing his release. I would like to make it clear that I personally played very little part in this process so I am all the more delighted to be able to pass on his thanks.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to join the House in thanking the rapporteur. It is amazing how calmly and composedly he has cut his way through this jungle of interests. The lobby has already been mentioned. It was indeed persistent but, on balance, it was, I think, a fair discussion and for that, too, I am grateful. A great deal has been said about the need for balance. I am afraid that the common position has not yet struck the balance needed. Parts of the directive penalise the internal market, parts penalise consumers and parts penalise innovation. The directive penalises the internal market because, at the end of the day, the harmonisation is only cosmetic and the Member States are defending their conventional payment systems tooth and claw, even though they are basically unsuited to the digital world. We want to prevent that, which is why we suggest in proposed Amendment No 12 that the Member States should at least submit new compensation systems to the Commission and obtain a recommendation. The directive also penalises consumers because it is quite possible that consumers will have to pay once when they buy a CD or a DVD and then again in the form of a levy. Then when they come to make a copy, the data is copy-protected and the Member States have not even undertaken to look at copy protection systems and legal copying. And the common position penalises innovation because it tries desperately to keep the global fee system alive in the digital age, despite the fact that new technology basically makes global fees superfluous, because copy protection allows the rightholder to be paid directly for copies and that is the fairest solution of all. That is a directive for a citizens' Europe. It offers the citizen security and fair freedoms in the digital world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank you for still being here to take part in this debate this Thursday afternoon. I should also like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market very much for the constructive and in-depth discussion we had on this subject. I am also most grateful for the supporting opinions of the other committees, and should like to express my thanks to Mr van den Berg of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and Mr Candal of the Committee on Petitions. Indeed, we had a very earnest and also very self-critical debate about the quality of European lawmaking and the application of the principle of subsidiarity. What conclusions did we draw? We established that the quality of lawmaking leaves much to be desired, particularly in the eyes of the public. There, frustration with, but also alienation from, European law becomes apparent from time to time, and we should like to urge Parliament, but also the other Community institutions, not to shy away from paying painstaking attention to detail here, to work with precision, and also to make the necessary time and staff available to do this. But it is not only the quality of lawmaking which is crucial; we also need to be shrewd about the quantity of lawmaking, because not every problem in Europe is automatically a problem for the European Union. We expressly declare our support for the points made by the Commission in its strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005. It says that we need to concentrate on our core tasks. It can, nonetheless, be a painful process to give up dossiers on which one has been working. Unfortunately, examples from the very recent past show that the Commission, and also the European Parliament, do not always succeed. You will remember the provisions recently presented to us on climbing ladders. I remember standards for ship survey organisations – I hope that I am not causing the interpreters problems – and I remember a proposal for a Directive on ambient noise which actually intends to produce noise cards for the whole of the European Union. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market explicitly calls on the Commission to resist the legislative pressure to which it has itself objected. This is no excuse for doing things which are actually superfluous. But of course, this request is also directed at ourselves to be sparing with European regulation. We are helped here by the principle of subsidiarity which, in the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, should also be applied when deciding whether to make a particular matter the subject of internal market legislation. This principle should also be observed in full for green and white papers and for action programmes. The European Union cannot claim to have a monopoly on competence here. Here, too, specific authorisation is required, together with thorough verification of compliance with subsidiarity. On this occasion, we have also discussed a tendency which we find worrying, which is for more and more decisions to be taken away from the institutions which actually have the democratic legitimacy to do this. The introductory comments in the Commission's White Paper on good governance set us thinking. If then a comprehensive set of networks is to be formed, if more soft law is enacted, if interpretative guidelines are adopted by the Commission and if many issues are resolved by agreement between the parties concerned, then this may well all be justified, but it cannot impinge on the responsibility of the legislator. We ask the Commission here quite specifically to observe the clear demarcation of responsibilities both between the EU and the Member States and within the institutions. With this report we want to send out a signal to the public that we are taking their complaints about the deficient quality of lawmaking and the complaints about over-regionalisation and centralism seriously. I would ask you to help us to send out this signal, and to vote in favour of this report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.

 Mr President, thank you for allowing me, as rapporteur for this report, to make one additional comment on Amendment No 8 which was tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists. Much has been said about subsidiarity being a theological principle. I should like to recall a speech by John Paul II of four weeks ago in which he explicitly welcomed the fact that the principle of subsidiarity was being applied politically. I should like to recommend to all colleagues that they follow this wise piece of advice.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is a Community of law, because European law is observed and upheld. The European Court of Justice takes care of that. In so doing, it has made a considerable contribution to the success of the whole integration project over the last forty years. The European courts are currently facing major obstacles in their efforts to uphold European law, because they do not have the necessary funding available to them. There are 1600 cases pending before the European Court of Justice, and the backlog in translation work runs to 120 000 pages. As such, the European Court of Justice has become a sticking point for legal certainty. In fact, back at first reading, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market argued strongly in favour of rectifying this deplorable state of affairs and helping to reinstate the citizens’ right to see their European laws upheld, and to avoid the EU falling into disrepute as a Community of law, on account of delays. I am extremely grateful to the Committee on Budgets and the competent rapporteur for endorsing this line of argument and supporting our proposals. In particular, we will again recommend, at second reading, that 60 new posts be created at the European Court of Justice, and, in addition, that the necessary funding be made available in the budget. We also propose that EUR 3 million be set aside, with immediate effect, in order to enlist the services of freelance translators. In implementing these measures, we aim to get legal supervision back into full working order, restore people’s faith in the legal certainty of the EU, and strengthen the European Union as a Community of law.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has discussed the question of extending the internal market to the candidate countries in a highly committed and serious manner, because an internal market between such different economic areas as the European Union and the candidate countries is unprecedented in economic history. According to calculations in a study carried out on behalf of the Commission, it will take 35 years to halve the difference in the standard of living between the EU and the candidate countries. Nowhere in the world is the income differential at a border greater than between the EU and the candidate countries. Even the levels between the USA and Mexico are closer together, which is why we are in favour of a considered, flexible strategy which does justice to the challenge in the area of the internal market. In its own initiative report, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market therefore calls for the instrument of transitional arrangements to be used in order to allow the economies to grow together harmoniously. These interim solutions are not intended to set the status quo in stone but to act as intelligent buffers which adapt to changing circumstances. I am most grateful to Mr Verheugen for assuring us today that eastward enlargement is being prepared carefully; he also gave the impression that he will resist political pressure when he is asked to turn a blind eye. He has the express support of our committee there. We welcome the progress which the candidate countries have made in harmonising with European law and we encourage them to continue this sometimes arduous and difficult work. I must say, I personally have been particular impressed with the success of Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia here. However, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market knows full well that merely passing laws is not enough. They must also be applied. European law is not just law in the books; it must also be law in action in the candidate countries. Allow me, as a member of parliament from a region which directly borders a candidate country, to draw your attention to the specific situation which prevails there. The average wage on the German side is about ten times higher than it is ten kilometres further on in our neighbouring towns in the Czech Republic. The region was cut off behind the Iron Curtain and its economy is now lagging far behind. That is why structural changes are now needed in record time and why these regions which, after all, are home to some 20 million people throughout the EU – the equivalent of a medium-sized member state –, need our support in training employees, with investments in small and medium-sized enterprises and with infrastructure. We want to encourage the Commission to go ahead with its plan to draw up a work programme for the border regions which, as in the case of enlargement southwards, will, of course, also receive specific financial commitments. By coincidence, there are some people from one such region – Upper Franconia – sitting in the public galleries right now. I was talking to them just now and, to tell you the truth, these people are worried about extending their region eastwards. It is not a question of a lack of information; it is a question of perfectly justified and specific causes for concern. We must ensure that the people there do not experience enlargement eastwards primarily in the form of lost jobs and closing businesses. I therefore ask for today’s resolution to clearly state to these citizens that the European Parliament hears their concerns; that way we shall also have these people’s support for the European goal of enlargement in peace and freedom. The European Parliament must vote in favour of the accession agreements. We stand for greater openness and greater transparency in negotiations and we expressly call on the Council of Ministers not to pursue a policy of concealing the facts as far as accession negotiations are concerned and to disclose what was discussed during negotiations. Then people will put aside their fears and support the huge project of enlarging Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to congratulate you on presenting this proposal. Indeed we all hope that in the interests of the competitiveness of the European Union, this unending Community patent saga will now have a happy ending. That is why it was right – and I would like to specifically support you here – not to overburden this proposal with sensitive issues such as patent protection for biotechnology products. I also entreat my fellow Members not to raise issues of principle on language matters. This is a special field subject to special arrangements. Commissioner, with regard to jurisdiction, you just mentioned in passing that the relevant jurisdiction would of course be in Luxembourg. I hope that was not a reference to a possible location for the European Patent Court. It would possibly make more sense for it to be located in Munich together with the European Patent Office, because all the necessary expertise is available there, which would facilitate cooperation.

I voted against an export ban on stronger cigarettes for the following reasons: The Commission has proposed banning exports of cigarettes with yields of over 10 milligrammes of tar, 1 milligramme of nicotine and 10 milligrammes of carbon dioxide to third countries. This would result in a massive erosion of EU cigarette exports and the loss of several tens of thousands of jobs. This sort of ban benefits no one, because the cigarettes will simply be manufactured outside the EU. But the jobs will be lost here. The EU has absolutely no powers to enforce such a ban. It has nothing to do with the internal single market. The anti-tobacco fanatics should not act as if exporting cigarettes was tantamount to handing out cyanide. The EU is acting inconsistently, given that it also subsidises the cultivation and export of tobacco to the tune of EUR 1 billion. The EU is using an export ban to act as the health missionary of the entire world. That is presumptuous and offends the customs and practices of other countries. The right move would be to promote the work on global uniform production standards for tobacco products already begun in the World Health Organisation. Unilateral action by the EU will be pointless.

Mr President, yesterday, ladies and gentlemen, an American court awarded the nicotine victim Leslie Whiteley compensation of no less than USD 44 million. A week ago, the European Council in Lisbon spoke out in favour of a Europe of innovation. Under these circumstances the question which arises is, do we need to review our European liability law? Do we want to mimic the Americans in our liability law? How can we formulate a liability law which promotes rather than hinders innovation? We welcome the fact that the Commission has initially submitted a Green Paper on this issue because we consider it sensible to start by evaluating experience with the present directive before we start laying down new rules. As the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we are in favour, in the interests of legal security, of a clear division between compensation and punitive sanctions, a division not possible under American law. In the interests of medium-sized enterprises, we want to prevent incalculable liability risks and avoid excessive compensation for parties which have suffered minor damage at the expense of consumers as a whole since, at the end of the day, it is they who must pay for such compensation in the form of higher prices. We want a liability law which promotes innovation and does not conceal incalculable liability risks for companies launching new products. In evaluating the opinions submitted on the Green Paper, we should like the Commission to have a free rein when it assesses the need to reform the product liability directive. We would like you to evaluate the reports which you receive impartially. We think, at first glance, that the present liability law achieves a fair balance between the interests of consumers on the one hand and the interests of product manufacturers on the other. Companies must assume liability for damage to consumers without fault. At the same time, liability is statute barred after ten years and capped at EUR 75 million. We therefore take the view that a review should only be started if there is clear proof of the need to amend the directive. Caution and level-headedness are needed. Millions of cases are affected day after day. We wish the Commission every success in evaluating the results of the Green Paper.

Mr President, on behalf of the Legal Committee, for which I had the pleasure of being rapporteur, I would like to warmly welcome the rapporteur’s well-balanced resolution. In my opinion, the rapporteur has succeeded in sending out three signals in the report: to our worldwide partners, a signal of the resolve of the European Union; to our people, a signal for a human face to globalisation; and to our citizens, a signal of the parliamentary dimension of the WTO process. In this resolution, the Parliament is giving the Commission full backing for Seattle. Our message to our partners is that we are solidly behind our negotiating leaders in Seattle – as solidly as the European Alps, I would say. All the participants should be aware of this. Our second signal is to the people who sceptically oppose globalisation. We want to give the markets a worldwide framework as well. We can and we desire to bring about globalisation. The market system will keep pace with its global development and so we are following a liberal and antiprotectionist tendency. The losers in globalisation or those who support it should know that they have an advocate. Finally, we would like to state quite clearly that this Millennium Round also has a parliamentary dimension. This is indispensable because it is no longer just about the reduction of tariffs and quotas; it is also about elementary matters such as social concern, environmental protection and fair competition. We should also make this clear to the non-governmental organisations. The place for political debate on the Millennium Round in Europe is the European Parliament. The governments are not negotiating this with non-governmental organisations.

 Mr President, Mr Leinen, you now have the misfortune of having to speak between Mr von Boetticher and myself. I would therefore take the liberty of again reminding you of one aspect of what Mr von Boetticher quite correctly pointed out here, namely that it is also a part of this package that a clear framework of competences of the European Union is to be laid down in the general, basic part of the Treaties.  Perhaps the same is true of yourself as it is of me: through the opening of accession negotiations with a further twelve potential Member States, the scales have, as it were, fallen from our eyes and we have seen what immense consequences and effects the enlargement is going to have on the European Union itself. Basically, this is not a traditional accession of States. With the union of twelve new and fifteen old Member States, we are, rather, facing the situation of a re-establishment of the Union. The necessity of comprehensive reforms has therefore been emphasised quite rightly here. I should just like to issue one warning. We ought not now to be tempted to repeat the old demands which we have always made, but now under the banner of the enlargement of the Union, for that would basically prevent us from seeing that we must consider completely new visions of our European Union.  I should like briefly in this regard to consider one idea. I am convinced that, with 27 Member States, it will be impossible for the European Union to be as active in the same breadth and depth as it is with the present fifteen Member States. We must therefore also concentrate on the key competences of the European Union and, in this connection, consider in which areas it is indispensable for the European Union to be active. I am certain that, with some good will, we can find a whole range of other areas where that is not the case.  I want to add one last remark. I should not like here to associate myself with the general European chiding directed against centralism, but I should like to canvass for a comprehensive, honest critique of the European Union’s tasks so that we do not need to be afraid that our achievements will be jeopardised through enlargement.

 Mr President, European regulations are often accused of lacking balance; either they are too bureaucratic, or they only serve certain interests, or they are even ignorant of worldwide developments. I think that we can say now that here we have an excellent example of the opposite. In the area of the approximation of laws, we must always try to find the difficult balance between necessary harmonisation, on the one hand, and consideration for the legal traditions that have evolved in Member States over the years on the other. This is an outstanding example of balance. On the one hand, a small number of clearly defined regulations relating to the requirements pertaining to electronic signatures will be laid down. On the other, Member States will be able to decide in which cases to accord these signatures equal status with conventional declarations of intent such as hand-written signatures, written proof, or other documentary evidence.  At this point, I would like to comment particularly on proposed Amendment No 2 which clarifies the rather misleading wording in Article 5(1). I would now like to emphasise once again that it was also confirmed to us by all sides in the discussions that were held in Committee that it is not automatically permitted to substitute an electronic signature with a personal one for certain form requirements as laid down by individual Member States. National legislature will have a completely free hand in deciding in which cases electronic signatures will be afforded the same status as hand-written ones.  This directive is a good example of balance between the interests of commerce, on the one hand, and the consumer on the other. What we have here is a precise, straightforward rule that lays down only a few requirements. Look at the appendices for example. But we also have the necessary protection to make such agreements binding and to make the supplier liable.  Finally, it is also a good example of, on the one hand, systematic action by the European Union within its borders, in the internal market, but is, at the same time, a way of opening up towards international cooperation. We have here a clear framework which applies first and foremost within the EU, but we have also laid down in the text of the directive itself, and this is particularly noteworthy, an openness towards international regulations. One can see very clearly in exactly this area that in terms of harmonisation within the EU, we are currently at an intermediate stage of regulation. We have the national level, we have the European level, and recently the international regulations level has increasingly been making its presence felt in more and more areas. It is good that we are clarifying here that precisely in the area of new technologies, in the area of electronic commerce, we are prepared to address these issues on a worldwide scale. Of course, this will also have a central role to play when it comes to the WTO negotiations.  I am pleased that, as a new Member of this esteemed House, I have been able, in my maiden speech, to participate in a good piece of European lawmaking, and I hope that there will be broad agreement here with what I have said and that the Council of Ministers will not have any problems in adopting the directive.

 Although we are without doubt enriched by the food from the widest possible range of countries that is to be found on the shelves of our supermarkets, consumers want to have confidence that products are safe and of high quality, and we have to create the conditions under which they can. As rapporteur of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I welcome the revision of Framework Directive 89/109/EEC, and thank Mrs Thors for her good cooperation. The Group of the European People’s Party has called for a number of crucial amendments in order to make packaging, and thus also food, safer in future. Much as the proposal for a labelling system using the legend ‘suitable for food contact’ or the symbol of a stylised glass and fork is to be welcomed, we demand that an exception be made for items that it cannot be doubted are intended for contact with food (for example, cups, glasses, etc), thereby avoiding excessive bureaucracy. We also welcome the extension of the traceability principle to the materials used, although this must not result in over-regulation; it would, for example, be nonsensical for every item of paper packaging to have to indicate the origin of every tree. As these are always mixtures, this is not technically feasible. Provided that the plenary agrees to these demands, the Group of the European People’s Party endorses the compromise negotiated with the Council.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, over and again, particular concerns are brought to me in my capacity as chairwoman of the European Parliament’s delegation to the countries of the Southern Caucasus, among which Armenia is included. First, let me thank Mr Oostlander for his report, which was a very fair one, and also for the way in which he handles Turkey’s problems with its neighbours, particularly with Armenia. There are two pre-eminent problems, and the first of them is Turkey’s economic boycott of Armenia. The closure of the Turkish-Armenian border has meant that the transport of goods to Armenia is more expensive, and this frustrates the European Union’s economic aid to that country. This also constitutes a grave breach of the Balladur Principles, which apply to all present and future candidates for accession, and according to which EU Member States must not be engaged in border disputes with neighbouring states, but must, on the contrary, maintain good relations with them. The second problem is that what has historically transpired between Turkey and Armenia has still not been worked through, and this hampers mutual understanding and prevents the development of mutual trust. Most recently, and unfortunately, Turkey has ensured that Armenia has had no part in the negotiations on energy transport and on the construction of pipelines from the region around the Caspian Sea, which is rich in natural gas and oil, and that these will not go through Armenia. All these things are justified causes for complaint by the Armenian people. It has not, so far, been possible to resolve these conflicts, which are obstacles not only to Turkey’s goal of joining the European Union, but also to that of the European Union itself, of stabilising the South Caucasus region.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, especial thanks are due to Mr Gahrton for his report and also for the close cooperation with our delegation to the South Caucasus, of which he has been constantly supportive, being always present at its meetings and always willing to give it his advice. It is very difficult for the states that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union to stand on their own feet, and all of them have similar problems in establishing democracy. The European Union’s policy objective is to encourage a willingness to live as a neighbourhood in the South Caucasus and to manage conflict. Moscow’s objectives are precisely the opposite. As we have just heard the report on Russia, let me state my view that we have to get to grips with these things as a matter of urgent necessity. Now that fourteen years have passed since the Soviet Union collapsed, it is quite bizarre that Soviet passports should still be treated as valid, and, most of all, that they should be offered to people in secessionist regions – in Georgia, for example, but also in others. That it should be possible to issue them with such passports, give them visas and make them practically independent of their own states is a very regrettable state of affairs. Many Members have already made reference to energy policy. I regret that it has not yet been possible to find a date on which to hold an energy congress here in Brussels, which this House offered to organise jointly with the Commission. I would like again to ask Commissioner Patten to do everything possible to make it, at the very least, possible for a congress of this kind to be held this year, for these states need the hope that the EU gives if they are to be able to turn away from corruption and build up truly stable democracies.

 Mr President, due to the dramatic developments in Georgia in recent weeks and the imminent presidential elections on 4 January, six groups in the European Parliament have tabled a motion for this urgent debate. With their peaceful and thankfully bloodless revolution, the Georgian people have gained a hearing and all our respect. That is convincing evidence that despite their grave economic plight, the people of Georgia are yearning for democracy. There is now a chance for a new beginning. Properly conducted elections are a prerequisite for stability and development in Georgia. A great deal of time has been wasted since the transforming events of twelve years ago. Surprisingly, Georgia’s state coffers are almost empty. Georgia has received financial assistance not only from the European Union but from many other parts of the world, but its people have gone away empty-handed. The Georgian people have high expectations of their new President. He must create a democratic order but also provide for the people’s basic needs. I would like to thank the European Parliament for making it possible for our special delegation to travel to the elections. In this way, we are also showing that in the European Parliament, we take the task of supporting peaceful development in Georgia very seriously. At the Brussels Summit, the European Union’s Heads of State or Government have just reaffirmed, yet again, the Union’s determination to build a balanced and reciprocal strategic partnership with Russia, based on the values of the rule of law, democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms and a free market economy. The national governments and the European Parliament, however, must accept that this kind of strategic partnership is only possible with states that honour their pledges. Russia has failed to fulfil the international commitments it made to Georgia in Istanbul in 1999 and by adopting this position, it has greatly obstructed democratic development in an already fragile region in the past. I can only hope that Russia will in future support constructive negotiations in all parts of Georgia, as agreed in the OSCE accords in 1999, and will not further impede democratic development. Russia plays a key role in Georgia and the entire Southern Caucasus. We in the European Parliament must address this issue when we deliberate our relations with Russia. However, our task now is to help Georgia overcome its crisis.

 In good time, the Commission has submitted its communication on ‘Wider Europe’ and clarified how it might shape its relations with its ‘New Neighbours’ following enlargement in 2004. It is regrettable that the region of the Southern Caucasus is not included in it, even though we will have immediate external borders with it when Romania accedes to membership. It is not only from televised images of the post-election demonstrations in Georgia or the confusion in Azerbaijan, also following elections, that we know how explosive the situation in these countries is. When, too, the European Commission constantly stresses that Europe has more of a presence in these countries, is exerting greater influence and providing more financial support than is generally known, it is all the more surprising that this region is not even mentioned once in such an important document on the European Union’s future relations with its eastern neighbours. I am, then, all the more grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Napoletano, and to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for remedying these defects and, in their excellent report, making explicit reference to the Southern Caucasus region. I very much hope that the Commission will take Parliament’s demands seriously.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, bathing water is making waves. Every year, at the onset of summer, the Commission draws up, on the basis of the 1976 directive, the survey of bathing waters. Not only does the European public take note of this information, but over two million visits are also made to the relevant websites. It is an established fact that bathing waters have become substantially cleaner right across Europe. In 2002, despite positively diluvian rainfall and flooding, as much as 98.5% of Europe’s coastal waters complied with the directive’s specifications. There are several reasons why it makes sense to revise the directive after over a quarter of a century. Scientific and technical knowledge have expanded at breakneck speed, any revision is to draw on the experience of up to twenty-six years of applying the directive in practice – dependent on the length of time the country has been a Member State of the European Union, the water framework directive is to be harmonised with the bathing water directive, protection of the health of bathers is to be further improved, and, last of all, the simplification of the existing laws is worth striving towards. My group shares the Commission’s intention to improve the quality of bathing water. Bathing should be promoted as a sensible leisure activity, as should the use of bathing waters for tourism in all our Member States. It is evident from what is now many years of experience that the greatest dangers to human health when bathing are presented by faecal matter finding its way into bathing waters as a result of inadequate treatment of waste water or from stock rearing. The new rules are intended to reduce from 19 to 2 the number of parameters to be measured and to treat intestinal enterococci and Escherichia coli 
as leading indicators; these two standards are to be made substantially more rigorous, but, by way of contrast, chemical parameters are disregarded and are no longer to be measured, as they are governed by other directives. Samples are to be taken less frequently if a constantly high level of water quality is found over a period of three years. The quality of bathing water is to be ascertained on the basis of changes over the past three years and no longer on the basis of one single year, so one-off eventualities – such as poor weather conditions – will be less markedly apparent. These factors would also reduce the costs involved in implementing the directive in the Member States. Our group also sees it as important that the provision of information on water quality should be improved, and that it should be more extensively disseminated via the media and the Internet. With that in mind, we endorse the Commission’s objective and also the amendments tabled to that end. Our amendments, however, are intended to bring about objectivity and simplicity and, above all, to avoid further increases in costs; hence, we do not want leisure activities to be included, and the management policies required strike us as every bit as over-the-top as the newly-introduced bathing water profiles.
 These measures will help make matters simpler in so far as they dovetail with the water framework directive; otherwise, our group takes the view that the principle of subsidiarity requires that local and regional circumstances be taken into account and dealt with in a flexible way. Some of the Commission’s proposals already run counter to these considerations, but a number of amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy even more so, and so we want to vote against these items. I see it as important that all the Member States have gathered a great deal of experience, and I take the view that we should stop trying to reinvent the wheel. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one theme of our joint debate today is a very important one, the quality of European lawmaking. One improvement to it is to be in the form of an institutional agreement between the three institutions; as for the other, the Commission, starting with the White Paper ‘European Governance’ at the end of 2001, has produced to date no fewer than sixteen comprehensive documents in the form of communications and reports on ‘European Governance and better lawmaking’. Some of these documents constitute a sort of undertaking on the part of the Commission in respect of its own work, and that is laudable. Others touch directly on Parliament’s rights as laid down in the Treaties, such as, for example, the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission, termed comitology procedures, or statements on the creation of new legal instruments, such as, for example, open coordination, self-regulation, co-regulation and similar. The new interinstitutional agreement is meant to be a sort of undertaking on the part of the three institutions to lay down the use of these instruments, which has never before been specified in any of the Treaties. Although our counterparts have done important work, and despite my gratitude to them for doing so and thus enabling themselves to really get to grips with these issues, I have to say that I am less happy about our entering into another obligation, as anyone reading the text of this interinstitutional agreement could only wonder what added value would thereby accrue to Parliament over and above its rights as laid down in the Treaties. I do not think that will amount to very much; worse still, by signing up to this agreement only a few days after the ceremonial opening of the IGC, which will also deal with this topic, and without being constrained to do so, we in this House are binding ourselves in chains and, indeed, renouncing the full use of the parliamentary prerogatives that it has taken two laborious decades to secure for ourselves. The only way Parliament has, in the past, been able to progressively extend its influence in the teeth of the Commission and the Council has been by making the utmost use of the rights accorded it by the Treaties. By signing up to interinstitutional agreements of this sort and concluding agreements with the Commission, as we did with the Lamfalussy procedure, we are ourselves again curtailing our own rights, thus, as I see it, putting everything completely the wrong way around. The quality of European lawmaking is so important an issue that we should not treat it lightly. Those on the receiving end – by which I mean the public to whom legislation applies, the Member States, which have to transpose it and all involved in implementing it at every level – suffer when laws are bad, and so we should stop churning out loads of paper through all the institutions and instead put it to the test by submitting and enacting laws that really are better. That is in our hands as Members of this House. Today, the eighth day of October, sees this House, by means of the Medina Ortega report, making a second attempt at stating its position on a Commission communication on simplified and improved regulation dating back to December 2001, since which date, three summit meetings of Heads of State or Government have given their attention to the issue without Parliament having been in a position to respond and thereby make its influence felt. Producing more paper in this way sets a bad example, when we should, instead, be supporting the Commission in reducing the amount of EU legislation, which now amounts to some 97 000 pages, and in cleaning it all up. That, too, would help the quality of European legislation.

 There have, since 1957, been dramatic developments in the ways in which independent European nation states collaborate with each other. Just as a planet’s gravitational pull captures everything that draws close to it, the courage of six states has resulted in a process of cooperation that has been spreading and becoming more profound right up to the present day. No end to this development is in sight, even though we have started to think about where Europe’s boundaries lie. In business, there is the rule that ‘to stand still is to go backwards’, which, metaphorically speaking, is also true in politics. Thank God we did not stand still as Europe developed politically in the second half of the previous century. All our efforts were and still are rewarded by the reunification of Europe in peace and freedom. Despite many and varied economic problems, Europe still has the power of a planet to attract others, and many fine words have been said about this already today. By means of the Constitutional Treaty, Europe is meant to – indeed it has to – make a qualitative leap if it is to be able to get the better of the challenges that lie ahead. This House was right to denounce the outcomes of Nice for failing to do that, as they were entangled in national egoisms. The Convention was rightly described as ‘constitutional’, for its work shows the way ahead, over and above economic cooperation. It is on this basis that the Member States’ governments can and must show, at the Intergovernmental Conference, whether they are working with the future in mind or are trapped in the behaviour patterns of the past in clinging to national egoisms and national patronage. The present text of the Constitutional Treaty points the way to the future. It should be changed only to improve what already exists. Many of us are concerned that what came out of Nice will not be enough to cope with the imminent enlargement, and that is why – whilst being obliged to the Presidency of the Council for what it has said – I urge the governments to do everything in their power to facilitate the new Treaty’s speedy entry into force, so that not too much time elapses between the governments giving their consent and the Treaty’s final ratification. It is now for you, Europe’s Heads of State or Government, to decide whether you want to take Europe forward or stand in its way for your own egoistic and nationalistic reasons.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if, tomorrow, we adopt this compromise in the form in which the political groups have joined in presenting it, we will have reached the end of a never-ending story, and it is to be hoped that the ending we will give it will be a happy one. It is in fact Parliament that is the heart of the European parties, for it was in Parliament that the need arose to develop commonalities within Europe, and, if you bear in mind that 133 political parties are represented today in this House, united in seven political families, that alone shows how there are no limits to the work done for Europe, in this House, by the political groups, which, in the European Parliament, bring together the states whose political parties are elected to the European Parliament. That is, in itself, unbelievably laborious work, and I believe that we sometimes undervalue it. Why has this been a never-ending story? It was Mr Tsatsos – and let me say that I believe this has been his life’s work – who produced the first report to this House aimed at fostering awareness of how necessary European political parties are. Then we had Amsterdam, which made it possible to get an initiative going, but, as the Council at that time was unable to come to an agreement, Parliament’s report was left high and dry in the Council. I would now like to extend warm thanks to the Commission. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice on 1 February this year, the Commission presented a proposal in the shortest conceivable time; now that we have considered it, I can tell you that they made a very quick job of it. The end result has been that we have not only considered it, but will – it is to be hoped – be finalising it tomorrow. I would like to thank Mr Leinen for his considerable efforts, and I can say on behalf of all of us that, even though we have not got everything we wanted, we still want a solution, and, as I see it, we need one in view of the fact that the Court of Auditors has ended up presenting us with the prospect of having, at the end of this year, to abandon the current practice, which gives the parties stability, and if we do not find a solution, we will then be facing oblivion. That is why, yet again, I would like to ask all those among you who still have doubts, to lend a hand in the completion of a work and in finding an eventual solution, one that is clear and open to scrutiny and, therefore, one that has to work. I would therefore like to thank not only Mr Leinen, but also the Greek Presidency of the Council, which, with all the work it has to do – and there are many other matters to deal with –made a real effort and did everything possible to get the Council to come up with a joint resolution. I do think that we in this House should not only express our appreciation of this, but should also say that it is because everyone has done their bit that we are now coming to a conclusion. In every democratic state the world over, this political order, which secures for the people freedom and co-determination, is founded upon political parties and guaranteed by them. We simply have to see that, as the European Economic Community developed and expanded into the European Union, it was therefore hardly surprising that European political parties should undergo a parallel development. It is for that reason that I am appealing to all those who may perhaps still harbour doubts to play their part in helping us, tomorrow, to achieve a result that will lay a foundation, one on the basis of which political parties can be funded, one that will make the future continuation of this work possible. So, again, I thank all those involved and all those who will, tomorrow, help us to achieve this outcome. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's implementing powers: it all sounds so harmless and yet it conceals a multitude of problems that all of the committees that deal with European legislation have to contend with, and have been doing so for two decades. The Council Decision of 1999 reduced the Babylonian confusion of over 20 variants of such committees in the Commission to three procedures, namely management, regulatory and advisory procedures. The decision also laid down criteria for deciding which committee procedure was appropriate. All of the relevant European Union legislation, consisting of several hundred directives and regulations, had to be brought into line with it. Mrs Frassoni’s report in March 2003 – just a few weeks ago – brought this work to its conclusion. The consequences of our consultations today would be that once again all of the European Union's legislation, that is once again several hundred legal instruments, would have to be brought into line with the new texts. Should the Convention – and here I am talking about Article 202 – propose alternative solutions to the ones that we are discussing today, then this process of adapting all European legislation would have to be repeated. Once again, as with the Lamfalussy procedure, we are only debating an interim solution. This is expressed very clearly in Amendment No 1 of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. In my judgment, the Commission proposal does not enable us to achieve the objectives of transparency and improved legislative supervision of the Commission when it enacts implementing provisions. On the contrary, the proposed changes are designed to remodel Parliament's existing right of supervision as a hearing procedure pure and simple. De facto
 the Commission's proposal amounts to abolishing the management procedure, which also considerably curtails the Council’s and the Member States' influence and supervisory powers. This might well not matter to us in Parliament if our influence and supervisory powers were enhanced accordingly. That is the intention of Parliament's amendments. But the Commission, as Mr Corbett has already said, is refusing to delete an essential word, namely 'possibly'. This means that in the future it may only possibly take into account the substantive demands made by Parliament with regard to the implementing legislation. We cannot support this as a Parliament and are in complete agreement with the rapporteur here.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my voting against the ten accession reports is intended to express my deep concern that the European Union has as yet failed to do as it had promised and enlarge and deepen the EU both at the same time. My confidence in the EU Member States is shattered to its foundations, for not only has their lack of unity in matters of foreign and security policy been demonstrated to Europe's detriment, but, for the same reasons, the Treaty of Nice failed to achieve the conditions required before enlargement can take place. The Convention has not yet produced an outcome, let alone a commitment to the new treaty text being ratified as soon as possible. I regard it as hypocritical to decide on enlargement while the European Union's unresolved problems are swept under the carpet. When this House has such an important decision to take, I would have liked to see more determination to defend its rights in relation to the Council. Lest I be misunderstood, let me say that I am in favour of enlargement, and as soon as possible, even by 1 May 2004, but for that we need a new treaty basis, one that guarantees common action on crucial issues even when there are over 25 Member States. More than ever before, I find a lack of the common European will that is capable of mastering tasks in the strong Europe of tomorrow.

 Mr President, in order to avoid potential misunderstandings, I too want to emphasise that I am in favour of enlargement, by which I mean enlargement as soon as possible. The states that want to join us have undertaken a great endeavour, but the resolutions passed by the European Heads of State and of Government in Copenhagen have needlessly created a grave and extremely difficult situation. Their decision puts them in breach of all the Treaties currently in force and of budgetary law, Parliament's most important prerogative. The Council's actions could be read as a denunciation of the Interinstitutional Agreement in accordance with Article 26. With the serious issues within the European Union relating to enlargement having to be resolved and resolution of those relating to the Treaty of Nice still a long way off, that this should happen is the Council's crowning failure! It baffles me that such a thing is possible when the Council and the Commission have so much expertise at their disposal, unless the intention is to openly provoke Parliament. As we all want enlargement, we are faced with the problem of retrospective damage limitation. When I see, though, how the Council treats treaties and the European Parliament, I have the gravest concerns about what is coming next. Transparency, democratisation, integration and cooperation are empty words if you do the very opposite. At the moment, I do not trust them. As the resolution of this difficult problem will be the subject of ongoing negotiations between Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission even after this decision is adopted, Parliament would be well advised to keep an open mind on all the options for dealing with the accession treaties in April. As I know from personal conversations with them, many Members of this House very much doubt – just as I do – whether, under such conditions, they should give them their approval.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we owe a debt of gratitude to Mr Napolitano for taking on the difficult subject of the role of regional and local bodies in European integration, on which he has shed light in his meticulous and comprehensive report. The many amendments tabled here and in committee testify to the topic's capacity to engage our emotions. Whilst the EU is being enlarged, that process also demands internal integration. People may well move around, but they think of themselves primarily as citizens of their region and of the places where they have their abodes and domiciles, long before they start describing themselves as Italian, English, German, Spanish or even European. This gives these local structures crucial importance when it comes to imparting the tradition of European thought and implementing European legislation in practice and on a day-to-day basis. The fact is, though, that the Member States' constitutional arrangements also differ to an extremely wide degree. Our rapporteur has distinguished himself with the survey he has compiled and included in his working paper on the relationships between the central and local levels in the EU's Member States and in the candidate countries, which reveals that, below the level of a Member State's central government, the regions or federal states possess the most diverse legislative competences. It is not intended that Europe should tamper with this autonomous approach to national structures, which has the deepest of roots in the nation state. Let us not, though, delude ourselves; discussion of this topic brings the Member States, those with centralised constitutions and those constituted on federal lines, with their own conceptions, head to head with each other. This alone explains why so much emotion is called forth by the idea of the regions having an independent right of appeal to the ECJ when their own legislative rights are directly affected. Ladies and gentlemen, it is the European Parliament that, alone, possesses the power to integrate Europe. We, its Members, represent the people for whom ‘home’ means their regions and their communities. If we are now to work on the even greater Europe that we all – for a diversity of reasons – desire, we have to take care to stand on a secure foundation; what we must also give this Europe is a soul – and we must do it with popular consent. Our regions are that foundation, and it is for that reason that we have to treat them with respect rather than passing their concerns through a filter, as Mr Corbett suggested. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us today a wide-ranging revision of the law on medicinal products in Europe. This will have an impact on the competitiveness of companies of all sizes in this sector and accordingly on a great many jobs. However, it also of course affects the entire trade, pharmacists and, last but not least, the patient. This mammoth document is, amongst other things, the result of a new strategy that the Commission has already been pursuing for several years. The volume of Community law, which currently stands at over 80 000 pages, is to be simplified and tightened up. In the case of this particular revision, a single legislative act is to be adopted, taking account of the various substantive changes required and codifying the remaining provisions. The many amendments tabled in committee and now once again in the plenary are just one indication of how difficult this undertaking is. I have enormous respect for the massive amount of work put in by the Commission and by our two rapporteurs, Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller, but I am genuinely concerned that we may to some extent have lost track of the overall picture, so that some apparently less important issues have not perhaps been attended to. That is why I would like to draw your attention to homeopathic medicines, not just for humans but also for animals, and I urge you to support these amendments too. The European Parliament is a co-legislator here and we need to make sure that we do our work carefully. At first reading, we still have a lot of opportunities, but we should also leave the way open for the second reading. That is why I am asking for your support, but I am also calling on the Legal Service and on our rapporteurs to check whether the final outcome is coherent. Only the future can tell whether this pharmaceutical legislation will be easier for the Member States and other stakeholders to apply because of its reduced linguistic complexity. I would like to thank everyone involved and hope that this magnum opus
 will be a success.

As a German and Bavarian Member of the European Parliament, I am sorely disappointed by the outcome of this vote. On behalf of my honourable friends in the CSU, with whom I voted for more stringent limit values, I must say quite emphatically that an opportunity to limit water pollution from recreational craft has been missed for many years to come. Unfortunately, it is our impression that recreational craft engine manufacturers are deliberately holding back on modern engineering – we have an example of this in Switzerland – so as to be able to argue as the rapporteur has done. It should be a cause of concern to anyone who supports motor-boat and sailing sports, knowing that more and more people enjoy these sports and leisure activities, that they are practised in as environmentally-friendly a manner as possible. This dubious outcome in plenary today is certainly nothing to write home about.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we had a three-hour debate on sustainable development. At the World Summit in Johannesburg, the European Union advocated a global water initiative. This should make it possible to realise the aims of the World Summit on Sustainable Development – access to clean drinking water and basic sanitation. So what are we doing, we who want to achieve such ambitious targets at international level, here in our own countries in Europe? We are making a law on abating water pollution that will reinforce the use of yesterday's technology for tomorrow's developments. That, at any rate, will be the result if the opponents of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy succeed in defeating them in plenary. Regrettably they include our rapporteur, who actually ought to represent the opinion of the majority of the committee. Unfortunately, amongst these opponents of advanced technology are also colleagues from groups and countries which are usually in the vanguard of any initiatives to protect water and the environment and cannot go far enough. Go and stand sometime at a filling station in a large harbour for recreational craft; you will see the quantities of fuel, diesel, petrol and oil that are pumped into the tanks of these boats. A considerable proportion of this fuel, although it depends on the design, is discharged directly into the water – without undergoing combustion – along with the exhaust emissions, because the exhaust pipe is under the surface of the water. The pollutants accumulate in inland waters and lakes, which are frequently used for the abstraction of drinking water. Nowhere else is the exchange of pollutants so great. It is precisely on lakes that the density of boats is often particularly high. That is why we want more stringent requirements for these waters, that is, stricter limit values for recreational craft. The technology, Mr Callanan, is available. As an engineer you ought actually to be aware of this. Since existing craft will enjoy absolute protection and be able to be used until the end of their life, the argument of our Nordic colleagues does not hold water either. The limit values laid down now will only have to be complied with by boats newly brought onto the market from 2005. An individual who buys a new recreational craft after 2005 will be able to use it on all waters. That is why I would urgently request your support for Amendments Nos 1, 11 and 13. By adopting these amendments we Europeans would be putting our words in Johannesburg into action. Mr Callanan, I have already heard your arguments almost word for word here in plenary; it was nearly 20 years ago in the mid-eighties, in the last century, when we were debating limit values for cars and the introduction of new technology. Then, as now, your country was the first to slam on the brakes. It is quite astonishing that in two decades you have not learnt any better. I believe that water is also the life of the future. We must do all we can to prevent our waters from becoming even more polluted.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is all too true that the procedure for direct elections to the European Parliament has been an almost interminable business since the seventies. Sensible solutions keep getting tangled up in the institutional undergrowth. Parliament may well have the right of initiative under the European Treaties, but it is the Council that must come to a decision – a unanimous one. As long as four years ago, we discharged our obligations with the Anastassopulos report, but the Council of Ministers has taken a very, very long time to do something about its own. Now it has managed to come up with something, we are glad that we at last have a uniform electoral system in time for the 2004 elections, but I must warmly thank Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado for having raised the matters that Parliament has so long called for, but which have unfortunately not been taken up. Thus, there is nothing left to us other than to accept or reject the Council proposals; in other words, it is a case of ‘sink or swim’. Even though we have to admit that a number of points have been taken on board, matters are as unsatisfactory as ever they were. This report adds Parliament to the roll of those who have called on the Convention to revise the provisions on EU election law in the Treaty establishing the European Communities. According to the treaties, Parliament has the right of initiating electoral legislation, and it is not acceptable that it no longer has a part in reaching final decisions. Matters of such fundamental importance to Parliament require that Parliament be given the full right of codecision. I can hardly resist saying that the proposed wording concerning the introduction of territorial constituencies, with the protocol on the subject, brings the thorny issue of Great Britain and Gibraltar nearer to a solution. It is indeed sad that a country like Great Britain, with centuries of experience of Empire and a centuries-old tradition of democracy needs a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights to remind it of its greater responsibilities beyond the bounds of its own territory. This solution means that the citizens of Gibraltar will at last be able to participate in elections to the European Parliament. This is certainly a success for democracy in Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the cultural diversity of Europe is reflected in, among other things, the political systems of the Member States. Taking responsibility in Europe means mutual recognition of the Member States' constitutional arrangements, which are many and varied. I am from a Member State with a federal constitution and see this as a great advantage, especially in terms of the greater proximity of politics to the citizen. This makes me particularly grateful to our rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, for taking up the topic of the regions, especially of those that possess legislative powers. Some of these regions are larger, in terms of surface area and population, than the small Member States. This disparity in political arrangements will be made greater by the accession of more Member States. Item 34 and the compromise set out in item 39 are very important, as they highlight a new way of having recourse to law in disputes concerning subsidiarity and the principle of proportionality. Let me draw my colleagues' attention to one thing, namely that, in its judgment dated 3 May 2002 in the Jégo Quéré case, the European Court of First Instance declared itself to be a constitutional court. The clear delimitation of competences is of the greatest significance as regards the public's consent to further internal integration and to enlargement. What Europe's citizens want is for the Convention, when working out its proposals for a European constitutional treaty, to be guided by transparently clarifying the tasks to be performed by the EU and by the Member States respectively. The latest Eurobarometer surveys indicate that 60% of the EU's citizens take pride in describing themselves as Europeans, and that two-thirds of the current population of the EU – as many as 80% in Italy – want a European constitution. Mr Lamassoure's fine report is an important contribution by Parliament to the arduous process of attaining that goal. So, I thank everybody and hope that we will be successful in the Convention!

 I wish to emphasise at the outset that I am unreservedly in favour of Parliament working in a transparent manner and also of all its documentation being made accessible to the public. I nonetheless voted against Mrs Maij-Weggen's report. Parliament has a political task, and, in the conciliation procedure between the Council and Parliament deals with political questions – sometimes sensitive ones – and the work of the delegations can even touch on live political issues. I consider it irresponsible for us to make ‘working documents’ accessible to the public. Official documents and working documents are quite different things. The conciliation procedure in particular deals with the political implementation of different positions taken by the two institutions, Parliament and the Council. If all the thinking set down in the working documents is made public at the outset, then we can give up politics. The Council will be delighted to know in advance what Parliament has in mind.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Rules of Procedure do not allow further proposals for the topical and urgent debate to be tabled at short notice. Our delegation for cooperation with Georgia was in Georgia last week. Since local government elections are taking place there on 2 June, we have enquired as to whether these elections are being conducted correctly. We have learned that two parties have already been denied permission to take part in the elections, and we have also learned just now that a further party, namely that of the former president of the Parliament who left the Shevardnadze Party to found a new one, is also not being allowed to participate in the elections. We should simply like to state the fact openly here and then, naturally, discuss the matter with the Commission and the Council. We consider this a matter of great urgency, even though our May part-session does not allow any more urgency debates, for the local elections will already be over in June. We are of the view that a reminder needs to be given about this. We should like, however, to be given still more precise information by the Council and the Commission, for we are extremely concerned that elections are being held but are not being conducted democratically. We should like to support Georgia’s cause, but the bottom line is that democracy must prevail there. I should like to have this recorded in the Minutes.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the previous speaker, who thinks that too few measures have been taken, I have to say that, as a Member and as vice-chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the measures proposed by national governments give me great cause for concern. In the areas mentioned, the European Council is formulating objectives that in some cases are clearly cutting across the competence of Member States. Even if open coordination is not specifically mentioned as a particularly suitable policy tool for these areas of policy, that cannot disguise the fact that the procedure that will continue to apply is that based on objectives and guidelines whose implementation by the Member States is subject to scrutiny at European level. The end result is open coordination. This procedure is highly undemocratic. Neither the European Parliament nor national parliaments are involved in it. It amounts to a violation of the relevant treaties. However, it is also an affront to the objective formulated by the governments in Laeken in December 2001 for the next intergovernmental conference and the most important theme of the convention, that is to say the dividing line in competence as between the EU and Member States. What has become apparent from a constitutional point of view is the statement by the Barcelona Council that there should be a simplification of the process for the European Employment Strategy, and that in particular the number of employment policy guidelines should be reduced. So who initiated this process? It would be very difficult to demonstrate the need for a distinct division of competences more clearly. All I can do is to call on the Heads of State and Government to respect the competences laid down in the relevant treaties and not to arrogate rights to themselves that are found neither in national constitutions nor in the European treaties. The Council's exhortation to Member States to introduce more flexible working arrangements at national level will undoubtedly have a greater impact than utopian European targets and guidelines. The Heads of State and Government should avoid not only the inflation of targets, but also an inflation of Councils, and should concentrate on realistic tasks for the European Union which are covered by the treaties.

Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the 1991 directive on urban waste water is intended to guarantee the construction and maintenance of sewage-treatment works in all large towns and municipalities of the European Union. Since these measures involve considerable financial expenditure, very liberal implementation deadlines were set. As my honourable colleague Mrs Sornosa Martínez has said, we must conclude today that not all Member States have made use of the time at their disposal; on the contrary, they have engaged in delaying tactics and – regrettably, in view of their failure to submit reports, we must also say quite bluntly – in obfuscation. The Belgian metropolis of Brussels, which is so keen to call itself the capital of Europe, sets an appalling example in this respect. The fine report compiled by Mrs Sornosa Martínez mercilessly exposes the inadequacies. Most Member States have not even fulfilled their reporting obligations for the first date in 1998, let alone for the second date in 2000. That is bad enough. What is far worse, however, is that the Member States’ waters continue to be polluted by untreated municipal sewage. We are addressing many demands to the Commission today. It cannot act, however, as long as it does not have the power to do so. I believe that the large number of default actions and legal proceedings instituted before the European Court of Justice proves that the Commission is doing its duty. It is unquestionably the Member States that are in the dock. As Members of Parliament, we too should take action in our own countries. The call for wider direct powers of on-the-spot scrutiny for the Commission in the Member States, enabling it to intervene in the same way that it can already intervene in the realm of agriculture, is vehemently rejected by most of the Member States. Be that as it may, if we identify such gross violations by national governments of their obligations to implement European legislation, we must also find out why this is happening. I should like to mention at least three reasons. The first is the high cost, to which the European Parliament has drawn attention time and again since the directive was first debated. It is estimated that an eleven-figure sum in euros is needed for investments alone in the 15 Member States. Current estimates also put the cost of implementing this one directive in the applicant countries at about EUR 30 billion. The second reason is that many directives require the Member States to submit reports, which considerably increases their administrative workload. I urge the Commission to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether this task cannot be simplified, perhaps by means of standardised returns. Some initial moves have already been made in this direction, of course, within this very domain of activity in connection with the various directives for the protection of water resources. The third reason is that those Member States which have transposed the directive have gone about the designation of sensitive areas in very different ways. Should the Commission not spell out the precise criteria for the designation of sensitive areas? That might perhaps make the directive easier to implement as well as having the desirable side-effect of enhanced comparability. I should be grateful if the Commissioner could respond to these points too.

Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our delegation to the EU-Armenia, EU-Azerbaijan and EU-Georgia Parliamentary Cooperation Committees is most grateful to the Committee on Foreign Affairs for enabling us, with Mr Gahrton's report, to focus in more detail on the South Caucasus region in this debate today. This region on Europe's periphery draws on a wealth of cultural and Christian traditions. It is Europe's gateway to Asia. With the troika initiative and the visit to South Caucasus, the European Union has sent out encouraging signals, but things are moving far too slowly. What is especially alarming, as far as south-east Europe is concerned, is that Russia suspects that al-Qaeda fighters may have taken refuge in Georgia and has announced that it will expand its action throughout Georgia. Georgia, on the other hand, is hoping for support from the US, which is already responding. But where does this leave Europe? We have already discussed the aftermath of 11 September in the European Parliament in Strasbourg and expressed concerns about the difficulties which might arise if the situation in the region escalates. Unfortunately, it seems that our concerns are justified, for events have now taken a truly dramatic turn. In recent centuries, South Caucasus has constantly been riven by conflict. Surely, in 2002, it must be possible to stabilise these regions at last and give the people there a future and the chance to live their lives in peace and with some measure of lasting prosperity in their home territories. All three countries are striving to establish democratic structures and assert their independence from their over-mighty neighbours. Yet if we consider that Russian troops are still present in two of these countries, and that while Azerbaijan has been liberated, one third of its territory is effectively out-of-bounds across Armenia, these are issues which are not only of concern to the local population, but could also unleash a new wave of aggression. I therefore address my comments to the Commissioner in particular: oil could undoubtedly become a key issue here, and I wish that as well as America and Russia asserting their interests, the Europeans – in the countries which still count as Europe – would not only take action but would also ensure that stable development takes place in these countries. After all, they are trying to establish democracies, but it is a difficult process. If corruption and crime gain the upper hand here, life for ordinary people will become intolerable. I think that as Europeans, we face an enormous task: to respond as quickly as we can and do our utmost to play a positive role in this conflict in order to give these countries a future. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the democratic deficit in Europe is being presented as the main problem. It is an unfortunate fact that the competences ceded by the national parliaments to Europe have not all as yet arrived at the European Parliament, the only European institution to be legitimised by elections. Responsibility for this must be borne by all the Member States that have to date refused to pass on these competences to the co-legislator, Parliament, in the form of codecision in the legislative sphere. The governments have thus gained for themselves at European level legislative and executive powers that would have been inconceivable in their national legal system. That is the real scandal of the democratic deficit in Europe. Are we then to commend the Heads of State and Government for, at the Nice Summit, setting out relations between the European Parliament and the national parliaments as being one of the four topics for the forthcoming Convention and the new Intergovernmental Conference? That would be to put off the governments' lack of capacity and willingness for yet another day. This is the fundamental misunderstanding that Mr Berthu has described in his minority opinion. Parliament must indeed seek to stand shoulder to shoulder with the national parliaments in order together to compel the governments to act in a democratic way. Parliament's two great groups are very much as one in this demand, and I am grateful to our group's Mr Gil Robles for his contribution to the Napolitano report, and to our rapporteur for his Amendment No 21. These show the right way ahead into the future. That which is feasible and appropriate must be done at every level. The national parliaments can and must monitor their national governments better and more effectively than before. We wish to encourage them to do so, both as regards the governments' conduct when European legislation is drafted in Council and in terms of the financial management and monitoring of funds granted by the EU. The European Parliament must monitor legislation at European level and play a part in shaping it. In conclusion, I can only say that we are grateful for the report and hope that it will also be taken seriously by the Convention. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Belgian Presidency has without doubt gone to a great deal of effort, yet the lack of a European Community spirit on the part of the fifteen governments in the European Union when it comes to important and urgent decisions is something that cannot be overcome by just one Presidency. The brilliant analysis of the situation and the many questions listed could have come from Parliament's reports on Nice, its aftermath, or Laeken, and they give the impression of having been written down on the spot. These are questions to which Parliament has for years now been demanding answers for the sake of the future of the European Union. Is everything now again being jeopardised by so much questioning? Let us take, for example, common suffrage. The Council has, since July 1998, been examining a European draft electoral law on elections to the European Parliament and has still not come to any conclusion by the end of 2001 – all of two and a half years later. It is raising the question of whether we want European suffrage. Looked at as a whole, there is no doubt that the Convention represents an opportunity, yet Parliament contradicts Laeken by demanding that we should negotiate and reach a decision on the basis of one unitary, coherent proposal. It is equally regrettable that the Heads of State and of Government have again put off until Barcelona and Seville resolutions on the adaptation of the Council's structures and work practices. Reading the Laeken resolutions reminded me of a saying coined by one of our poets, Hans Magnus Enzensberger: ‘He, seated in a common place, / thought up another commonplace.’

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the delegation for relations with the South Caucasus, I would like to inform you that a member of the Commission's diplomatic staff has been the victim of an insidious murder in Georgia. I wish to ask the President, on behalf of the European Parliament, to send a communication to President Shevardnaze calling upon him not only to do everything in his power to solve this crime, but also to make sure at long last that constitutional means are used to ensure that people who work in Georgia and for Georgia are guaranteed appropriate protection, so that this essential work can be done effectively. I regard this incident as a very serious one. We want to do everything to help the South Caucasus, but the South Caucasus itself must also make efforts to protect people entrusted to its care.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the European Community's programme of action in the field of public health for 2001-2006. As we will, I think, probably end up going into the conciliation procedure, the programme will probably not become effective before early 2002 and its term will be delayed accordingly. The European Commission had allocated EUR 300 million for all the European Union's health projects over five years. I feel provoked by the way the Council of Ministers has again cut this amount and is willing to authorise only EUR 280 million. This programme set itself the extensive goals of continuing the eight existing action programmes, and there are additional tasks, considered to be urgent, especially in the area of information and, as Mr Trakatellis has already mentioned, in that of the challenges posed by international terrorism, whose scale we can as yet scarcely grasp. That being so, I cannot do other than give my full, whole-hearted support to Parliament's demand for EUR 380 million; indeed, I consider that the very least that the European Community must make available. We must not be amenable to compromise on this, and the Council must not be left under any misapprehension about this. The common position on the other areas, however, is in my view a great improvement on what the Commission originally submitted and on the documents produced by the first reading in Parliament. The great majority of the amendments that have now been resubmitted, and to which the Environment Committee has agreed, I do not see as an improvement in absolutely every respect. Despite the difficulties I have with them, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Trakatellis for the work he has done and, in particular, for his efforts at achieving a broad consensus in Parliament. I must say, though, that further and continuing education is certainly a good start across national boundaries, but I have great difficulty with training in healthcare, medicine, and so on, becoming a matter for the European Community. I see it as a matter for the Member States. Some Members have expressed doubt about everything having to be done at a European level. Coming as I do from a large Member State, I have seen only that the centralised allocation of tasks does not necessarily represent an improvement, but that individuals must really be helped where they actually are, and that, I believe, is done better by the Member States.

 I welcome the good work done by the rapporteurs and I therefore also voted in favour of the report. But I do object that a problem with the terms ‘constitution’ and ‘constitutional treaty’ has arisen for a second time in connection with this subject. When the vote was taken in plenum on the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro Report on the Treaty of Nice and the future of the Union on 31 May 2001, an official corrigendum to the protocol had to be submitted with the correct text ‘constitutional treaty’. The same problem arose in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs when voting on the Leinen/Méndez de Vigo Report on the Laeken European Council and the future of the European Union on 22 October 2001 in Strasbourg because of differences between the voting documents – the compromise amendments were only available in English and French – and despite my intervention it was not subsequently resolved by a linguistic correction. I ask Parliament's Bureau to look into this.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no democracy without a Parliament. Today again we find that the European Parliament is the principal integrating element in the European Union. Nowhere else do Council, Commission and Parliament engage in public discussion, not always achieving unanimity, but openly, and, I hope, constructively. Our three rapporteurs have presented excellent reports. This Parliament has, since Nice, been pressing forward with a Community process which must burst forth in Laeken. I share President Prodi's concern that the European Union is not yet adequately equipped to cope with enlargement, and so I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to check again, and check carefully, whether what was decided in Nice really does enhance the working capacity of the Council and of Parliament. I doubt it. The European Community and European Union have developed splendidly over the past nearly fifty years to date, and I hope that the next fifty years will be prepared for in such a way that we can work even better in the European Union over the next fifty years.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication from the Commission shows that they are giving thought to how to put into practice the requirements of the water framework directive, and Mrs Flemming's report makes valuable additional suggestions. Average household water consumption varies, per person per day, between 120 litres in Belgium and 213 litres in Italy. Germany, with DM 7.72 per cubic metre for the supply of drinking water and for wastewater drainage, is, with Denmark, far and away at the top of the world league, but, as regards consumption, is third from the bottom. Adequate high-quality water supply and appropriate drainage are part, of course, of services of general interest in the broadest sense, such as we have been discussing this morning. We must not, though, make the mistake of lumping deregulation and privatisation together. Privatisation can, in conjunction with other means, be perfectly adequate in achieving the objectives set by Article 9 of the water framework directive. I would, though, at this point, like – in the context of the discussion on the subject-matter for the new Inter-Governmental Conference – to give a clear reminder of the topic of the demarcation of competencies. We should not be making the sensitive area of water supply and drainage even more unstable while this issue has not been satisfactorily resolved. The various aspects of water and the price paid for it are among the most politically sensitive issues in some Member States, not only the southern ones, but also for Ireland and Austria, for example. I would wish to emphatically warn against mentioning or even attacking individual Member States. This applies all the more in view of the attempt, for example in item 28 for obvious reasons of party politics, to realise demands at a European level which would not be feasible in terms of domestic policy. Additionally in this case, the issues addressed are, then, only very marginally concerned, if at all, with the subject of the report. We would be creating a precedent with unforeseeable consequences, and I urge the adoption of Amendments Nos 3 and 6, for otherwise we would have to vote against an otherwise very good report.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, due to the tragic events of recent months, foreign and security policy is currently at the top of the public's agenda. In the light of the events in the Middle East and America, it is easy to forget that the situation in the Caucasus is just as explosive. The problems faced by Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan – including the relations between these three states – still give cause for concern. Political instability repeatedly threatens the still incomplete independence process. As a result, violent conflict within these countries is often the focus of public attention. Yet the history of Europe – especially the history of the European Union – shows that despite the differences and conflicts of interest between states, it is possible to form alliances and thus transcend borders. Where war once dominated the scenario, we now have peaceful and democratic co-existence. It is based on the establishment of democratic structures and an emphasis on commonalities, which helped the Western European states to overcome their differences. In the light of the global coalition against terrorism in all its forms which has emerged since the dreadful attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001, there is thus a need to support the states of the Southern Caucasus in their efforts to combat terror and violence which, sadly, are still a feature of daily life in these countries and threaten many people's lives every day. The region's democratic structures are still quite new and fragile. The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that disunity is incited from outside, and the neighbouring states in this region could try to impede or halt the democratisation process for their own interests. For these reasons, one of the European Union's key tasks must be to give more support to the democratisation process in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Democracy is the only basis for lasting internal stability which in future will also transcend borders. However, the European Union and the present Belgian Presidency should focus solely on providing assistance and support; under no circumstances should they intervene in these countries' internal affairs. In specific terms, this means promoting these states' cooperation and cohesion, also as regards the possibility of a free trade area which must be set up without external influence. The initial elements of trilateral cooperation are already in place; however, they must be expanded and supported in order to counter existing external influences successfully. If these countries' shared rich cultural heritage is integrated into this process, I am confident that in the medium and long term, important results and successes can be achieved. As Chairman of the European Parliament's Southern Caucasus delegation, I regard the EU Ministerial Troika's visit under the Swedish Presidency last February as the basis for necessary initiatives. The joint motion for a resolution tabled by seven parliamentary groups signals the broad agreement between Members of the European Parliament on this issue. I hope that the Commission, too, will make our concern its own.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two rapporteurs, Iñigo Méndez de Vigo and António José Seguro, took on the difficult task of evaluating the results of the Nice Government Summit in December 2000 without hurting anyone while at the same time setting our sights for the future and expressing the hopes and demands of the European Parliament. They deserve our sincere thanks. Political closeness to the governments in the home countries obviously plays some part in the evaluation of the results of Nice. Whether the practice of appointing two rapporteurs from different groups will still be meaningful for the European Parliament in the future needs to be looked at carefully. As Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I should have liked the language to have been clearer. I know that large parts of the PPE-DE Group and not only my German colleagues agree with me. In our view, the results of Nice are not sufficient to create the institutional conditions for enlargement. We regret that precisely because we want enlargement and want it as quickly as possible. We have reservations in particular about the complicated voting procedure in the Council of Ministers, but also about the number of MPs and the composition of the European Parliament; that this should not be settled until 2009 is completely unsatisfactory, will create legal problems in the meantime, create injustices for some candidate countries and also cement the continuing democratic deficit because it fails to link the codecision process to majority voting in the Council of Ministers. Nice set out four topics for the new Intergovernmental Conference, of which the definition of competences is of the utmost importance for us and must be settled before the first accessions. Unfortunately, the draft repeatedly speaks of a constitution. I want to argue here for the clear legal concept of a constitutional treaty. Lastly and most important of all: the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference must not only be prepared for more carefully, it must be over by the end of 2003, and that means that the way must be definitively paved in the form of the convention, timetable and content by the time of the European Council in Laeken at the end of 2001 at the latest.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is regrettable that a number of meetings are taking place at the same time as this debate, despite the fact that this is an issue which actually concerns the whole Parliament. Parties are the foundation stone of democracies. Without parties, which ideally fight to establish a model which maximises the welfare of state and society, democracy is inconceivable. Today, all 15 Member States of the European Union are ruled by democratic forms of state, and therefore by governments composed of varying combinations of political parties. As citizens of democratically governed Member States we are right to attach importance to them; as Europeans we can rightly be proud of them. Many people ask whether we need a statute for European parties. The European Parliament is the only institution of the European Union which is legitimated by direct, free elections. The European Parliament is also regarded as the cradle of European parties. Cooperation in the groups required there to be increasingly close contacts between their constituent parties and with the national parties. In this way, new international party structures and European parties gradually developed. I should simply like to refer to the fact that the European People's Party has been in existence since 1976, the Party of European Socialists since 1992, the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party since 1993 and finally the European Federation of Green Parties also since 1993. If my information is correct, two more European parties have apparently been founded since then, which means that we already have at least six European parties now. The party political landscape is hardly uncomplicated. The number of parties represented in national parliaments varies considerably across the Member States. Our 626 Members of the European Parliament, at any rate, hail from 130 different national parties. Italy, with 21 parties in the European Parliament, is represented by the greatest number of parties. These different national parties have combined in the European Parliament to form eight groups, alongside the 14 non-attached Members. In response to these various developments, Parliament has been calling for a legal base for European parties since the eighties. The adoption of the Treaty of Maastricht ten years ago brought a breakthrough for the European Parliament in the shape of Article 191, which was adopted unanimously by the governments of the Member States. This article reads: "Political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union. They contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union." In the Treaty of Nice, Article 191 is amplified to turn that article, on its own, into a legal base. "The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251, shall lay down the regulations governing political parties at European level and in particular the rules regarding their funding." European parties therefore make a valuable contribution to European integration, which should not be underestimated. This work cannot be done by a national party. To continue this work, European parties need, for example, office space and employees, which means, in other words, money. Up until now the European parties have been supported by their groups in the European Parliament. However, it is precisely this indirect funding by the groups which the European Court of Auditors has criticised on the grounds of lack of transparency and the improper use of parliamentary funds, and it will not tolerate this any longer. The European Union budget already provides funds for the current financial year in line B3-500: EUR 7 million for all parties. This is certainly no cornucopia, as we hear from resentful quarters. How the funds are to be distributed is also laid down in the Regulation. The Commission generously tabled a proposal for a regulation in February to establish the conditions which would need to be met. One of these is for statutes to be submitted, providing evidence that a European party is committed to the principles of democracy, respect for fundamental rights and control of income and expenditure, which are enshrined in the Treaty on European Union. This goes further than existing national legislation on parties. In addition, a European party has to prove, amongst other things, that it has been successful in elections in at least five Member States or that it is represented in the European Parliament by Members from at least five Member States. There are also precise rules on how the Regulation is to be implemented and on control. The European parties are not permitted to use their funds to finance national parties. This ban also applies to the funding of election campaigns. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has added several points in its opinion, including the reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a definition of the party as having legal personality so that it can conduct legal transactions, and further-reaching proposals on controls, including on revenue from donations. Thanks are also due here to the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for their good proposals. In addition there are now a further 40 amendments, which I should like to classify under three headings: those which make the text of the Regulation more precise, those which propose detailed rules and those which reject the proposal. You will understand that, as rapporteur, I cannot support the proposal's rejection because, after all, it is Parliament itself which has been calling for a regulation for a long time. There is another reason why rejection is also incomprehensible to me. It arouses suspicion that we want to prevent party financing being made transparent at European level. I cannot recommend detailed rules at present. This Regulation is a temporary solution until the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, when we will be in a position to draft comprehensive legislation with the Council. Today we are taking the first step and until the Council makes a unanimous decision we can unfortunately only deliver an opinion. It is in the interests of the European Parliament for a neat solution to be found which will enable the criticisms of the European Court of Auditors to be taken into account as quickly as possible. I should like to address one more point: the Council was present yesterday, and I received the speech of the President-in-Office on behalf of the Council Presidency. I should very much like to hand it over to the President of Parliament. In it the Council says that it is interested in our completing our work as early as today if possible. The Council is full of good intentions to do all it can to bring this dossier to a conclusion, possibly even under the Swedish Presidency. I should therefore like to thank the Swedish Presidency for showing such commitment in its efforts to allow the European parties to stand on their own two feet, by conferring legal status on them and making their funding transparent. This is a very difficult task which, in the interests of democracy, will hopefully be crowned with success. I hereby hand this speech over to the President of Parliament. (Applause)

Mr President, as a result of our work today, the Water Framework Directive, which entered into force in December 2000, will be fleshed out with the listing of 32 specific substances in Annex X. The Group of the European Peoples’ Party is in agreement with the proposal from the Commission. All the amendments supported by our group help to bring the text of the annex into line with that of the Water Framework Directive. The rapid adoption of this list is a matter of priority for our group, because only then will the Commission be able to get down to its main task of formulating proposals for the treatment of every single one of these 32 substances. This can then mean banning substances and phasing them out or permitting their continued use, subject to certain conditions. The aim, however, is always the same, namely either not to let these substances enter water at all in future or only to let them enter water in weak concentrations. The concept of water in the context of the directive covers all water – groundwater, surface water, rivers and lakes, right down to the smallest stream and even perhaps the smallest puddle, and, of course, the sea. It goes without saying that this wide range of aquatic environments will require widely differing sets of rules. After all, we are not starting from scratch here in Europe, because many of these 32 substances are already covered by the Directive on plant-protection products, the Biocides Directive and the Directive on existing substances. Moreover, when the entire body of EU legislation on chemical substances is realigned, we shall be compelled to subject all these substances to thorough scrutiny once again. For this reason we should take great care to ensure that there is no duplication of effort, and hence unnecessary expense. We can spend the money more fruitfully elsewhere for the benefit of the environment. Our aim here is to determine the impact of these substances on our water resources. We have learned that the Swedish Presidency is keen to have this matter concluded swiftly. We intend to support its pursuit of that goal. Our group will not stand in its way. Anyone who is seriously committed to the protection of our European waters should adopt the same position. Mrs Breyer has already stressed a point that I should like to re-emphasise, namely that Parliament has achieved a resounding success in the creation of the Water Framework Directive and that its fruits are already being harvested today. After all, its classification of eleven substances out of the 32 as priority hazardous substances has ensured that their discharge into water resources will be stopped within the foreseeable future. But I also wish to thank the Commission for its painstaking work and for the comprehensive information which it has provided and which has been of great assistance to me in my role as shadow rapporteur. My thanks are also due to our rapporteur, Mrs Breyer, for all her efforts.

I voted against the Trakatellis report, my reasons, which also apply to my fellow CSU members from Bavaria, being as follows: the European Community is still not responsible for health policy and can therefore only coordinate. Parliament calls in its text for a "Health Coordination and Monitoring Centre" (HCMC) to be set up, operated and extended. We vehemently rejected this because this is a matter for the Member States. In addition, there is a series of calls which go against the principle of subsidiarity, such as recommendations for school education programmes, quality standards applicable to health and training and further training. The text adopted by Parliament also contains no specification that the limited funds available should be used in a sensible and targeted manner.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal for a Public Health Action Programme for 2001-2006 is a well-meaning attempt to overcome the current fragmentation of European health policy into numerous individual programmes. Our colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have made every effort to incorporate many additional issues into the Commission's text and improve upon it, while our rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, has made genuine efforts and worked extremely hard to take all these different wishes into account. This has not only resulted in a great many proposed amendments; in my view, it also presents us with a text which – as an opinion of the European Parliament – is useless in its current form. It is full of repetition, tautology, rambling paragraphs, contradictory statements, and demands which violate the principle of subsidiary, even though the opposite is claimed in the text. In terms of content, I have concerns about the Commission's priorities as reflected, inter alia
, in the allocation of resources. Here, I support the rapporteur's proposed amendment. But in particular, I have grave reservations about the undoubtedly well-meaning proposal calling on the Commission to set up a Health Coordination and Monitoring Centre (HCMC) to ensure the efficient operation and coordination of the programme. I will vote against all these proposed amendments, and also protest vigorously about the fact that we are discussing this report in plenary this week even though the translation was only available on Monday. A framework programme could create the necessary transparency for the Community's activities in the field of health and offer the flexibility to set priorities in response to current events. In this way, the limited available resources could be used sensibly and in a targeted way. But this requires a clear and lucid mandate for the Commission, which – in my view – the current text fails to provide.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament's delegation for relations with the South Caucasus is deeply concerned about the dramatic events currently being enacted there. The unilateral imposition of a visa regime on Georgia, with the exception of two regions of Georgia, will create new divisions in a country which is a member of the Council of Europe, wishes to develop democratically, and with which we have concluded an agreement precisely in order to support it in all areas. These developments are leading to tensions with neighbouring states and to huge obstacles for the Georgians themselves, some of whom work in the Russian Federation and are now experiencing difficulties. In order to obtain a visa, they have to travel back to Tiflis. In some cases they cannot even afford to do this. And the other side is that these disruptions will also have economic consequences. We are very much concerned that because of its oil reserves the entire South Caucasus is now at the mercy of commercial interests and has also become a European trouble spot. We should not just wring our hands about this, we should actually do everything in our power. We know from our Georgian friends in national parliaments and from the embassy, which has contacted us, that they really are in dire straits, and that they fear further developments, especially as a wedge is being driven between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which Moscow evidently regards as greater friends. Georgia fears that it will become isolated. So these are truly dramatic events. At the end of December, gas pipelines from Russia to Georgia were even blocked on the alleged grounds that payments had not been made, even though the financing arrangements were quite different. So these are all things which when explained logically sound quite harmless, but which demonstrate to us that the situation has dramatically intensified over the last six months. We are therefore asking the Commission to consider, in conjunction with the Council, whether we could not review and work out a better approach to these conflict situations, based on appropriate decisions which will help people there who want to build a democratic society and seek a peaceful future, and to support Georgia in observing human rights and complying with the other obligations it has entered into within the Council of Europe. It is very hard in these difficult circumstances for Georgia to observe all its current human rights obligations. That is why we are calling on the Commission to act here. We have made requests and have largely reached cross-party agreement in Parliament that something should be done. We need to work together to come up with solutions which will promote a peaceful way forward.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Jackson's question illustrates the fact that the best laws in the world are no use whatsoever unless they are applied correctly and, more importantly, properly controlled. For example, the Member States have not transposed the habitats directive into national legislation. The same applies to a great deal of other legislation. And this is legislation which we need for the future. The Commission is responsible for transposition and for checking what sort of on-site controls have been carried out. In doing so it, in turn, must rely on information supplied to it by the Member States. I get the impression that monitoring is no easy task and if the Commission is to perform this task it needs information and data and reports to be sent in. The complaint was often voiced in the past that the Commission did not have enough staff and resources to evaluate the data sent in for control purposes. I should therefore like to ask the Commission if it now has sufficient resources. Mind you, Parliament cannot talk, because we are constantly calling for reports. I know that the Commission is very busy receiving and processing reports and that this sometimes ties up Commission capacities and resources unnecessarily. In other words, we all have to think where we can make improvements. I think the Commission should react more quickly, both towards the Member States and in instituting the necessary proceedings before the ECJ and setting fines. At the same time, I call on the Member States to honour their obligations to transpose and control legislation and report to the Commission properly. I am the person responsible in our group for the water framework directive and the rapporteur for the groundwater action programme, which is still pending, and the nitrates directive is therefore a matter of particular concern to me. On Tuesday, i.e. tomorrow, we shall be voting on the Goodwill report, to which I have proposed a number of amendments. I should like to ask the House to accept these proposed amendments, because what we are trying to do here is to give the Member States more responsibility. I should therefore be grateful for your support. Finally, I should like to mention one more point, namely the candidate countries. We require candidate countries to adopt European legislation. But when the Member States themselves fail to abide by it and the European Commission is unable to take decisive action, then everything starts to go pear-shaped. For this reason alone and, most importantly, in order to protect human health and the environment, all those responsible need to radically rethink the matter post-haste and these reports make that clear.

Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a deplorable state of affairs at the European School I in Brussels. Thousands of children and young people – most of whom are the offspring of our officials – have not had any lessons since the end of June. They have, as yet, been unable to start the first term of the new school year. It was originally scheduled for 7 September. Several days previous to that, it was postponed until today, and now the parents have been informed once again that the term cannot begin because some major building work has yet to be completed. The renovation work has been going on for years at this school, and the asbestos problems are a familiar tale too. Yet no alternative arrangements were made for the children. I urge the President of our Parliament, in conjunction with the Commission, to ensure that this disgraceful state of affairs is not resolved at the children’s expense. I cannot believe what is going on! School attendance is compulsory and yet the children are unable to fulfil this requirement.

 Mr President, with the outcome of the conciliation concerning the Water Framework Directive, we are completing what, for the European Parliament, has been a tough but successful piece of work lasting ten years. At the same time, however, we are, as a result, standing on the threshold of new tasks that are at least as important. Since the end of the 1980s, a range of Commission proposals had been submitted to the House, aimed at revising existing directives and made necessary by scientific and technical developments. When those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy initially examined the proposals, we found that no effort had been made to coordinate their provisions or the concepts behind them. In June 1995, and at our group’s insistence, the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy held a hearing of experts on the European Union’s water policy. The experts’ statements confirmed our concerns. The Council and the Commission complied with the call for comprehensive European water protection legislation to be drawn up. The idea of the current Water Framework Directive was born at that time. In February 1996, the European Commission tabled its proposals in the form of a communication. In a very comprehensive report, our fellow PPE-DE Group member, Mr Florenz, has clarified the European Parliament’s aims and identified the current shortcomings. In the light of the discussions between the Commission and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Commission proposal of December 1996, which had been produced under great pressure of time, was supplemented in two stages in 1997. The definitive, official Commission proposal was finally ready in February 1998. By working together closely in this way, Parliament and the European Commission gradually moved towards a consensus, a process also helped by the intensive discussions during the first and second readings in the European Parliament and the conciliation procedure. I should particularly like to thank the Commissioners responsible, Mrs Bjerregaard and Mrs Wallström, and especially the Commission officials involved, for this constructive cooperation. In Parliament’s view, the result we now have before us is a great success of a kind which would still have been unthinkable two years ago. This success is reflected in the removal from the statute books of the hitherto fragmented EU legislation in the field of water protection, the coherence of the relevant water directives at EU level, the legally binding nature of the measures taken pursuant to Article 4, the shortening of the deadline for complying with the aims of the directive, the satisfactory way in which the issue of costs has been settled, also in accordance with Ireland’s wishes, the introduction of the combined approach whereby limit values and quality objectives are established with a view to reducing the levels of pollutants, significant improvements over the common position regarding the requirements for groundwater protection and, finally, the inclusion of the goal and the definition of the OSPAR Convention with no stipulations in terms of time. I should like once again to make explicitly clear in this connection the particular importance we attach to reconciling Community law and international conventions, albeit in such a way that the substance of international conventions does not automatically become legally binding in Community law. Finally, mention should be made of the guarantee that codecision will apply in connection with future procedures. Welcome as this result is, we cannot, however, rest on our laurels. The Water Framework Directive now needs to be put into effect. I should also, of course, particularly like to thank the Portuguese Presidency and, finally and most especially, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann. Our shared success has only been made possible by her incredible commitment and the huge amount of time and energy she put into her work. It was a pleasure for me to cooperate with a colleague in this way. My own special thanks go to you, Mrs Lienemann, and our own staff here in Parliament.

 Mr President, I should like to ask the Commission what is happening with the 1991 Directive on ecological water quality which has so far not officially been withdrawn by the European Commission. One further request, both to Parliament’s President and to the Council and the Commission: the texts are still deficient in so far as the specialist terminology in the specific languages is not correct. I would ask for this to be re-examined, for the terminology in each country is quite distinct. It is a problem which the translators could not solve because the text is so specialised. It would be a poor show if the legal texts did not contain the correct and necessary terminology. I would therefore ask for this matter to be looked into again. In the German version alone, I have found more than twenty mistakes. I happily leave it to you to examine this matter.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs Breyer has just indicated, we are dealing today with the second individual directive deriving from the framework Directive of 1996 on the assessment and management of ambient air quality. The main aim of the proposed legislation is to establish limit values for atmospheric concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide in order to improve the quality of our air and to avoid, prevent and reduce the adverse effects of these substances on human health and the environment. It is true that the main source of emissions of both pollutants is road traffic. Other major sources of benzene emissions are fuel distribution, oil refineries and the chemical industry, while all combustion processes emit carbon monoxide. This directive is a very important contribution to the maintenance of clean air and to the global climate strategy. The proposal was presented by the European Commission in December 1998. The Finnish presidency made a determined effort to use the new legal scope offered by the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to have this proposed directive enter into force back in December 1999 after the first reading, with the amendments adopted by the European Parliament. Our Group would have warmly welcomed that. I need hardly say that our Group supported the amendments which emphasise the danger to certain sections of the population and which regard the proposed environmental measures as surpassable minimum standards. The provisions on a single extension of the deadline and on compliance with the limit values that are required for climatic reasons in our southern Member States, provisions which are now contained in the common position, were introduced by ourselves at the time of the first reading, as was the maximum benzene concentration of 10 micrograms per cubic metre. Mrs Breyer, of course, has already given some indication of the subsequent harmonious development of the common position. This now contains the very wording that we wanted on this point, and its other provisions are consistent and provide for practicable measures to improve air quality in Europe. Our Group accepts this common position and can support it as it stands. This new regime guarantees that public health will be afforded a high level of protection, and it is flexible enough to be adapted at any time in response to technological progress. Mrs Breyer has taken a great deal of trouble and has achieved much of what Parliament wanted at the negotiating table. I must say, however, that in our view the amendments which have been reintroduced are superfluous; while they are justifiable, it is not worth putting the directive on ice again for the sake of these amendments, which would only delay the adoption process. We consider it far more important – as you yourself said, Mrs Breyer – that, after a delay of half a year, this instrument should now enter into force as quickly as possible, so that it can play its part in improving the quality of the air we breathe in Europe. For that reason, our Group does not support the amendments, because we hope that, by withholding our support, we can expedite the process of adopting this directive.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution although I did not agree with the individual points. I regret that, at the end of the day, only 238 Members voted for the text, and I would like to ask those responsible for the running of this House to check whether the procedure followed really made sense. To my mind, the fact that so many amendments were tabled is a sign that there had been a failure to reach sufficient agreement beforehand, and the fact that not even the compromise amendments were adopted is a sign that we were not yet ready to vote on this in plenary. I would also ask you, Mr President, to raise this vote in the Bureau, and to consider whether we cannot arrange matters differently, so that we avoid a mammoth voting session like this, which has lasted two and a half hours. And I am sure that in the end there was not a single Member here who could understand what this was all about. We should make sure we do not have procedures like this in plenary in future!

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as I, and I believe the majority of my fellow delegates are concerned, the crunch question is whether a programme will be put forward at the end of the Intergovernmental Conference that creates the conditions we need to strengthen our own foundation and admit a further 12 States.   When I hear the ongoing debate and consider how much opposition there has been from the Council over the past few months, some members of which are barely prepared to go beyond the three “leftovers”, then I think it is hypocritical to conduct negotiations with the candidate countries at the same time. Today’s statement by President-in-Office of the Council Gama has inspired me with a little more confidence, but I still see no evidence of political will on the part of the other Member States.   Our goal must be to equip our parliamentary representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference with a clear negotiating brief, which we will then also use as a yardstick for assessing the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference. In my view, it is crucial that we set down a clear marker for the proportional composition of a future European Parliament, subject to an upper limit of 700 Members. Extending majority voting in the Council must lead to codecision rights for the European Parliament. The Council must have open meetings when it takes on the role of legislator. We need to clearly distinguish between competences at European and national level without delay.   The self-inflicted crisis in the Council is a matter of deep regret to me. I would like to ask the Council how it proposes to pull off the stroke of excluding a certain Member State from taking part in discussions without any legal basis, when it needs this State’s support in order to achieve unanimity in the Council on Treaty amendments. I cannot support the proposal in recital 29 of the report to make the procedure for suspending a Member State easier. How I vote at tomorrow’s vote on this resolution will depend on the outcome of the vote on these issues.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fundamental rights, citizens, freedom and human rights have a long tradition in Europe. Fundamental rights of the modern age have their origins in the Magna Carta Libertatum of 1215, the Petition of Rights of 1628, the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, the Bill of Rights of 1689 and, lastly, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen during the French Revolution. The fact that fundamental rights have come to be guaranteed under constitutional law over the past 200 years is largely down to the impact these universal documents of fundamental rights have had. It is now the task of twenty-first century Europe to combine the existing fundamental rights in the Member States and those aspects that apply to Europe. The fundamental rights such as freedom of worship, freedom to meet and form associations, for example, are sacrosanct and inalienable rights to freedom from state intervention. Applied to Europe this means that a European Charter of Fundamental Rights must protect the citizens of the European Union against the interference and intervention of European institutions in the fundamental rights of the citizens. Furthermore, our group hopes that a written European catalogue of fundamental rights will put European integration on a firmer legal-ethical footing and help to create greater transparency and clarity for the citizens. Our group deems it particularly important that the European Charter should neither replace nor infringe Member States’ own provisions on fundamental rights. There has been heated discussion over the call for the European Union to sign up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms drawn up by the Council of Europe in 1950. The Council of Europe’s Convention is now 50 years old. Our group opposes the Union’s signing up to the Convention, not just because the existing European treaties do not permit this but, in particular, because we need our own catalogue of fundamental rights for the European Union, that is, one that reflects the convictions and beliefs we hold today. At the same time, however, this means that we must confine ourselves to the traditional fundamental rights and avoid extending the scope to social and economic fundamental rights, which are not legally enforceable at European level.  I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the comprehensive work they have done, and hope that the deliberations of the European Parliament find their way into the Convention’s discussions on the elaboration of fundamental rights.

 Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer. Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship. We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all. We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours. Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front?

 Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means. It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be. In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission. The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures. Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens. On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed. For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees. Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors. A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi
 of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases. It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny. With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced – as the European Parliament had long wanted – to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure. Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement. Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament. A key problem is the time factor. When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish. In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days. Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react. Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full. I just have one more request. In the German version, paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification, which I would also like to see in the printed version later. In my view, instead of “weitergeführt werden müssen
” the wording should be “erhalten bleiben müssen
”. The German version is not very clear here. I would ask for that to be checked again. For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur. It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings. The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions. I am sorry that Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede. We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994. A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers. We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added. You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different. Some want tighter legislation, some want more clarification, others want to serve national interests. Even within my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there were, of course, differences of opinion. Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions. In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position. Some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament’s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers. We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament’s credibility. For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020. That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings. I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws, however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States. I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted. That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money. Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days. You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water. The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too. I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter. I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises. I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for all her work and her cooperative attitude, even if we have agreed to differ on certain points. And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission, who stood by with advice and expert help at all times. If the representatives of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach, then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure.

Mr President, the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union. Will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because, in the final analysis, we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union? My question therefore is this: will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions?

Mr President, let me say on behalf of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats that this proposal for a directive is another brick in the edifice of European air quality policy. The air quality framework directive is implemented by issuing daughter directives on a series of air pollutants. This is the second such daughter directive and it relates to the limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide in the air and the corresponding control and information requirements. The purpose of our proposed amendments is not only to stipulate strict environmental protection requirements but to format these requirements so that they can be transposed and complied with by all Member States. In order to achieve this objective, certain compromises need to be made, especially with regard to our southern Member States. From this point of view, the specifications of the European Commission and the extensive amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection are very demanding. The Finnish Presidency is making a serious effort to make use of the new legal possibilities afforded by the Amsterdam Treaty and to bring this proposal into force after the first reading with the amendments of the European Parliament. We all know how urgent the problem of reducing air pollution is, also with respect to climatic change. As Mrs Breyer has already pointed out, the real aim is to improve health protection for our citizens. On these grounds, I welcome the plan of the Finnish Presidency. But that also means that we in the European Parliament must responsibly create the right conditions. It is precisely for this reason that I am unable to agree with certain proposed amendments adopted by a majority in the Committee on the Environment and tabled mainly by Mrs Breyer and her group, because some are superfluous and do not help to improve the text while others have no place in this proposal for a directive because they do not concern the scope of the proposed directive. It is for this reason that we reject a series of proposed amendments. My proposed amendment of Article 3(2) was adopted by a large majority in committee. In consultations with advisers, our rapporteur, Mrs Breyer, and experts, we again supplemented and tightened up this amendment. This is proposed amendment 22, which I would ask you all to support. I would like to thank Mrs Breyer. She was at pains to find a consensus and it was not easy, but I think that if we confine ourselves to the basic proposed amendments which improve the Commission proposal, and this refers mainly to Amendment Nos 1, 5, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16 and 22, it should be possible to pass this important directive quickly. I imagine, hope and expect that, in its reply, the Commission will support this directive and really pave the way for it to be implemented as quickly as possible.

Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the PPE group and, more importantly, on behalf of my colleague, Marlies Flemming, who is attending the WTO negotiations for the Committee on the Environment and is therefore unfortunately unable to take the floor here today. The original Commission proposal sought to set up a monitoring system to provide reliable information on CO2 emissions from new cars. The proposal forms part of the European Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption. Other elements of this strategy are an agreement with the automobile industry on reducing CO2 emissions by a certain deadline and a fuel consumption labelling system in order to make it easier for consumers to choose a new car. This strategy is certainly a logical one because we know that about half of all CO2 emissions are caused by traffic; however, we should also note that about 12% of all CO2 emissions are emitted in the European Union and about 88% in the rest of the world. The Council of Ministers has adopted a number of amendments tabled by the European Parliament at first reading which strengthen the original Commission proposal. These amendments refer, for example, to the Kyoto protocol, the importance of collecting data so that the voluntary agreement to reduce CO2 emissions from cars by 2003 can be properly monitored, the European Commission’s undertaking to report on the monitoring data forwarded by Member States to the European Parliament and, finally, some additions to the information to be forwarded. We therefore welcome the Council’s common position. If we are to create an efficient monitoring system without too much delay, we need to adopt this proposal as quickly as possible. The decision could then enter into force this year. That would mean that the year 2000 would be the first year for which data then needed to be compiled.

 Mr President, you will not believe this, but exactly 200 years ago, namely in 1799, there was the first discussion of a constitution, not for Europe but for Bavaria. This was partly for the purpose of establishing responsibilities but also because of the radical shifts in territory due to an almost 83 per cent increase in the area of Bavaria. The person with the big idea of having a constitution was the then Bavarian prime minister, Graf Montgelas, who did himself great credit by establishing a French administration in Bavaria. However, he was at the same time also the fiercest opponent of a parliament, because this could supposedly introduce unpredictable factors into politics. The arguments for and against went on for a further 18 years until at last the constitution was established and its opponents were finally quashed. And there were then already democratic elements in this constitution.  Now, something else that is astonishing: the basis of the constitution was, at that time, a preamble which was drafted in 1799 and which was to set out the fundamental rights, and all this 200 years ago! I think the parallels between then and now are quite amazing. History shows that the doubters’ arguments, both then and now, are almost the same. Let us learn from history not to allow further decades to go by before Europe has a constitution. This is something for the future that we must prepare for.  I should therefore like to encourage the Council not only to respect Parliament’s proposals but also to make them its own. We need a Europe which is able to act and which can also take necessary decisions. For we must also take democracy seriously, and the responsibilities which the national parliaments have given away must pass into the hands of the European Parliament, that is to say become part of the process of codecision making. We need codecision making by the European Parliament, for the European Parliament is the biggest factor favouring the integration of Europe.

 Madam President, at the start of the sitting you not only reported events in Armenia, but also informed us that you would be sending a message to Armenia. As the president of the delegation for cooperation between the European Union and Armenia, I would like to thank you most sincerely for that. We are all horrified at the tragic events which occurred last night in the Armenian Parliament. Not only the head of government, but also the president of the parliament and several other politicians were murdered. We must ask ourselves whether peaceful development is now possible in Armenia. The raid has plunged the new Republic of Armenia, located in direct proximity to Chechnya, into a state of emergency, the effects of which cannot yet be predicted. I think you all share my hope that the recently won independence of Armenia will not thereby be threatened once again. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly my thanks for the good things which have quite rightly been mentioned. I would like to mention three points. Firstly, services. The cleaning personnel always used to do their work very early. Arriving at the office at half past seven, one could work in peace. Now they come much later. If one wishes to be on time in the Chamber at 9 o’clock, the lifts are full of cleaning staff who take much longer to get in and out because they have their trolleys. Would it not be possible to ensure that the cleaning staff do not carry out their work at a time which is the peak time for the Members of Parliament? The times we work are well known. Please give this further consideration. The second is again access to the garages. It has already been mentioned, but every time we are arriving or leaving with all our luggage, if we take advantage of the travel service, we have to cope with these colossal stairs. This is really hard with all your suitcases and papers. It is inadequate. I request that this be put to an end. The third point is the multiplicity of different cards. I have kept asking, whether it is not technically possible these days to have a single electronic card for everything. I do not know if you have noticed that the card which opens the garage has to be used the other way round to Brussels. That means you have to take the thing out every time, then you lose it and so on and so forth, because it gets dropped. These things are just unacceptable. I maintain that modern technology is such that these things can be combined into a single item. Then we wouldn‘t have to carry around three, four or five different cards. Please look into this once more.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must be aware of the fact that there is seething unrest in the Caucasus. Right now it concerns the tragic fate of the people in Dagestan. Most news reports only give us a scant account of the drama taking place in this part of the world. We need humanitarian aid there urgently. The main thing would be above all for these people in Dagestan to be granted the same autonomy as they already have in neighbouring states. So what is happening? There is clearly a lack of objective information on the political situation there, but there is also a lack of respect for human rights. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe must be commissioned to prepare a report for our Parliament, the Commission and the Council, and the task which faces us generally in our various Groups must be directed particularly at obtaining such information as quickly as possible and reliably. Regardless of where responsibility lies for the situation in Dagestan, the fact remains that it is a result of the dramatic developments following the fall of the iron curtain and that the countries in this region have only managed with great difficulty to liberate themselves. In addition, the political authorities responsible continue to attempt to regulate ethnic groups and to create divisions between them. We have seen this in direct proximity to us in Europe in the former Yugoslavia, and now we are observing similar developments further away. We must do all we can to extinguish the fire that has been kindled there, so that the people in this part of the world also have the possibility of developing in peace, establishing their own autonomy, and having a future, such as we have already secured for ourselves in Europe. We should not forget that a few decades ago we lived through a similar fate here in Europe. We were then reasonable and came to an understanding, and it is now our job to help people there in their development, which may perhaps run a similar course, but which can in any case offer them the possibility of a future, in which their existence is secure, and where they can take control of their own destiny.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed an exceptional occurrence to discuss hops in the middle of a group of Mediterranean products, and this is probably the reason why it was originally down for discussion at a different time. It is a small sector, but hops are undoubtedly a very important product to those who have anything to do with them; their significance is akin to that of hormones in human or animal processes or of catalysts in physical or chemical reactions. Anyone who was unaware of the importance of hops, Mr President, could no longer remain so after enjoying, in moderation, the product for which it is used – the beer to which you referred before, the elixir of life. I believe that beer – consumed in moderation, of course, as I have already said– is also a healthy foodstuff; we Bavarians know that better than most, and you, as a Franconian, are equally well aware of its qualities. Like wine, beer is a special product, and some people, including Mr Daul, the chairman of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, also refer to it as Hopfentee
, or ‘hop tea’. I shall now confine myself to hops, Mr President, but my introductory remarks leave me in need of a little extra time. The common organisation of the market in hops has existed since 1971, and down through the years it has proved to be a flexible, simple and yet very efficient arrangement. Last year’s report from the Commission also laid particular emphasis on that point. The aims and measures of the existing regime, however, namely hop production based on quality and response to market demand, coupled with a comprehensive proof-of-origin system, were ultimately made achievable primarily by vigorous producer groups. For this reason, I intend to restrict myself, in the short time at my disposal, to two points, the first being support, including future support, for producer groups; this is why, in the amendment, I have proposed the incorporation of an option whereby the retained component of up to 25% of the national ceiling may be paid to either producer groups or producers themselves. My second point concerns the inclusion in the system of grubbed-up areas, which have helped to stabilise the market, and I emphasise that very strongly.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first make a small, general observation. At this point, I would like to express our particular thanks to the ladies and gentlemen of the Committee secretariat, to our staff and the staff in the Parliamentary groups. All have been under enormous pressure of time. In particular I must thank the rapporteur with dual responsibility for cereals and dried fodder, our French colleague, Mr Dominique Souchet, for his two sound and, from a practical point of view, balanced reports, and above all, for the truly remarkable and transparent cooperation and close coordination across group boundaries, right from the start. This is not always the case in this House. We in this House – and we really should see this – consider ourselves the chosen representatives of the public and understand the individual working situation more precisely and also much more clearly than others – even including the Commission. Now, briefly, let me turn to the report by Mr Souchet on the subject of cereals. We consider the proposed reduction in the intervention price unnecessary. Ten years of continuous intervention price reductions have left it almost at the level of the world market price. Even the additional monthly charges – Commissioner, I know I said 'yes, but' – ultimately help towards better distribution over the year. Of course there have been many suggestions here today – for which we are grateful – regarding the proposed situation in the rye sector. Amendment No 28 – I mention this amendment in particular – also contains a measure to limit surplus. It provides opportunities for increased consumption at various levels on the one hand, and the restriction of rye cultivation to limited farm locations – as Mrs Fiebiger has already pointed out, this is by and large where the heart of the matter lies. Regarding potato starch, which is of course regulated by the cereal market organisation, we envisage the fundamental retention of production refunds. Nevertheless we will get a decoupling or a step-by-step partial decoupling of cereals. With regard to the report on dried fodder, Commissioner, I find the total abolition of the dried fodder regulation incomprehensible. For many of our grassland farms the cooperative drying plants maintained by farmers are a valuable means of support, which make an important contribution to the supply of mineral-rich fodder. As Mr Goepel has already pointed out, we have all seen the danger that discussion of this reform is happening too close to WTO issues, and also to the discussion on the future structure of the enlarged EU. In actual fact the current discussion and this conclusion are vital. We have shown that we have carried out our responsibilities regarding co-determination. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are again, with farmers demonstrating because we are dealing with food issues. I believe it to be important that we should keep fighting to win consumers' trust, and it is particularly with regard to foodstuffs that more precise labelling is vitally necessary. In my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like first to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, for her fine cooperation. Even though, when discussions started, we approached issues of detail from slightly different angles, as a whole we took the same line, so that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy complemented each other very well, something which I do think should be mentioned and appreciated at this time. As a whole, the Commission proposal amounted to a welcome advance in the labelling of foodstuffs, but no doubt there is nothing so good that it cannot be improved. That was a task for us here in Parliament. The existing rule that all food ingredients – including constituent parts of compound foodstuffs – must be enumerated in the so-called list of ingredients on the label did indeed provide for derogations. Mrs Klaß has addressed the question of the so-called 25% rule. We often hear it said by way of justification for this that labels were made too all-inclusive by the large number of constituents listed on them, thereby ending up being unreadable, which was no doubt a bit extreme. The Commission itself made reference to the absence of uncertainty in Member States where this rule did not apply. No doubt the 25% rule was problematic mainly in that consumers could not know, when buying processed foods, whether they contained substances that might trigger allergies, in that even very small proportions of these were significant to the consumer. I do think that this context makes it clear that an even closer look needs to be taken at the difference in Amendments Nos 7 and 12, and consideration given either before or after the adoption of the directive as to whether this scientific basis for the inclusion of allergenic substances is the right one.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a saying that what is good is worth waiting for, and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the rapporteur, has referred clearly to the never-ending story of the matter under discussion. It is specifically with reference to co-decision that it has at last been made clear that Parliament keeps on coming up with good ideas that find their way into work like this report on the never-ending story about the declaration of compound feedingstuffs. We must be clear in our own minds that we are dealing here with large quantities, and therefore with a lot of money – not the European Union's money, but that of our partners in the market. We are dealing with a volume of some 400 million tonnes of feedingstuffs, and it will help us to grasp how much we are talking about if we note that half, about 200 million tonnes, is made up of commercial feedingstuffs, and compound feedingstuffs make up two-thirds of that, some 115 million tonnes. As Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf pointed out, the conciliation procedure eventually achieved a satisfactory result on the most important points at third reading stage by involving all interested parties – something which I should like very much to commend. As Parliament demanded, there is now open quantitative declaration, and, although the 15% is in my opinion at the upper edge of the margin, consensus has nonetheless been reached. It was also clearly stated that the producer, must however, and I see the 'must however' as very important here, state the exact percentages involved at the customer’s request. Thirdly, there is the positive list. About 20 000 components have been mentioned, and the drawing up of this positive list may well be a difficult task, but it will, I think, be an interesting and important one. More time has been conceded, and even more for formulation following the directive's implementation, but it is, I think, important that it should happen that way. Perhaps the evaluation report would present the right opportunity to introduce further improvements, such as, for example, the possible certification of the producer of the compound feedingstuffs. There is one more point I would like to mention, namely that the first positive list, to look at things in a European perspective, was the so-called purity law for beer. As I have said before, it was instituted in 1486 in the area I come from, and made applicable to the whole of Bavaria in 1516. It was a fine positive list for the production of beer, and you should put all your drive and ambition into drafting an equally good positive list for compound feedingstuffs. So, then, particular thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, to the chairman of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Friedrich, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mr Kindermann for the tough and persistent negotiations.

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, regarding protein deficits Commissioner Fischler mentioned a few options which are available in the European Union. But, Commissioner, I think, and I am sure you know, that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wanted to give a clear signal with the Auroi report that promoting the planting of protein crops on set-aside lands would be given more support. I am convinced that Parliament will take this line. Back, however, to the first issue. The chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Herr Graefe zu Baringdorf, said that how the production of mixed feedingstuffs had evolved over the years had been an eye-opener. How different positions have been put forward at different times here in Parliament has also been an eye-opener. The path has not always been smooth, it has had its rough edges and there has been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing. I think, however, we are now on the right path towards showing even greater transparency and not only promoting it but implementing it as well. There have been hostilities and demands from industry against which Parliament and representatives in Parliament, with a clear majority, have always stood their ground. From the outset, Parliament has followed a clear line for more transparency. Cards are being shuffled in the production of compound feedingstuffs and wherever cards are shuffled we need to be especially careful about whether we are actually dealing with a game of cards or the production of feedingstuffs. We have been careful to implement transparency more visibly than in the past, which is only right and proper. You are smiling, Commissioner Fischler. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf talked about a half-open declaration, which has been something special in recent years. I would like to say that it would have been more correct not to talk of a disguised but a half-disguised declaration. That may have brought about more movement in the direction we now want to go in. Transparency and the positive list are necessary and would be a further improvement to the Commission proposal. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take an example from another area of the food industry, and that is the purity regulations for beer. The purity regulations were introduced and became law in Bavaria in 1516, which was right and proper. A positive list was introduced then and a positive list should be introduced now. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent weeks and months when agriculture has been debated, there has been much talk of a change of direction in agricultural policy. I certainly do not wish to address these topical problems here, but I do think that some aspects of the debate have been neglected. What I am getting at is the fact that surely it can hardly be right to pillory the whole of European agriculture right across the board or to condemn wholesale the achievements of the common agricultural policy. The European sugar market policy, of all policies, has done nothing to deserve a judgement of this kind. The common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector is like a horse on the road to victory, as has also been repeatedly stressed in this debate. For many years now, consumers have been supplied with a safe basic foodstuff, and this at reasonable prices. Some critics think and claim that sugar is too expensive, however. Mr Daul referred to this, but it should set alarm bells ringing; firstly, because these critics are hardly concerned about the well-being of consumers but about their own profits; secondly, because the production of a basic foodstuff in compliance with European environmental and social standards has a legitimate price and thirdly, because, measured against consumers' purchasing power worldwide, the sugar price which we have in Europe can probably also be described as one of the lowest. Some people also say that the common organisation of the market in sugar is a dinosaur. It has been in force for 32 years, since 1968, but of course it has been repeatedly adapted. That is why it is now also necessary to have a longer period of validity, of at least five years, as the rapporteur, Mr Daul, has said. It would be wrong to change the compensation system for storage costs… (The President cut the speaker off)

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a proverb which says that good things come to those who wait. The words of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf certainly illustrated the aptness of that proverb to the present situation. Besides the week's major topics, namely our discussions, decisions and votes on enlargement and institutional reform, there have been other subjects that the public has also been following with interest, subjects on which the position of the general public can also be said to have moved perceptibly. Over the past few years, public awareness of food-safety issues in particular has heightened considerably, and this naturally extends to animal feed as well as human foodstuffs. Just think of BSE or dioxin, and you will know what I mean. The discussions on the Paulsen reports, of course, clearly illustrated this. The marketing of animal feed, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the trading of animal feed, also engenders this awareness. When mixing takes place, in the case of compound feedingstuffs, I believe the need for caution is even greater, whether these compounds are functional foods or feed mixes. In the case of these products, more detailed labelling is expected. Higher priority must be given to verifiability. The mandatory open declaration is essential, and the greatest possible degree of transparency is necessary throughout the supply chain. I believe, too, that transparency will ultimately strengthen competition; it stands to reason that transparent competition creates a greater incentive to manufacture the best possible mixes. Farmers quite simply have to know more precisely what is in their compound feedingstuffs, and they must also be able to find out, at least on request, the percentage content of each ingredient. That is their right as purchasers as well as being consistent with the interests of consumers. Equally important, of course, is the food-safety aspect – beef is another issue here – and traceability. This, at least, is well embedded in the proposal. The amendments make the proposal better still. The PPE-DE Group approves Amendments Nos 1 to 5 but cannot support Amendment No 6. The question of genetically modified cereals should be regulated elsewhere. We support the amended Graefe zu Baringdorf report and the legislative resolution. Let me express our thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and to Mrs Roth-Behrendt. Nevertheless, it is essential that we continue to stand firm. (Applause)

Mr President, you really have to rub your eyes two or three times when you read what kind of proposal the Commission has come up with by way of a solution to these problems, which have been discussed time and again. It is absolutely true what Mr Souchet, as rapporteur, and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have had to say on the subject. They have my unequivocal support. On the other hand, however, there can be no doubt that the bottleneck in the budget and also the special WTO agreements represent a completely new challenge at the end of the day, particularly where export refunds are concerned. Who would have thought, even as little as a year ago, that we would be facing this conundrum, and having to weigh up the interests of agricultural product processors against those of the farmers who produce the products. If the Commission is now looking for a way to resolve this export bottleneck in products that are not covered by Annex I, then it is certainly responding to a need. Yet there is not the slightest suggestion in the Commission proposal that the problems facing the raw materials producers, i.e. the farmers, have been registered. I am in complete agreement with Mr Souchet. Thank you very much for all the work you have put into the report. He rightly complains that the Commission is offering no alternative courses of action. One thing is for sure though, there must be no restriction in the availability of raw materials at competitive prices, and at the end of the day, agricultural policy cannot be devoted exclusively to the protection of the raw materials producers. But then nor should the burden fall on one side alone in agriculture, or have to be borne by individual products. There are agricultural products that almost pay for the export refunds themselves, at the end of the day, owing to contributions from the producers, i.e. the farmers. Sugar is a case in point. The farmers’ contributions go into the general melting pot of the EU budget on the revenue side, and if export refunds are cut then these contributions will decline too. As I said, sugar is a particular case in point. I feel we must give special consideration to this issue, and give it priority where export refunds are concerned.

 Mr President, Commissioner, five minutes are enough for a Friday. I had actually anticipated having less time, which means that I can make a few additional comments and still keep to my time. Hops are a special kind of plant. (Applause)
 After all, they add flavour and wort to this important popular foodstuff we call beer.   (Applause)
 Truth is to be found not just in wine but also in beer. This is particularly important in the case of Bavaria, the land I come from and where this foodstuff we call beer has had an important role to play, both in terms of development down through the ages and the population’s outlook. Weißbier is, of course, a special kind of beer; it is well known in Munich and many people enjoy the taste. It is true that hops would grow almost anywhere but it takes people with special qualities to give the hops the care they need, so as to ensure a successful crop. There are a number of sayings about this, such as Der Hopf ist ein Tropf
 (hops are little rascals), which may prove rather difficult to translate but literally means: hops are a fickle crop that rewards careful tending particularly well but also makes one pay for sloppy work. Hops also expect a daily visit from the master. What all this amounts to is that hops are a very labour-intensive crop and therefore tend to be more widespread amongst people of an industrious bent. That explains why a large hop cultivation area has grown up where I come from. In central Bavaria, the Hallertau, a large hop cultivation area – in fact the largest in the world, because approximately one quarter of production derives from the Hallertau – has been developing over the last 150 years or more. Of course that is why this issue is of particular significance for Bavaria and for myself as a native of Bavaria.   (Applause)
 I would like to again emphasise the fact that hops and beer made from hops could be said to stand for sociableness, for relaxation even. Incidentally, hops are also used for medicinal purposes. Bavaria is primarily famous for being the land of beer, but also for being the land of tradition and progress. You are bound to have often heard it said that tradition and progress are rated particularly highly in Bavaria. Indeed, the lederhosen and laptop saying is often quoted by Bavaria’s leader Mr Stoiber. Bavaria is not just famous for the Oktoberfest in Munich but also for its high tech. It is not without reason that the world famous University of Brewing of Munich-Weihenstephan is located in Bavaria. It has disseminated a great deal of knowledge to the world and has heavily influenced both hop cultivation and beer production in the far-flung corners of China and Russia, and even in the USA. Hence another saying: Hopfen und Malz, Gott erhalt’s
 (hops and malt, may God preserve them). This is important, also with regard to the regulation put forward by the Commission.  I had a few other comments I wanted to make but I must keep within my time. I now come to the regulation and the report. It all boils down to the fact that many provisions in this area can no longer be used owing to their no longer being valid or due to the implications of the common organisation of the markets for hops. What it amounts to is that there is no longer a requirement to draft a major report annually, rather, owing to the fact that grants have been established for a period of five years, a report only has to be submitted once every five years from now on. Commissioner, I consider this plan to be right-minded, but with one minor reservation. It is only right, in view of the vast experience we have accumulated in Bavaria, that we should also pay a little more attention to the situation there, hence my suggestion that we must ensure that, as is already the case, the annual collection of data relating to the development of the areas under cultivation, demand, the spread of different types, prices, and also cultivation development, proceeds uninterrupted in the individual Member States, and that this information is made available to all concerned on an annual basis. I have obtained the Commission’s consent for this to be done over the Internet. This is why I have put forward two amendments and I call upon Parliament to vote in favour of them. I know, however, that the Commission does not look very kindly upon these proposed amendments. However, Parliament is something of a different kettle of fish to the Commission in my view. That is why I am asking for your support. (Laughter, applause)
