Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let us stop ‘finning’! We must put a stop to indiscriminate capture of sharks in order to remove their precious and much sought-after fins before throwing the huge shark bodies back into the sea. There must be an end to exemptions for special permits. This is what Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has asked for in its opinion, on which I acted as rapporteur, which despite some opposition from the Committee on Fisheries, will be approved in full by this House tomorrow. The European Union, in line with the view of the scientific world, decided to outlaw finning in 2003, but the exemptions allowed by the current legislation make it impossible to combat a phenomenon that poses a serious threat to the survival of this particularly vulnerable species. There is no other way to go: only by making it mandatory for fins to be landed still naturally attached to the body can a simple and effective control of the ban on on-board finning be achieved. Encouraging conservation of shark stocks will bring about genuinely sustainable fishing. I therefore call on Parliament to support the proposal. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 2013 will rightly be the Year of European Citizens. This is an important initiative because recalling and enhancing awareness, in particular among young people, of the rights and achievements attached to European citizenship should be treated as an absolute priority. Today, thanks to the process of European integration, EU citizens may live, work, study and travel freely within the territory of the Member States, use the health services, enjoy rights and protection as passengers and consumers, and vote and stand as candidates in elections to the European Parliament and in municipal elections in their Member State of residence. These are important achievements, which bring with them not just a strong symbolic connotation that strengthens and promotes the sense of belonging to Europe, but also undoubted advantages and practical opportunities. However, according to a Eurobarometer report, and as I can confirm on a daily basis in my work as an MEP, there is often a lack of awareness of these rights, and of the values and principles that inspire them. It is therefore essential to make every effort, particularly in the schools but also elsewhere, to raise awareness of and provide information on the great advantages of our dual citizenship, the European aspect of which enhances and strengthens the national aspect.

Madam President, protection of passenger rights is an increasingly important issue, especially at times of crisis such as the present, when transport cost cutting and sudden airline bankruptcy in the sector can cause serious disruption to passengers. All too often we read in the newspapers of cancelled flights and hundreds of passengers left to fend for themselves, sometimes for days on end; not to mention rail delays and cancellations, leaving thousands of workers, students and whole families stranded, often without information on alternative modes of transport to bring them home or to work. Passengers must be guaranteed more price transparency and must be protected against unfair commercial practices, such as the addition of non-optional operational costs and excessive restrictions on hand luggage. Efforts must be made to provide multilingual information points to deal with rerouting and cancellation of flights and trains, in order to provide the best protection possible for European citizens.

Mr President, reforming the common fisheries policy is a necessary decision that cannot be put off any longer. We fish too much in Europe, and we often fish badly. If we want to safeguard marine biological resources, conserve the marine ecosystem and ensure the survival of the fisheries sector, we have to give overexploited fish stocks time to recover. However, the view that prevailed in this Chamber today by only a few votes was the blinkered view of those who want to maintain the status quo and continue to condemn our seas and the whole fisheries sector to certain death. That is why I voted against the report on the reform of the common fisheries policy. We need a well-thought-out reform that allows for the sustainable exploitation of marine resources and not a watered-down text that offers no future prospects. We need multiannual management plans and a precise timetable, as well as a network of protected areas. I welcome sanctions against those Member States that do not abide by the rules, carry out inadequate controls, exceed their quotas and do not provide reliable data. Greater protection for the fish in our seas means more jobs for European fishermen, but there are some people in this Chamber who have not yet understood that. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, the current global economic and environmental crisis requires us to make choices to save resources. With the Energy Efficiency Directive adopted today, we can achieve important goals, such as tackling the problem of climate change and the scarcity of fossil fuels, including coal and oil; cutting the annual cost of buying fuel, which amounts to EUR 400 billion, by making a potential saving of EUR 50 billion per year; reducing Europe’s dependency on Russia and OPEC countries, from which we import gas and oil; reducing air pollution, which, in some regions of Europe, currently poses an unfortunately unresolved threat to the health of millions of European citizens; creating new jobs and benefits for small and medium-sized enterprises, including installers and the building sector, which is currently going through a very serious crisis. I therefore welcome the rules introduced for the renovation of public buildings and for four-yearly energy audits, which are compulsory for all large enterprises. This is one of the many steps Europe needs to take. However, we need to do more: we must set ourselves more ambitious targets and take measures that are more binding on all Member States. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today is a very important day for the health of European citizens. Indeed, this is, without doubt, one of the most important reforms of the entire parliamentary term when one considers the beneficial impact it will have on the health of European citizens. From today, the EU has stricter regulations and is establishing new upper limits on the sulphur content of marine fuels, which contain air pollutants that are estimated to cause as many as 50 000 premature deaths in Europe. For Northern European countries – the so-called Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) – a maximum sulphur content in fuels of below 0.1% comes into force from 2015 while, for all other countries, the limit will be 0.5% from 2020. We should no doubt have aimed higher; these new limits should have applied across the whole of the European Union. What price life, though? That is what thousands of European citizens are wondering in cities with major ports like that of my beautiful mistreated Venice, whose inhabitants and whose works of art are constantly being poisoned by smoke from the stacks of great ships. Well, thanks to Europe, that smoke will now be a little less black. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on the welfare of animals because it introduces important concepts for a better future for animals and European citizens. Issues including a new directive to protect dogs and cats, the violation of the directives on zoos and laying hens by many Member States, and maintaining the March 2013 deadline for cosmetics tested on animals must be addressed urgently and as a matter of priority. We also need to provide for mandatory labelling for meat from animals barbarically slaughtered without being stunned. We must adopt an EU law on animal welfare and set up a body that monitors whether the Member States enforce the rules on the industry. We can and we must, however, do much more for animal welfare. Modern, civilised Europe can no longer tolerate barbaric, uncivilised and backwards practices such as vivisection, hunting or bullfighting. Let us renounce these absurd activities right now, for a Europe that is more respectful of animals and more respectful of the views of its citizens, who are often much more far-sighted, caring and sensitive than national and EU authorities.

 In the resolution on the establishment of an EU legal framework for the protection of pets and stray animals, it is reiterated that the European Union is based on sharing different principles and values. Millions of European citizens attach a special sentimental value to animals and in particular to pets, such as dogs and cats. There are more than 100 million pets in Europe, but despite the large number, the EU still does not have an EU framework law to protect our pets and stray animals. With today’s vote, Parliament is giving a voice to thousands of European citizens and is urging the EU to establish a framework law to protect animals and in particular to lay down: rules for the identification and registration of animals; stray animal management strategies, including vaccination and sterilisation programmes; measures to promote responsible ownership; the prohibition of unlicensed kennels and shelters; the prohibition of killing of stray animals without medical indication; information and educational programmes in schools on animal welfare; and severe sanctions to be imposed on any Member State which fails to comply with the rules.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is life; water is a precious public asset that we have a duty and an interest in conserving and managing sustainably in order to safeguard ecosystems and the very survival of the human race. This important report takes stock of the implementation status of EU water legislation ahead of the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’, which the Commission has announced for this autumn. Much has been done in the 12 years since the Water Framework Directive entered into force, but there is still a huge amount left to do, especially in many southern European countries such as Italy, which is to appear before the Court of Justice because of delays in implementing the directive. We have to ensure sufficient availability of good-quality water, bearing in mind that water resources in Europe are distributed unevenly, and consequently we must mainstream this issue in all European policy areas. It is unacceptable that as much as 70% of the water supplied to our communities may be lost through leakage due to the poor state of repair of our water systems. We must reach the target of a green economy and equip ourselves with locally developed water plans that strictly combat waste and encourage water saving, reuse and recycling, whether for irrigation or for domestic use, and across all sectors of the economy. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the amendments to the regulation on the recovery of bluefin tuna stocks because, as acknowledged by the international scientific community, this is a species at risk of extinction. The figures speak for themselves: since 2009, there has been a sharp decrease in catches in all our seas. We therefore need to act swiftly in order to prevent the stock from disappearing completely. A telling example of the seriousness of the situation is the reduction in the average size of tuna fish, a phenomenon which is strikingly obvious in the Adriatic Sea, my region. We must urgently set up closed areas and sanctuaries for bluefin tuna where fishing is banned to allow stocks to recover. We need to step up controls, since illegal fishing in all European seas is still too widespread and too frequent. The envisaged measures, such as the seizure of illegal vessels and gear, must go hand in hand with effective, efficient controls, carried out by an appropriate number of employees. Lastly, it is essential to raise the minimum weight of tuna fish that may be caught, currently just 30 kilograms, and ban fishing during the spawning season. In order to save bluefin tuna we can, and must, do more. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Gerbrandy on an excellent report. The transition to a resource-efficient economy is inevitable and necessary. In 2050, the global population will reach 9 billion people and each of them will strive for a better life. As indicated by the Commission, at the current rate of resource use, in 2050, the equivalent of two Earths will be needed to sustain the world’s population. The case for ensuring each and every European policy is resource-efficient is therefore also economic. Member States must remove all obstacles to the market in waste recycling and reuse and provide economic incentives to promote innovative technologies for the collection and separation of waste. It is right to get to zero waste by banning landfill and phasing out the incineration of recyclables. We have to agree on indicators for resource use in economic activity, in other words, our footprint on the planet, our water footprint, our materials footprint and our carbon footprint. These indicators have to be used to promote legislative initiatives for sustainable development and less use of resources. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regional airports are important for improving Europe’s links and allowing its citizens to move around inside the Union, but these structures must be built and operated according to the European Union’s own environmental standards. We cannot allow air traffic, and with it regional airports, to further harm the European environment, our air quality and the well-being of our region. In northern Italy, for example – I am thinking of the cities of Treviso and Verona – the airport structures have been expanded in recent years without due consideration for the contexts in which these airports operate on a daily basis. More air connections in Europe are fine, but not at the cost of Europe’s environment, air and land. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against climate change is necessary for the survival of the planet. It is absolutely critical that Europe and all stakeholders strive to limit the increase in average temperatures to 2 °C. This is the only way that we can lower the risk of natural disasters, and consequent migration and population displacement. It is acknowledged at international level that it is certainly the poor who suffer the most. Well, 70% of the world’s poorest are women. In the developing world, it is women who play a crucial role in the abstraction and practical management of water, not just in the home but also in farming, and it is women who today have to work more owing to droughts and water shortages resulting precisely from climate change. This is why gender perspectives must be mainstreamed into all stages of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiation process, in order to effectively improve the welfare of women around the world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to what might soon be happening in one of Italy’s finest forests, the Cansiglio, located between the Veneto and Friuli regions. This is an area of great natural importance, part of the Natura 2000 network. It is here in this forest, once protected by the Most Serene Republic of Venice, that for the first time – after a ban that has lasted for centuries – hundreds of deer will be hunted, under proposals from the provinces of Treviso and Belluno and the Veneto and Friuli regional administrations. Pregnant does, on the point of delivery, will also be brutally killed, as set out in the culling plans. Under the pretext of overpopulation, disputed by the Worldwide Fund for Nature and many other associations, the Italian authorities are giving the green light to these killings. The EU must more effectively ensure compliance with directives protecting biodiversity, providing appropriate sanctions for any local administrations that violate them. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 215 million children worldwide used as child labour, 152 million child workers under the age of 15, 115 million children involved in dangerous activities – these are shocking figures that we can no longer tolerate. I voted in favour of the resolution on child labour in the cocoa sector, with absolute conviction, because the European Union has to play a fundamental role in stopping this form of modern slavery. The Commission must do its utmost to include effective provisions that will guarantee dignified employment and prevent forced child labour in all trade agreements with cocoa producing countries such as Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. We need a traceability mechanism to identify goods produced using child labour. The European Union has always defended the rights of the world’s most vulnerable people, and children working in the harvesting of cocoa beans deserve our full attention. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, one of the most important issues highlighted by the European Union Growth Survey 2012 is the serious need for new and stronger social and employment policies, especially for young people. A country with a high level of youth unemployment is a country destined to perish. In my country, Italy, the statistics are frightening. According to Eurostat data for November 2011, the youth unemployment rate is 30.1%. Young people who are often highly qualified with plenty of energy and motivation are allowed to wither away by a system where gerontocracy has become the norm. The Commission’s commitment in allocating EUR 82 billion from unused Structural Funds to stimulate growth and youth unemployment is a good step that needs to be made in the right direction. Investing in young people means investing in the future. Guaranteeing work for young Europeans means guaranteeing a future for us all. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Madam President, I should like to draw the attention of the Chamber and of European citizens to what has been going on for months in Ukraine. Since it was decided to hold the Euro 2012 football championship in Poland and Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities have, in order to stage a quick clean-up of their cities, unleashed a savage cull of stray dogs. These poor animals, including mothers and puppies, are being killed in their thousands by poisoning, clubbing and shooting, while even mobile crematory ovens are being used for this purpose. This terrible news has been broadcast around the world. On the Internet, one can see images of these acts of horrifying violence, which have been denounced and documented by reporters and local animal-protection societies. In view of the special relations that we have with this country, I call upon the European institutions to make urgent representations to the Ukrainian authorities to stop this uncivilised and barbaric massacre. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is clear from the numerous waste-related petitions received by Parliament from citizens: EU management of waste in Europe is not going well. There are too many citizens who even now, in 2012, are paying for the consequences of poor waste management in terms of their daily lives and their health, incinerators and landfills being cases in point. All the same, virtuous examples of ecologically sustainable waste management in the EU do exist. We must therefore do all we can to reach a point of total recycling, where waste actually becomes a genuine resource. This is already a reality today. There are treatment plants that recycle nearly 100% of urban waste, as in the case of the Vedelago waste centre in the province of Treviso, whose technology is exported throughout Europe. Nevertheless, we need more controls, prevention and, above all, responsible choices. We should recycle, recover and reduce waste and say ‘no’ to huge incinerators and landfills that are often the cause of air and aquifer pollution. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the resolution on the forthcoming international United Nations conference in Durban because I think that the climate change challenges posed by global warming require, more than ever, extremely strong commitment from Europe. Climate upheaval due to overheating is shown by irrefutable scientific proof and the consequent environmental, human and economic damage is now quite clear to everyone. This situation requires us to take fast, courageous decisions. Europe must retain a leading role in the fight against global overheating, committing to provide aid to other countries in terms of technology and resources. These financial resources must also be recovered through an international ‘Tobin tax’ on financial transactions. The Durban conference must lead to a legally binding international agreement with tangible outcomes for the fight against global warming. Above all, it must produce a clear calendar with deadlines and precise commitments for all countries of the world. All countries must finally put collective interests above their own individual interests because either we make an effort, or we will all pay a very hefty price. These are tough, extremely important and essential decisions, because there is no plan B any more. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, protecting bees means protecting all pollinating insects, agriculture, the environment and the ecosystem. I have abstained from voting on the resolution of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development because it is incomplete and not effective enough. The use of neonicotinoid pesticides to treat maize seeds in agriculture has led to the destruction of millions of bees. In Italy, we have experienced losses of between 30% and 70% of hives, causing serious damage to beekeepers, bees and the environment. In the two years that Italy has prohibited the use of these pesticides, two important results have come about: the bee population has recovered, and it has been demonstrated that maize production has not diminished without the use of pesticides. Today’s resolution has been a missed opportunity to call for the banishment across Europe of neonicotinoid pesticides. Europe should undertake to defend this most important natural asset on a wider scale and with greater conviction. Albert Einstein said, ‘If all the bees died, man would have four years to live’.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the continent of Europe is extremely rich in fresh water but risks becoming poor in drinking water. This is a paradox caused by the rising number of cases of water table pollution. In my region of Veneto, in Italy, for example, authorisation has been given over the last 50 years for quarrying below the water table and landfill sites that have resulted in serious pollution of the water table, groundwater and wells for drinking water. In May of this year, the Veneto Regional Environmental Protection Agency found mercury poisoning in over 100 wells located in various municipalities in the province of Treviso. Therefore, we need to take prompt action to immediately unlock the crucial Soil Directive, which was adopted at first reading by the European Parliament in 2007 but has remained blocked by the Council. The directive makes it mandatory to register and reclaim contaminated sites, which would solve the problem of water table pollution. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, the hunting season opens in many European countries in September, and people begin to shoot millions of wild animals in the name of an anachronistic activity which can no longer be justified. Despite the protection laid down by European laws, in certain countries, such as Italy, some local authorities allow exceptional hunting, namely the hunting of protected birds such as chaffinches or meadow pipits, just to pander to the hunters’ lobby and secure their votes. The Veneto and Lombardy regions have recently approved exceptional hunting again, demonstrating contempt and indifference, not least towards the European Court of Justice and its very recent judgments on this subject. Europe needs stricter rules. In order to protect wild animals we have to put an end to this barbarian medieval practice. We need to put an immediate stop to these illegal rules in these regions.

Madam President, there are two aspects to the measure that we have adopted, one geopolitical and the other environmental. Geopolitically the introduction of shale gas extraction could have a positive effect for Europe, since it might reduce our dependence on Iranian and Russian resources, but there are strong environmental concerns. This apparently harmless gas may have a severe impact on the environment, on nature and on the coming generations. The resolution we have adopted therefore takes a cautious approach and introduces a moratorium. However, we will have to return to the question to assess the environmental effects.

 Madam President, with this report Parliament is recognising how quickly the consumer credit market is changing. The financial crisis is also a credit crisis and the massive reduction in loans granted to families affects businesses and the whole economy. If the Commission could intervene to increase access to cross-border credit, which is currently too low, accounting for only 2 % of total credit in the EU, many Europeans who are currently unable to obtain loans in their own countries because of the economic problems of those countries could obtain them in other Member States, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of the single market for which the European institutions are fighting so hard to overcome national boundaries.

 Madam President, I am expressing my opinion and my vote in favour of the matter under discussion because the burgeoning of means of payment and the widespread use of ‘e-money’ demand rules that reflect the times and that reconcile the drive towards greater openness to the internal market with the need for transparency. There are some positive aspects to this, which have an impact on the fight against laundering money from unlawful activities and on tax evasion, which is an unfortunate feature of many Member States. However, we need to look at this in greater detail. I think it is essential that we understand the potential problems that multilateral interchange fees could cause as regards competitiveness, with costs and surcharges that discourage greater use of e-money, and some hidden interchange fees that could do the opposite of making for an open, competitive and transparent market system.

 – Madam President, I voted in favour of the Costa report against the wishes of my group, and I wanted to explain why this was. I believe the report covers most aspects of the fight against threats to children from the digital world. Protecting children is an urgent matter in a changing technological world, where family, schools and the education system are not always taking the necessary measures to prevent its harmful effects. There is plenty to do, but it was the positive aspects of this report that made me vote for it. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of the text adopted today, which stems from the Commission Communication of 2011 on Social Business Initiative. The Europe 2020 strategy lies ahead, and with it we will need to provide answers to the ever-increasing need for social services, for example in the health and nursing sectors, and to estimate the demographic trend we have to deal with. However, this must be accompanied by a high degree of innovation and experimentation, the success or failure of which is a matter for the European institutions to evaluate within a set timescale, so we can see whether this initial approach could bring about improvements and can continue to develop this type of enterprise effectively in the longer term. We need to bear in mind that the nature of this type of business is very specific, having to reconcile economic growth with solidarity. For this reason I voted in favour, so that this constructive approach can be a basic pillar of a new society that reclaims the meaning and value of a job where humans are central to society in a new, integrated kind of humanism.

 As rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I actively assisted in drafting the macro-regional strategy for the Mediterranean. I see it as a territorial cooperation tool that will achieve greater synergy between the various intervention instruments through multi-level governance. In this respect, the strategy for the Mediterranean may hinge on the need to develop an integrated maritime transport system covering the whole Mediterranean basin and the development of renewable energy. A fundamental issue that I have worked for in this dossier is to address the island question at a European level and to ask the EU institutions to implement Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union by adopting an ad hoc
 strategy that takes account of the handicaps faced by islands. Another feature of the dossier is the provision that the Commission, in collaboration with the forthcoming Cypriot Presidency of the EU, will adopt a strategic plan for islands that creates the conditions for economic growth in these territories while ensuring their full territorial continuity. A particularly significant point is the call for the Commission to adopt measures, such as increasing the threshold for de minimis
 aid for islands in the transport, agriculture and fishery sectors, which will make the islands equally competitive with the mainland territories. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Mr President, I, together with the Italian Italia dei Valori
 delegation, have backed the introduction of the Tobin tax, a financial speculation tax, since 2010. Today, Parliament voted in favour of introducing this tax, which we believe to be an essential tool to ensure that the financial sector assumes its responsibilities and is steered back towards the real economy. As far as we are concerned, the introduction of a European financial transaction tax (FTT) reasserts the supremacy of democratic politics over the serious discrepancies in the functioning of the financial markets, which caused the economic crisis we are experiencing today. The FTT does away with the exemption from tax on financial transactions and makes financial speculators responsible in the same way as ordinary citizens, who have to pay taxes even on bread and petrol on a daily basis. With expected revenues of over EUR 50 billion a year, the European Parliament is today sending a signal that it is taking responsibility, in order to create more solidarity in the world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I voted in favour of the own-initiative report on regional airports, and I am sure it will serve as a basis for their further regulation. This report shows the importance that the European Parliament attributes to these airports in the context of air transport and the important role that they play as a vehicle for territorial, economic and social cohesion within the European Union. For the first time, the definition of a regional airport has been provided and an attempt has been made to limit the area of reference by sub-dividing regional airports into major and minor airports, also in relation to passenger throughput and the links provided by such airports. It is certainly to be hoped that the Commission will then follow up with more stringent specifications for their definition. A special passage concerns recognition of the need to guarantee public service obligations for remote regions, islands and the outermost regions, as we are well aware of their handicap in terms of participation in the single market. Finally, I believe that the definition establishing and specifying the negative view of the irrational proliferation of further regional airports is useful. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal to amend the provisions on risk-sharing instruments is extremely timely for those Member States at risk of suffering great difficulties as a result of the current financial instability. Its arrival during this period of serious economic crisis is perfect. Hence, in this amendment to the regulation on risk-sharing instruments, countries such as Ireland, Portugal, Hungary, Romania, Lithuania and above all Greece will find an alternative to the threat of losing funds already assigned and therefore the chance to carry on with programmes cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund that are proving difficult to implement in these Member States. This will result in the projects being carried out and jobs being retained across the parts of the European Union most affected by the economic crisis, without eating into the EU’s budget in any way but instead making a major contribution to growth in Europe.

 I voted in favour of Mr Taylor’s own-initiative report because it calls on the Commission to intervene both to enforce existing legislation and to promote and simplify the use of the instruments that protect air passenger rights. This report emphasises the legal certainty of passengers’ rights, their right to information, and the independence and operational transparency of the independent enforcement bodies that can impose penalties for infringements and resolve disputes between passengers and the industry. All too often, passengers find that they are the victims of the abusive practices of air carriers, which take advantage of passengers’ lack of information about their own rights in order to delay or cancel flights arbitrarily without accepting the liability that they should accept by law. I hope, therefore, that this report can provide useful suggestions for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, which is expected to take place next year.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a picture of Rossella Urru, the young Sardinian woman kidnapped in Algeria on 23 October along with two Spanish colleagues during a cooperation mission to help the poorest inhabitants of the Maghreb. Rossella is a young woman who has dedicated her life to a noble occupation, namely helping people in need. The young woman’s family, the Italian nation, and all of us eagerly await her release and the release of all European citizens who are hostages or have been abducted. Rossella is a young European citizen, a standard-bearer of our values, and that is why she must return home. That is why I am calling for the foreign service and our High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, to redouble their diplomatic efforts to ensure that Rossella can regain her freedom and return home.

 Mr President, the milk and milk products sector has been undergoing a terrible crisis for some years now, but there are internal imbalances that this report and its amendment – which I supported from the start – will determine to a lesser extent, by influencing how it works and putting an end to these internal imbalances, or at least remedying them in part together with other instruments. This measure has been produced by the working group set up by Mr Cioloş, which produced some instruments for restoring balance to the added value for all operators in the supply chain. In specific terms, the terms and conditions of contracts will have determined characteristics of form, requirements and duration, which will mainly be useful to producers. One important element will concern raw milk processed in less favoured areas (LFAs), mountainous areas, intermediate areas and islands, where any transfer of milk from areas which are not LFAs must be authorised in advance.

 Madam President, I voted for the report by Mr Fleckenstein because I am fully convinced that an Agency as important as the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) must have a regulation that specifies clear, precise duties, and highlights the effective division of tasks between EMSA, the European Commission and the Member States. All too often we are witness to accidents that pollute our seas, which are under constant threat also from the rise in the transport of dangerous goods and materials by sea, often in maritime areas protected by special rules due to their naturalistic importance, such as the Bocche di Bonifacio. In this regard, I particularly appreciated the rapporteur’s focus on development of the CleanSeaNet service and the SaveSeaNet network. The text was very balanced despite being multi-faceted, recognising the need to define EMSA’s tasks also by taking on more staff, without putting too much pressure on the budget, and underlining the importance of innovative tools such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme (GMES), while also launching a positive message on support in the sector for gender equality policies.

I would particularly like to thank him for the welcome references to the new guidelines on the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), which will animate the future legal debate, and for recognising the value of innovative instruments such as Galileo, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and Global Monitoring for Environment and Safety (GMES.) However, I am sorry that some aspects of fundamental importance in creation of a real Single European Transport Area were not adequately explored. More specifically, the insular nature of many European countries has not been investigated in sufficient detail, particularly with regard to the regulations that apply to them in terms of their obligations to provide public transport, which are currently muddled and difficult to describe as far as the various modes of transport are concerned. Lastly, I found the text did not sufficiently cover the issue of transporting hazardous goods, which needs to be properly dealt with and regulated, both in order to avoid terrible accidents, and in order to manage accidents once they have happened, including in terms of the liability of the entities involved, institutions or otherwise.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was among those who signed the alternative resolution on the health of honeybees, because the report put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) completely rejected the recommendations indicated in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) opinion, for which I was a shadow rapporteur. The plague inflicted upon bees is a problem which is becoming more and more serious, and there is plenty of scientific confirmation to show the damage caused by pesticides and monocultures. In order to understand this, we only have to think of areas of the world, for instance certain valleys in China, where pollination is now carried out by hand precisely as a result of uninhibited overuse of particular types of pesticides over time. Yet, the report approved today by the European Parliament has not taken a stance on this topic. We lack a critical objective on the toxicity of pesticides, specifically, the prohibition of systematic neurotoxins; we lack indications for the beekeeping sector relating to contamination of honey produce by GMO crops; we lack a critique on monoculture; and we lack the idea that large-scale changes are required in agriculture, including crop rotation, to reduce the use of pesticides, with a view to reversing the sharp decline in the production of pollinators.

 Mr President, in order to evaluate the report adopted today, we need to start by extrapolating two fundamental facts: the fact that the number of dependent people with disabilities will supposedly double by 2050, and the fact that, at the moment, we do not have a sufficient amount of data to gauge the severity of the problem. The challenge being addressed by means of this Disability Strategy 2010-2020 is to allow people with disabilities not only to enjoy human rights, just like everyone else, but also to ensure that those rights can be put into practice effectively. It is therefore essential to bring out disabled people’s full potential by encouraging them to train, providing them with freedom of movement and enabling them to access the labour market: by so doing, we will also be able to combat one of the biggest problems that adds to the misfortune of these people, namely, poverty.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the Green Paper on the modernisation of public procurement policy for two reasons in particular. Firstly, identification of the most economically advantageous tender which takes into account the entire life-cycle costs of the relevant goods, works or services and therefore not just the lowest price – a common, widespread consideration in all countries and all contracting authorities – which will improve quality, and, at the same time, place greater emphasis on the environmental and social sustainability of goods and services. Secondly, simplification, which will be achieved through greater flexibility, and which will allow for simpler procedures and offer small and medium-sized enterprises greater opportunities in the awarding of contracts. I would add, in particular, that in this regard, we should promote electronic procurement, which currently accounts for less than five per cent of all public procurement in the EU, and that the publication of calls for tender, divided into lots, will enable greater transparency when it comes to participation in tenders.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the whole package of six measures, this one therefore included, because they represent a fundamental transition towards true European governance. We are doing this in order to take responsibility and bring budgets under control, even where national governments, the governments of Member States, have failed to do so. This is, moreover, the moment at which the credibility of our institutions, of European institutions, is at stake. Europe is taking upon itself the duty of making its citizens’ demands its own and of securing that stability, that government in order to create the conditions for growth, without which there would not have been and could not now be a future for our citizens and especially for new generations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Ms Goulard on having tackled and completed such a difficult text: it too is a fundamental step in the direction of European governance. It is also a practical move on the part of Parliament to take forward the statements we have heard again today in plenary, but which are often not acted on. This is the specific call, I repeat, that we are also making to President Barroso, because everyone agrees when a statement of principle is made. There was agreement when the Commission’s programme was adopted in this House, but it needs to be implemented. This report is a specific step towards the implementation of that programme. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Haglund again here on the work he has done. I voted in favour of it, and in fact I welcome the entire package. The report introduces penalties for macroeconomic imbalances, but it should be said that those penalties are to be imposed only if Member States demonstrate an unwillingness to adopt the necessary corrective policies, because, if the finance situation does not improve, Mr De Angelis, there can be no prospect of growth, or no prospect of satisfactory and meaningful growth, anyway. For that reason I believe that the package that has been adopted today will serve as a basis for the growth that the Member States as a whole must in fact aim for. If we stop here, we will definitely not have achieved the objectives that we are setting ourselves, but in taking this step we will certainly be able to achieve that other objective. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation that we have adopted on the prevention of macroeconomic imbalances among the 27 countries is certainly a departure from the previous situation. It establishes rules and checks and, in particular, it introduces the concept of symmetry, which means that the Commission must assess not only deficits, but also surpluses. In practice, contrary to the commonly held view that there a few bad countries, such as Greece or Italy, countries such as Germany and the Netherlands are also being placed under supervision due to their overly low levels of domestic consumption. Furthermore, the regulation has an essentially federalist outlook and hence stresses the notion of fairness, which we believe is one of the positive elements that characterise the future of Europe and of the Member States – fairness and solidarity, which will be the preconditions for European growth. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out, now that we have reached the conclusion a year after the proposal was first tabled, that the Feio report reviews the Stability and Growth Pact and hence finally establishes a check requiring States with a debt/GDP ratio of more than 60% to achieve a 5% reduction. It does so by laying down and clarifying the debt criterion and the procedures on the pace that has to be followed. The Commission will have to consider a range of factors in this global economic context before assessing and making its recommendations to the Member State concerned. The report introduces the fundamental principle that reducing one’s debt means paying less interest and therefore being able to spend more on investment and growth, which is the real objective on which we will have to focus over the next few months.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, more than a year ago now, when the initial problems in the Greek economy, and then in the economies of other countries, began to emerge, I was interviewed by the European channel. One of the points I raised was precisely the attention paid to the statistical data that allowed some countries to fiddle their accounts. The Ford report, which we have voted on and approved today, by contrast lays down criteria on the transparency and independence of national statistical authorities, with penalties for those who commit forgery and fraud. It is a fundamental report, in that it aims to prevent a lack of transparency in the compilation of statistical data and ensures that those data are uniform. This will enable the European institutions and the governments of all the countries to proceed uniformly, in other words to have criteria that are not only based on knowledge but which are also uniform in terms of the actions carried out.

 Madam President, Commissioner Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased, and first of all, therefore, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Gardini, and the shadow rapporteurs for their fruitful collaboration on such a highly topical and extremely important dossier as this. As I was saying, we are pleased with the balanced, rational approach adopted in the report, which perfectly takes account of the principle of subsidiarity and the idea of a solidarity clause, which should guide the Member States’ actions in their response to disasters and in their civil protection role. Specifically, I believe it is necessary to develop a predictable, pre-planned system within the European Union’s Civil Protection Mechanism that is in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity. In other words, it must not involve setting up a supranational body, which would be liable to duplicate costs and powers without any assurance that it would work efficiently. I particularly welcome the attention devoted to extremely vulnerable areas such as islands, which is clearly expressed throughout the body of the report, as well as the emphasis on the link between disaster preparation, prevention and response, which make up an inseparable trio. Lastly, I am pleased to see how sensitively other Members have addressed the subject of major regional threats, which I believe deserves our attention; in particular, there have been many references to actions and strategies targeting forest fires. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted overall in favour of Mr Koch’s report because I agree with its targeted approach inasmuch as it asks the Commission for a concrete, circumstantiated commitment to road safety, including the development of the proposed models into a fully-fledged new action plan. The plan must incorporate a set of detailed measures, with clear timetables and monitoring instruments to assess the progress made, as well as a mid-term review. Conversely, I did not wish to support the idea of appointing an EU road safety coordinator, which, in my view, would be likely to duplicate powers and generate an excessively bureaucratic mechanism. Of course, it seems obvious that achieving the target of halving road accident victims by 2020 would also require a financial commitment that currently appears to be difficult to achieve. In conclusion, however, I regret the fact that the Committee on Transport and Tourism was not bold or ambitious enough to accept a complete harmonisation of important road safety rules, such as standardising the EU direction of travel in the United Kingdom and Malta as well, as I proposed in an amendment which the committee chose not to accept.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe I wish to express my satisfaction with the work that has been carried out. It is an historic step in the institutional evolution of Europe following the Treaty of Lisbon that for the first time competences are assigned to Parliament and the Commission in relation to tourism, which is the third component of the economy and of employment in Europe. First of all, I would like to stress that the text that is being put to the House today sets out a comprehensive governance that stems from Europe 2020 strategy and develops a series of proposals to achieve growth that is smart, sustainable and inclusive in every sense. Accordingly, it suggests specific programming instruments such as strategies for macro-regions, interregionality and joint and complementary planning. At times like these, when governance loses its bearings, we know what the negative effects are. Here, on the other hand, the dossier traces a very precise path. Out of these plans and instruments, I wish to call to mind the extraordinary plan to foster a progressive reduction in the seasonal nature of tourism, set out in paragraph 63 of the report. From the point of view of a European economy that, unfortunately, is losing a large share of industrial output, tourism can and must represent an important factor for overall growth, above all if the main public and private players can create an integrated approach between the different policies of the sector, the various financial instruments and build tourism into a real system that brings together the various economic sectors: agriculture, industry, craft, transport, services, and so on. I should mention that the text being voted upon contains numerous references to islands and remote areas which represent, as I was saying at the outset, a tangible way of achieving, through appropriate financial instruments, the criterion of inclusion sought by Europe 2020 strategy. Ladies and gentlemen, the tourism sector is also characterised by sustainable growth in environmental and social terms, which supports SMEs for which we have provided a business incubator tool, for innovation by way of supplying knowledge tools that will enable them to achieve, and the tourist to obtain, better travel solutions. Further, beyond the specific actions already put forward by the Commission I must give credit to Commissioner Tajani for the particular attention paid to SMEs and micro-enterprises, which must be singled out. In the report, they are regarded as guaranteeing innovation from the bottom up and they are expressly recognised as fulfilling the function of ensuring the quality, variety and authenticity of the different regions. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the compromise reached between Parliament and the European Council, European consumers will now be able to know where the meat on their table comes from. My amendment, which is taken up in the institutional compromise, was undoubtedly more ambitious and required more extensive marking of the origin and provenance of other products too – not just of meat, but of milk, dairy products in general and meat used as an ingredient in food. Nevertheless, it is satisfying to know that a road map has been established that will see the Commission present a specific report on this issue in two and three years’ time. The report will therefore include proposals to ensure the increased – not to say full – protection of all Europeans in the near future. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on which we voted today regarding European Union legislation on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, known as ‘mad cow disease’, testifies to the excellence of the European policies that have been adopted to protect human and animal health. The number of cases has certainly diminished in recent years, and this enables us to apply less alarming countermeasures, hence, for example, where a case appears in a herd, it is now possible to avoid culling the entire herd, but to use the milk produced until it is fully depleted. We all remember with great concern the images of entire herds slaughtered if one animal had contracted the disease, and that is something that we shall now avoid. We must, however, continue to be vigilant, Madam President, because the text we have adopted today introduces a considerable risk to health and opens the way to free use of animal meal. In this regard, we must remain vigilant. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE
).

Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Lepage for her determined work in bringing this dossier to a positive conclusion. I have been a staunch supporter of this report throughout, partly because I think it gives real legal value to the text we have adopted and also because it fills a legislative vacuum that has given rise to serious legal dispute between enterprises, public bodies and citizens. This measure avoids the colonisation of the Member States, leaving them free to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of genetically modified organisms. The amendments that this text brings in will therefore allow the individual Member States to ban the cultivation of GMOs due to the impact they may have on the agricultural system, particularly with regard to biodiversity, but also with regard to pesticide resistance, to the invasiveness of certain crops and, therefore, to the protection of our territories. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, the report by Mr Pieper on the post-2013 cohesion policy reduces the effects of a two-speed Europe. Indeed, only uniform growth can ensure proper cohesion between our territories and overall unity, even in diversity. I voted in favour of the text because it introduces an intermediate category, which allows may European regions to continue to benefit from the same amount of structural funds as they have done so far. The lack of efficient programming for the use of European funds has unfortunately resulted in many regions being unable to make proper use of the resources made available by the European Union, thereby risking a majority of the funds being left unused. Here, however, Brussels is sending out a positive message. We hope that our regions will know how to interpret and use the funds in the best possible way. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE
),

I voted in favour of the identification of new parameters more representative of a country’s progress, and not just its consumption, although I think more should be done. The report in question has had a long and difficult journey, and finally made it to the plenary session having lost much of its content along the way. Parliament should have put forward a proposal taking into account factors including education, health and personal activities, but it confined itself to highlighting the need to establish new parameters, delegating the task of defining them to the Commission. Gross domestic product is an outdated indicator based on economic principles that, by reducing quality to quantity, overlook the meaning of things and individual and collective well-being, undervalue work in itself compared to the object of production, and consider only the production of new objects, not maintenance.

Mr President, as shadow rapporteur of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am completely satisfied with the outcome of today’s vote. The report by Mr Arsenis on the protection of forests is a policy report; it is a basis for confirming how the European Parliament intends to tackle the protection of our forest heritage and the adaptation of forests to climate change. Today, the European Parliament clearly expressed its point of view, in the light of which we expect the Commission to make the necessary proposals and so enable even more detailed policies to be drafted for the sector. I would particularly like to thank Mr Arsenis for his expert and professional work, which involved a long and difficult debate, because – as we are well aware – the forest situation is not the same in all the Member States. Despite this, we found common ground and also achieved some specific objectives, for example, the protection of certain parts from land speculation, greater protection of forests which are prized for their biodiversity, such as the northern Boreal and Mediterranean forests, and a ban on building on land cleared by arson. Mr President, as I have said, this is very important for many Mediterranean countries, including your own country, Greece. Giommaria Uggias,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has endorsed my recommendation for discharge to be granted to the European transport agencies, which support the European Commission. The discharge is granted because the Court of Auditors deemed that the annual accounts of the agencies were substantially reliable, although we must take note of and underscore a number of critical issues. Some of these issues are common to all the agencies or some of them, including for example: cancellations and delays in procurement procedures, failure to observe Staff Regulations, or the violation of the principle of budgetary annuality. These agencies’ commitment to overcome said problems should, however, be highlighted. In general terms, I should like to make two brief political observations, namely the lack of any multiannual programming – which is symptomatic of a leadership deficit – and the dearth of incisiveness in the work of some agencies, such as the European Railway Agency. In the same vein, I should like to note the delay – some two years after the fact – in setting up procedures to determine responsibility for the Viareggio disaster. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are taking a step forward in understanding that this is not a problem linked to some areas of Europe, Southern Europe or North Africa. However, my view of the measure is a positive one. I would like to ask Mr Tarabella whether he or the Commission does not think that the problem of application to veterinary services should also be tackled immediately, so that there could be a measure which would make it possible to eliminate the problem throughout the European Union. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important measure for the agricultural world. However, the measure needs to be followed up immediately by a commitment from the Council and national governments to adopt it forthwith, before the end of the season, in order to solve this problem which does not affect just the southern part of Europe, but the whole of Europe, as today’s vote has shown. Bluetongue affects the sheep and cattle on our farms. Therefore, taking action to totally eradicate it is a health policy objective which national governments can best contribute to through this measure by being flexible. It also needs to be immediately adopted through transposition of the directive. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian delegation from Italia dei Valori 
voted against the text of the resolution on nuclear power, because it was not clear enough to indicate a clear no to nuclear power. Unfortunately, all the amendments that could have improved the text and chosen a Europe free of nuclear power, immediately free of existing nuclear power stations and with no future nuclear power stations, were rejected. A Europe free of nuclear power is the only possible route if we want to guarantee that our children and future generations will have a future protected from the repetition of catastrophes like Fukushima and Chernobyl. These lessons tell us that there is no such thing as theoretical safety. That is why we have to say a clear no to the nuclear option and invest in research and innovation in other sources that are truly green, renewable and clean. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I worked as shadow rapporteur on this dossier and so could not but vote in favour, together with my group. I did so believing it to be a very useful tool for the development of a sector that will be a driving force for the European economy. Industry is moving away from Europe; agriculture suffers from serious deficiencies; meanwhile, tourism is one area that can certainly offer prospects for employment, economic development and intelligent, inclusive and compatible growth. To this end, the instrument we have approved today, which allows for more modern data gathering, processing, treatment and transmission than the previous situation, will surely give impetus to this activity. This is why the ALDE Group and I have voted in favour. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measure we have voted on today is of some help in clarifying the phenomenon of migration flows and praises the work of Frontex. I think this should be seen positively and therefore so should the result of the vote. I do, however, believe that this stance should be accompanied by equal clarity on the part of the Member States, because this challenge affects not only the European Institutions but also policy in the Member States. I must say, however, that so far not all Member States have implemented and practiced such clarity, starting with the policy of the Italian Government, which has dealt with the situation in Lampedusa in a most objectionable and questionable manner. Thousands of migrants there have been essentially abandoned to their fate, whilst human solidarity – never mind legal solidarity – would have led to immediate care and certainly greater respect than has been shown, notwithstanding the fact that the legal problem would then have to be dealt with, as we have done in this House.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a staunch supporter of the anti-nuclear cause I backed this report not only because I think the decommissioning of these plants is of benefit to all, but also because I hope that no more will be able to be built. Today we are faced with a ticking time-bomb across Europe. The operation of nuclear power plants for civilian purposes is founded on engineering practices which are now outdated and anachronistic. It can be said that their safety is ever more theoretical: everything will be fine, as long as nothing happens. In fact, we are dealing with protocols from 50 years ago which, in reality, are not protected against events that may be increasingly unforeseeable. Terrorist attacks could not have been foreseen and nor could the natural and disastrous events – not only earthquakes – which unfortunately are increasingly frequent in our disaster-stricken world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the committee Chair, Brian Simpson, for leading the work of the committee and work on the file, and, above all, for having allowed its conclusion – at least I hope so because the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) will be voting for this – and approval on first reading, and hence the successful conclusion of the regulation. This task actually involves reviewing the regulation, which sets out to establish a common framework for the collection of statistics on tourism and, more specifically, for all its stages, ranging from the collection to the processing, treatment and transmission of statistics, enabling optimum knowledge of the financial world that is activated and revolves around tourism. Mr President, it is clear that, since the 1995 directive, which is the predecessor of this directive, remarkable growth has been recorded in tourism and we must acknowledge, in particular, the great prospects that the economic system of tourism will contribute to the European economy as a whole in the near future. I worked on the file as a shadow rapporteur for the ALDE Group and, as I said earlier, we are going to vote in favour of it. I think the Simpson report will be particularly popular due to the notion of tourism satellite accounts, namely, the adoption of pilot projects that will make it possible to assess the economic impact on individual sectors of the economy, in other words, aspects relating to same-day visits, the evaluation report to be drawn up every five years and the possibility, indeed the necessity, of a five-yearly report to assess the effects of statistics. I will conclude by saying that this is part of the new responsibility arising out of the Treaty of Lisbon and I think this time, we are beginning to assume the responsibilities of Parliament effectively and we will do the same with the next file being worked on, soon to arrive in this Chamber. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we were delighted to adopt the measures proposed by Mrs Podimata. For those of us in the Italian delegation of the Italia dei Valori
 party within the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, this was a moment of great satisfaction, because it shows that Parliament knows how to follow up its statements of principle. In fact, as early as the debate on the report by Mrs Berès on the financial, economic and social crisis, we had argued in favour of a tax on financial transactions. This was done today, so we are delighted to declare that we voted in favour because this tax will shift financial resources from the financial economy – and therefore away from financial speculation – to the real economy. The tax will also respond to the Millennium Development Goals and contribute to large European projects in infrastructure, research, ecological restructuring and in our system of production.

 Mr President, the resolution adopted today has established important principles for the protection of consumers, increasing safeguards against the spread of falsified medicinal products. This is an extremely dangerous phenomenon, and one of the most significant remedies has been to stem the online sale of medicines of dubious origin. Moreover, through the adoption of a number of guarantees, we will establish strict regulations that require permits and inspections. This does not, however, mean that forms of health protection and medical prescriptions are cancelled out. It must be remembered that the legislative power of Member States is unaffected in this respect and that they may retain or limit the ban on the online sales of drugs within their territory. This is an opportunity for Member States to better regulate the matter, but we must remember, Mr President, that citizens can order medicines from another Member State and that this regulation should not be seen as another opportunity to benefit the pharmaceutical industry. Instead we must continue to progress along the trail of liberalisation that the EU is currently blazing by adopting measures such as this. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Cancian on his excellent work in bringing this measure to its conclusion. Mr Mastella will allow me to disagree with him on the idea that this measure represents a great victory for our citizens. One cannot but note that citizens are only protected if they travel further than 250 km by coach or bus. Where is the protection for the rights of citizens of Europe if – as Mrs Meissner has already stressed – entire States such as Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are excluded from this protection? These are the reasons why our group abstained in the vote. We did not vote against the report because some rights are protected, such as those of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. That is why we abstained. As for the rest of it, we would ask to return to the issue as soon as possible in order to really protect our citizens. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Madam President, when, a century ago, Antonio Meucci’s patent was not recognised by the American telephony industry, it was not because of a lack of English or his use of Italian, but instead the failure to meet a condition: he did not have the money to register his patent for another year. In a similar vein, we are now in a paradoxical situation and, quite apart from the vote, I think that the fact that a trilingual patent system is to be adopted, which excludes Italian, is basically a sign of the weakness of our government, its inability to make its voice heard in European politics, and the weakness of our political system, which reflects, above all, on research and innovation. On this issue, we need only recall the competitiveness study published last December, which shows that in recent years, Italy has willingly handed over EUR 4 billion to other countries that have welcomed our researchers. These researchers certainly no longer have any need for Italian, since they have learnt English, French and German and have all the tools required to submit these patents, to the detriment of Italian products.

Madam President, I mostly support the amendments proposed through this text, which in any case essentially does nothing more than codify previous legislation regarding the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and animal feedingstuffs. We are forgetting and letting it pass somewhat unnoticed that we are talking about waste from nuclear accidents. This means that we have to continue to pay close attention to the risks of nuclear plants and to the fact that these are the consequences of the rotten and poisonous results of what, in certain States, we insist on developing. It is therefore a measure that must inspire us all to be as vigilant as possible. Getting to the heart of the matter, I do, however, think that more could be done to bring in compulsory immediate notification, which would allow all risk factors to be dealt with together. Furthermore, there should be no way to avoid the requirement to notify government authorities in the event of an accident. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we have adopted the resolution on waste in Campania, which should be a lesson to us all to prevent environmental disasters like this from happening. We can feel pleased with ourselves today, because in this plenary we have adopted a measure like this, which makes a culture of recycling and reuse at a time of globalisation a measure to be promoted and encouraged in every possible way to ensure that European citizens, who are now free from the effort of producing the goods that are now within everyone’s reach, are aware of their real value. Mr Florenz’s report on the reuse of electrical and electronic equipment, on which we are voting today, is important not only for the future of environmental sustainability in Europe, but also for another aspect: the loss of raw materials. In fact, the efficient and innovative use of materials and resources is a key issue in the globalised economy. I therefore consider it positive that we have set ourselves ambitious targets and also that the actual cost of a product should be indicated in such a way that consumers become aware of it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent weeks, the various parliamentary committees that are dealing with the issue of the common agricultural policy have been looking into the matter of the post-2013 reform. Clearly, food security is one of the fundamental elements of agriculture. This consideration must therefore be viewed in the light of the report being put to the vote today, in which food security is defined as a fundamental right that must accordingly be safeguarded in every possible way. Such attention is required, Mr President, whenever there is an emergency, such as that linked to the dioxin scandal that we are witnessing at the moment, with the discovery that dioxin is being used in animal feed, but also, and above all, to ensure that we have a common production process that respects the production sector as a whole, that respects the quality of farmers’ work, the environment and marketing, and hence, that respects consumers. This report forms part of a set of measures that this House has developed to promote agriculture, and I can therefore say that I am satisfied. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is one of the pillars of the European Union. There is no doubt that, under the same general conditions, enterprises can produce and sell their products and services without public support, but not all sectors and not all areas are operating under conditions of parity. It is therefore fair, as in this instance, to correct situations of economic disadvantage and allow productive businesses to remain on the market and maintain employment levels, as in Sulcis for example, where 500 families would have found themselves without work, without income and without dignity. We must realise that when we speak of coal, we are talking about areas that have no alternative to mines and should be allowed the opportunity to adopt production technologies that are competitive and compatible with the free market and with the environment. Logically, postponing the deadline to 2018 must represent an imperative to ensure that institutions and companies take immediate action to develop technological, financial and environmental compatibility conditions that are in line with the challenges that await us.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, 14 February, is European Epilepsy Day. This is a condition from which 6 million European citizens suffer, of whom some 300 000 are Italians. It is therefore important that associations, including the Italian Epilepsy Association, dedicated to increase awareness of such a serious condition about which there is still much ignorance, a lack of clear information and regarding which many extremely delicate aspects remain unknown, should organise meeting opportunities over this period. Some steps forward have been made in the last few years at European level, especially through a 2009 directive, but there is still much to do, especially to guarantee full civil rights to sufferers from this condition in the world of work and of mobility, and in guaranteeing the availability of medication during school hours. I therefore consider days of reflection on such fundamental aspects of these problems to be very important. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the waste crisis in Campania, which was adopted by a majority today, is a very important sign. The emergency in Campania has become a European emergency, and that is a decision in favour of the people of Campania. We are saying ‘no’ to the disbursement of funds that are used simply to strengthen corrupt politicians, unscrupulous businessmen and organised crime; ‘yes’ to European money if a credible, environmentally friendly waste plan is put forward; ‘no’ to uncontrolled landfill in national parks; ‘no’ to dioxin-producing incinerators; and ‘yes’ to recycling and environmentally friendly methods. We are also saying ‘no’ to the criminalisation of dissent in local communities, and therefore ‘yes’ to legality. It is an important turning point and a warning to the Berlusconi Government and the regional government run by Stefano Caldoro, which so far have done nothing but talk and bolster up their cliques and the Mafia establishment. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
). 
 – (IT)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the lies told by the Berlusconi government, which assumed office in 2008 telling Italians that the waste problem had been resolved, the European Union is doing the right thing by refusing to grant Italy funding until an environmentally friendly waste system based on recycling of waste and composting has been presented. That system is certainly not provided for by Mr Caldoro’s plan, which is based once again on uncontrolled landfills such as the ones at Chiaiano, Taverna del Re and Terzigno – the Terzigno landfill is actually inside Vesuvius National Park – nor by incinerators, which cause death, cancers and full-blown health crises. In the 13 years that the environmental crisis has been going on, public funds in Campania have strengthened the criminal links between politicians, both on the left and on the right, businessmen and the Camorra. Furthermore, environmental issues are not resolved by criminalising dissent or by criminalising local communities, families and the region, as the Italian Government has done by using batons to restrain anyone who defends the environment and the land.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that if we can now talk about a reduction in errors, we owe this to the skill, independence and professionalism of the Court of Auditors, and I should like President Caldeira to take note of this. I believe that, as well as the Commission, Parliament played an important part in this improvement, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control, which sets great store by the subject of transparency and the effective and efficient use of public funds. We must still see what we can do to improve, however, because there are still too many things that are not right, particularly in very sensitive sectors such as agriculture and cohesion, with often worrying error rates in sectors where fraud in areas such as contracts and over-invoicing is rife. I believe that it is necessary to lower the rate of bureaucracy and reduce pointless red tape and instead introduce a few clear rules to send out a very clear and determined ‘no’ to every form of fraud in sectors where corruption is endemic. Another important factor is to step up the role of OLAF, the anti-fraud office, to combat all forms of fraud and corruption. Another aspect that we cannot fail to emphasise – we learned this also from a recent visit by the Committee on Budgetary control to Italy – is that there is also a risk of the forceful influence of organised crime and forms of corruption on public funds. The role of OLAF could therefore be essential from this viewpoint, together with greater cooperation between Member States, the Commission and Parliament. Another absolutely essential point is that I believe the Commission must strengthen its independence from Member States. I believe that we must block funds to prevent repetition of this type of behaviour, particularly in states where serious errors – I am not talking about minor errors – and very substantial episodes of fraud have been going on for years. The credibility level of the European Parliament and the European institutions is determined greatly by the level of transparency and correctness with which public funds are spent. I therefore believe that we have room for improvement on this score. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find President Sarkozy’s decision to be very serious: once again, in an effort to conceal internal political problems – as has already happened in Italy – he is attempting to regain support by criminalising outsiders and migrants, playing on people’s anxieties over social safety. Before Europe becomes the Europe of markets, it must be the Europe of rights, the Europe of solidarity and the Europe of inclusion. This is why President Sarkozy’s statement was immediately followed by the very serious statement by the Italian Minister for the Interior, who wishes to adopt the Sarkozy method and extend it to EU citizens, expelling them without incomes or homes. Therefore, rather than promoting inclusion policies, policies that reduce social inequalities and seek to unite people, the aim is once again to criminalise people. This is very serious because migrants, outsiders, those who are considered to be on the fringes of society are useful when they are needed, for example, for illegal work; in other words, when they have duties to perform but no rights. If an outsider, a Roma or a migrant commits a crime, he is punished, but this must not be a pretext for justifying very serious expulsions. The Commission must react if it wants a Europe of solidarity, equality and freedom. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when building a Europe of rights, an essential part is played by freedom of information, pluralism of information and independence of information. Is the Commissioner aware that there is one country in the European Union – which is incidentally a founder member of the European Union under the Treaty of Rome – where there is no media pluralism, where a prime minister directly or indirectly controls the public and private TV and print media? What democratic electoral competition can exist in a country where a prime minister – a political party – controls the media? What democracy can exist in a country where a law that bans journalists from publishing judicial news is about to be approved in a matter of days? Forget about Watergate and the press upholding a regime! We are talking lapdogs here! What sort of democratic country wants to control the Internet? What sort of democratic country sidelines anyone who strays from the party line and fails to guarantee free speech and the right to dissent? We are not describing Sudan under Bokassa or Romania under Ceauşescu: this is Italy under Berlusconi, where such things are unfortunately allowed to happen, not least because the European Commission does not have the courage to adopt an independent and free stance with regard to the Member States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to highlight the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I proposed together with four other MEPs, and which half of the European Parliament, plus one, approved, with the aim of committing the Council and Commission to legislation that is truly effective in fighting corruption. I have returned from a visit to Greece on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control and one of the reasons behind the Greek structural crisis is certainly the squandering of public money, something which also occurs in Italy: Italy is eaten away by corruption, as we have recently seen. This corruption mainly hinges on the illegal management of public money, and the relationship between one political faction and a faction of businessmen and white-collar organised crime. It is important for the European Parliament to make its full pressure felt on the Commission and on Member States – Member States that do not conform should be penalised – and for the European institutions responsible for controlling corruption and the fight against organised crime to be strengthened. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recently, there has been yet another environmental disaster in Italy, on the River Lambro and the River Po. Also recently, the Court of Justice in Luxembourg condemned Italy for endangering public health with their illegal waste disposal and their inability to control the collection of waste in Campania. An increase in cases of leukaemia has been reported recently in Taranto through the Ilva steelworks, as well asbestos removal in schools in Crotone and dioxins in Campania. It is an ongoing environmental disaster. I strongly ask the Commission what it intends to do to ensure that the Italian Government falls in line with standards of the European Union directives, particularly with regard to the recent ruling by the Court of Justice, which strongly condemned Italy for not being able to dispose of waste in Campania. For many weeks and months, the city of Naples was a laughing stock all over the world. Luigi de Magistris,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome and thank the President of the Court of Auditors, with whom we have worked productively during this period. As Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I have always maintained that the role played by the Court of Auditors is fundamental. It is fundamental because the Court operates in a very sensitive sector, which people throughout the European Union watch with great interest and with a critical eye where the transparency, accuracy and legality of expenditure and of the management of public funds are concerned. I believe that it must be reiterated today that the Court should always be guaranteed independence and autonomy when carrying out its work because this is fundamental if we are to be able to evaluate properly and to make good decisions. Likewise, we ask the Court to put Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control in a position to carry out their own work as productively as possible. We must find the right balance which allows public funds to be spent effectively and efficiently, because these funds are aimed at important objectives such as economic development and job creation. At the same time, there must be severe punishments for serious irregularities and errors, which the Court has also uncovered in the last financial year, whilst an attempt must be made to avoid unnecessary formalities and red tape. As Mr Kallas was also saying, Parliament must strive to find an equilibrium in the tolerable risk of error. The report, which we have read with great interest, provides some insights, but also includes many grey areas. We must strive to achieve the best results regarding these grey areas. As my fellow Members have also mentioned, the main problems primarily concern the Structural and Cohesion Funds. It is true that the Court, in doing its job, points out errors and irregularities in relation to these funds. However, those who are able to look deeply into and to analyse matters can see that, behind the errors highlighted, there are even graver issues, as the judicial experiences of several countries in recent years demonstrate. There may be fraud, there may be deception. I am specifically referring to one or two errors revealed such as the contravention of rules on procurement, over-invoicing and so on. We must endeavour to make improvements in this area. I believe that the Commission should promote Member States which behave in a virtuous manner, and punish and penalise Member States which do comply with the rules. Furthermore, I believe it is very important for OLAF to use the Court of Auditors’ suggestions as a starting point and to further improve its work because it is in everyone’s interest that it does so. I think it is only through cooperation among various institutions, namely Parliament, the Court of Auditors and OLAF, that we will manage to safeguard the financial interests of all EU citizens.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I must acknowledge the very important work accomplished by the committee and the excellent job done by the rapporteur, as well as the political solidarity that has been on show. This is because, from the outset, we wished to send a very clear message: we intend to work with great rigour to ensure transparency, accuracy and legality in the management of public funds and, therefore, in auditing the budgets. Very significant progress has been made with the Council, which at first did not want to respond. I would like to personally congratulate the Swedish Presidency on this. It has always set out to act to promote transparency and accuracy. From that point of view, we therefore expect further progress, because obviously it is absolutely unacceptable, particularly with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, that Parliament should not have the information and details required to monitor budgets and public funds, in the interest not only of the European Union but also of all European citizens. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening’s very interesting debate has helped us to understand some very important points, particularly concerning the European Crime Prevention Network. Firstly, now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament’s role in the framework of codecision procedure must be increasingly enhanced, and in two ways. First, culture: organised crime and mafia organisations can be eliminated above all with information and awareness. A great Italian judge, Giovanni Falcone, who was murdered by the Mafia, used to say that the latter was a phenomenon that had a beginning and an end. The end must consist of a huge mobilisation in cultural terms, and it must start in Europe and in Parliament. A second point is that organised crime must be combated more effectively, above all with the introduction of the European public prosecution service, and I think also with the inclusion of certain very serious crimes, foreseen only in certain Member States. I am thinking, for instance, of mafia crimes. We must understand that the mafia crisis concerns the whole of Europe, since mafia organisations have the capacity to penetrate right through institutions as well. There is a very close relationship between mafia organisations and corruption, as recent reports have also emphasised, and fraud in the European Union, as we were recently told by the European Court of Auditors too. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that Parliament should be very concerned by the latest report from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation. Indeed, while some governments in the European Union, and most recently the Italian Government, continue to make immigration a criminal offence, violate the right to asylum and indiscriminately refuse entry, I believe that we need strong cooperation since it is a disgrace that the level of poverty described by the FAO in Africa, the Middle East and Asia still exists. Cooperation does not mean undertaking pointless projects which merely generate business for the same old companies, but helping these countries to emancipate themselves. Another disgrace which Parliament needs to address is the privatisation of water, something in which certain governments of the EU engage. Water is a resource that belongs to everyone, an essential resource and not a commodity at the service of the multinationals. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, I would like to talk about the tragedy in Messina – which the President of the European Parliament has recalled today – and its dozens of casualties. So another tragedy has been reported in Italy: the Italian Prime Minister has even claimed that it was a foreseeable tragedy. It may have been foreseeable, but nothing was done to prevent it. Nothing was done because the area is ruled by concrete, by the concrete mafia, by the forest mafia, with their forest fires. However, what the European Parliament should focus on above all is the way in which public money and also the aid allocated by the European Union can be invested in a different form of regional development, to ensure that construction work is carried out properly and the severe environmental damage that has been done can be rectified. More often than not, these public funds end up being pocketed by criminal societies, corrupt politicians and the Mafia. This legislative term must therefore focus on what happens to public funds, which should really be used to restore nature, to protect natural resources, to generate eco-friendly economic development and to create jobs. There must be no more horrific tragedies like the one in Messina. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important decision. The debate has become quite heated but that is because the industrial and employment situation in our countries is extremely difficult. This is an important decision in both real and symbolic terms, since we are dealing with a matter of principle. We must send out a sign of legality and respect in view of the all of the efforts being made by our business world. When I say ‘our world’, I do not mean it in a protectionist sense; I mean that the business community looks to the decision-making in Strasburg and Brussels with a feeling of belonging, searching for guarantees that only the Commission, Parliament, our institutions, can provide for fairer trade. However, we must tread cautiously: this is also a business world that looks at China as a great export opportunity, and that in certain sectors is actually managing to stay afloat precisely because of the market it has managed to develop in China. Thus we are not attempting to be protectionist and raise barricades. We simply do not want to be deceived, especially in an area such as photovoltaics, so crucial for our sustainable future. However, Commissioner, we must try to speed up this investigation so that any compensation can be estimated and claimed much sooner than planned. Moreover, since all of this debate is really about what to do in the wake of something that has already happened, we must also work on prevention. We should therefore strengthen the bilateral agreements to avoid any repeat of this kind of situation with China or other countries in future. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the list of tragedies in Cambodia is very long indeed: crimes against the environment, stratospheric corruption, waste of international aid, aggression against human rights activists, and a very shrewd dictator, who plays with democracy to give himself a semblance of legitimacy and who is still there. Now there is also the issue of the leader of the opposition, who is exiled from Cambodia. Yet I believe there is also another misfortune in that country, and that is an international community that is too obliging, and I have to say that that includes the European Union. Accompanying Graham Watson during our delegation’s visit to Cambodia, we felt that the Commission’s attitude was not sufficiently firm and robust. In Parliament, there is a robustness in the various debates on Cambodia that I would like to see in the other institutions too. Within the framework of European cooperation, I think it important to reflect on the case of Sam Rainsy who, among other things, won, through the efforts of the European People’s Party, an important human rights prize here in this institution. Perhaps that is the acid test, to try to have him return before the elections. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, well done to Russia for its accession to the World Trade Organisation, and I agree with the various boundaries set and the guidance given in the resolution. As a member of the delegation to the EU-Kazakhstan, EU-Kyrgyzstan and EU-Uzbekistan Parliamentary Cooperation Committees, and for relations with Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Mongolia, I would like to add something else that has not yet been mentioned in this debate, namely that Russia has made an effort to redraft its position both with respect to the WTO, and therefore the international community and particularly the Western nations and, through the Customs Union, with respect to the Eurasian countries. I believe we need to think carefully about the compatibility of the WTO and Russia’s accession to it, the new bilateral agreement being negotiated with Russia by the EU, and the Customs Union. I think this is one of the most complicated aspects. We do not yet know how the Customs Union will evolve, or whether as expected it will lead to a common economic area based on the four freedoms of movement that exist in the EU, but I believe that we should be taking an integrated approach to Russia on the one hand and Central Asia on the other. There is no point in creating antagonism between these two areas, bearing in mind the umbilical cord that links Russia with Central Asia. For example, we need to try to ensure that the Customs Union’s standards as regards safety and anti-trust rules are still in line with European standards, and I am also wondering what good the abolition of the visa system will do in these negotiations.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, in itself the Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is an excellent piece of work. It focuses on simplification, which is certainly desirable, but, to be frank, it would be naive to consider it a technical agreement. There is a long list of requests to the Israeli authorities from the European Union, from the High Representative, from our consulates in East Jerusalem, and from this Parliament on the settlements in the West Bank, on the continuing annexation of East Jerusalem, on the situation in Gaza and on the resumption of the peace process. If we look at what the EU has obtained with these requests, we see neither real progress nor any serious concessions. I therefore consider this to be anything but a politically neutral measure. My delegation will vote against the ACAA and I am calling on the Commission, should the ACAA be approved, to exercise the highest possible degree of oversight, both in terms of traceability of products to the Occupied Territories, which is a problem that has nothing to do with the good faith of the Commission but rather with Israel, and extension of the agreement to other products without the involvement of the European Parliament.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tone of this debate has changed since June, when we were among the few voices calling for a swift launch to negotiations for a free trade agreement. Japan has always been a very complex case, more difficult to deal with, understand and decipher than many other countries. We now find ourselves under strong pressure from the Member States and many sectors to move as slowly as possible in the direction of a free trade agreement, as if Japan were enemy number one of European industry. I urge the Commission to proceed with a dual approach. On the one hand, it must be firm, since we have included several conditions in our resolution that are entirely advantageous, with great emphasis on non-tariff barriers. However, an effort must also be made to ensure that it is used as far as possible to provide opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, to create the possibility of cultural cooperation with Japan – since as a country it is an ideal candidate with great potential in this area – and to undertake joint scientific research with one of the leading innovators. The second approach should be to make the agreement a success, since it is much more important than so many other agreements in geopolitical terms. It can serve to stabilise relations with South Korea and our economic and trade relations with China. Let us recall that we are dealing with a great democracy, and that this is one of the chief aspects of the agreement. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we support the proposal resulting from the compromise in the Committee on International Trade. We believe a very reasonable balance has been achieved. On one hand, we have a firm date, a deadline. I would ask you all to consider how absurd it would be to reject the committee’s proposal while we have obligations in the World Trade Organisation that we have to fulfil. On the other hand, we are allowing a couple of years more, thereby at least partly meeting the demands of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. I think this debate needs to be kept in proportion. After all, as the Commissioner pointed out in his speech as well, we are talking about an extremely limited volume of trade, although the decision we make tomorrow will be very important to some ACP capitals. There is a kind of asymmetry between the significance that we attach to what is at stake and how certain ACP countries perceive it. I do not believe that setting such a tight deadline – which might almost seem like an imposition, at least in the eyes of some ACP countries – is an effective way of bringing the negotiations on economic partnership agreements to a swifter conclusion. We do want these agreements. However, these partnership agreements need to be concluded in the best possible way, through persuasion and trying to win the other side round. These two extra years, if they are indeed both necessary, could be an opportunity for us to step up our negotiating efforts, not least by expanding the range of people we talk to in addition to just the governments. The general public in these countries remains somewhat wary, so we must also focus on the members of the national parliaments, who often do not ratify agreements but do carry political weight and influence in the debate in their countries and complain that they are not given enough information. As I proposed during our ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Horsens, it may perhaps be necessary to organise public seminars with the media and non-governmental organisations to explain our position properly. There is a Kenyan proverb that says ‘If you want to go far, go together’. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in November 2010, many of us asked the Commission to wait before signing the agreement and present an impact assessment first. The Commission decided to go ahead and sign straight away, assuring us that everything was fine, only to subsequently turn to the Court of Justice and receive a worrying warning from the EU privacy supervisor. Meanwhile, citizens in the EU mobilised in an unprecedented way, with 2.8 million signatures, whilst many entrepreneurs have reacted cautiously with regard to the future of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), precisely because they believe that existing laws can protect them just as effectively. I think that there are two lessons in this, and I hope that the Commission will learn from them with regard to the next measures announced by the Commissioner. The first lesson is that the Web is now considered by European citizens to be a real common good, like biodiversity or water. It is considered a space for individual freedom that must not be threatened by any kind of measure. In Washington, Senator Wyden, Chair of the Subcommittee on International Trade, whom I visited last February, told us that with ACTA, experiences such as Wikipedia
 might have not come into being. I do not know if this statement corresponds to the truth, but we must also adopt the precautionary principle. Secondly, we cannot implement important measures without the citizens’ approval, and there is a need for debate, which so far has been clearly insufficient. I think this should be understood and, if we do not understand it, I believe we will not go very far in today’s Europe. I became familiar with ACTA just after I was elected. I have followed this agreement as shadow rapporteur in a thousand debates in committee, in plenary, – and I have to say the Commission has always shown a very loyal and cooperative attitude – in interviews and in debates with civil society. I do not know if this will be the last debate. I must say that we will certainly be ready for further discussion and, Commissioner, I really do not hope that we will be able to say ‘acta est fabula’
, the play is over. This is in the public interest, in the interest of freedom of expression and, I must say, in the interest of the European institutions’ image as well. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there have been delays in dealing with this agreement in the Committee on International Trade (INTA), but there are many other very different kinds of delays on the ground with regard to improving the condition of the Palestinian population. This is a debate on how to prevent products from the settlements from benefiting from this agreement – this is a red line that cannot be crossed. I appreciate what the Commissioner has said, but it is also true that so far, we have not had any mechanisms that have worked. It is also a debate on the political impact of this agreement, because I believe, indeed I fear, that its adoption would be interpreted as opening a credit line in favour of a government that does not give much credit, so to speak, to questions from the European Union. No tangible progress in the resumption of negotiations, much less on the continued expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem, much less with regard – apart from some modest progress – to the Gaza blockade. For this reason, the treatment of this dossier is more than technical; it is a highly political dossier, not a trivial one, and we call upon the Commission to assess how a trade policy measure can, as is normal in this context, become a foreign policy act on the ground.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it would be a shame if Parliament and the Council failed to give the green light to negotiations with Japan, though this time around asking for something we have never previously asked for in similar situations. I agree with the rapporteur Metin Kazak: if there are no negotiations, Japan will look further east – as Mr Susta said just now – to the rest of Asia and to the Pacific rather than to Europe. Such a closure would be paradoxical for us, given that it is a fully democratic country, whereas we have ongoing negotiations with other countries that are dictatorships in one way or another, such as Vietnam or Singapore. Moreover, let there be no talk about the European crisis as a reason for holding back such negotiations. The crisis will not be defeated by clamping shut like a clam, through protectionism. The crisis will be defeated by open, intelligent trade, by a wisdom that we have perhaps not always had, and by basing our stance on reciprocity, as I – together with Mr Daul, Mr Guerrero Salom, Mr Susta and Ms Muscardini – called for in written statement No 0016/2012 on fair trade, which I invite you all to sign. In this case, it means not closing the door on Japan, but negotiating measures to ensure the removal of non-tariff barriers, bilateral safeguards for sensitive sectors – and we can strengthen such safeguards – the protection of geographical indications for our products, the removal of barriers that hamper trade today, especially for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which could otherwise find a further outlet in Japan, the opening up of Japanese public procurement to our companies, including SMEs, a mechanism for judging business disputes which today we are finding hard to put in place, as well as cooperation on post-Fukushima energy, based on sustainable development. These and other things we can ask for and obtain from Japan. We cannot agree with simply giving up from the start. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats fully supports the new generalised scheme of tariff preferences (GSP), which rationalises the mechanism and makes it more consistent with its constituent objectives of support for countries in the developing world. Congratulations to the rapporteur, Christofer Fjellner, who managed to strike a balance between the various options. There are now two commitments to undertake immediately. We need to coordinate the application of GSP with that of bilateral free trade agreements, first and foremost, so as not to alter the preferential nature of GSP for developing countries, which could even find themselves penalised by less favourable access conditions than those granted to the beneficiaries of bilateral agreements. Even more important is the monitoring of its entry into force, especially of effective compliance with international conventions on human rights, trade union rights, environmental protection and the rule of law. In this area, we have important news: the burden of proof is reversed, meaning it will be up to countries that are potentially non-compliant with these conventions to demonstrate that they are using the criteria of good governance and respect for human rights, by virtue of which they may enjoy this generalised system of preferences. The fact that information on this matter may come not only from the international organisations themselves, promoters of these conventions, but also from Parliament, the Council and especially from civil society, transforms this scheme into a much more participatory and democratic one. There are no less than 27 conventions to observe, including the United Nations one on climate change. This part of the scheme, without which this good work would, for the most part, be in vain, now needs to be fully implemented. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, in our view there are two basic elements here. The first is the issue of democracy, which means full involvement of the European Parliament in decisions on macro-financial assistance (MFA), its implementation and its suspension. Given that these are not technical or executive decisions, it is important that Parliament always be called upon to give its opinion. The second is political conditionality. As has already been pointed out, there is no point in setting up a European External Action Service if it is not fully involved in decisions as important as macro-financial assistance; there is no point in focusing on human rights and then failing to take them into account when making important decisions. I will add a third issue, which I regard as important: Central Asia is not mentioned explicitly among the beneficiaries of MFA, even though they are countries with which we have important economic relations. The European Union has its own specific strategy on Central Asia and it is vital that macro-financial assistance be one of its pillars. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, South Sudan no longer represents the good news we were still hoping for just one year ago. The peoples of South Sudan and of Sudan are enjoying neither peace, stability nor, least of all, development. ‘Walk on your own two legs, walk for a long time, find water and share it’, goes an old saying from the region, but this certainly does not reflect reality. Today, at the most, people walk for a long time but, if they have not stepped on a mine first, water is not easy to find until the rainy season. In fact, it is not easy to help Juba, just as it is not easy to put pressure on Khartoum. However, I believe that action by the Commission, the European External Action Service and the European Union ought to be based on certain fundamental principles. Above all, we must keep attention focused on this crisis, so that it does not risk becoming a forgotten crisis, one of those points on the agenda that is shelved and deprived of the attention of the media and the international community. Secondly, we must insist on full application of Security Council Resolution 2046, which is a key element. Thirdly, we must not be unprepared for what may happen in Khartoum, keeping in mind the fact that Sadiq al-Mahdi, former Sudanese prime minister, evoked the prospect of an Arab Spring in Sudan, in view of the failures both of the administration and of President al-Bashir himself. Let us therefore remain vigilant, to avoid a recurrence of what happened in North Africa. Fourthly, as we are the main donor to South Sudan, we should have more say in the application of laws in Juba. Currently, uniformed soldiers in South Sudan are appropriating land in an arbitrary fashion. The Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement must re-establish its credibility as far as citizens are concerned, which will be quite difficult without a minimum legal system that is effective and independent. This ought to be the European Union’s first priority. Without delay, I will finish with a final point, to which we have already drawn attention: the creation for South Sudan of a transparent fund to collect the proceeds of oil resources, as happened in Timor. Objections may be made that Timor was good news: well, we would like South Sudan to be good news too. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, Ms de Sarnez, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome this report by the vice-chair of the Liberal and Democratic group, a group that believes, perhaps more than others, in trade as a means of spreading well-being and stability worldwide. This is, nevertheless, a report that cuts to the heart of several matters, provocatively at times and without mincing words right from the introduction. There, it clearly states that, on the one hand, China is getting the most from its membership of the World Trade Organisation while, on the other, its economy is not fully recognised as a market economy. It is a slightly anomalous economy, run by the Communist party, with tariff and non-tariff barriers, discrimination in many sectors, subsidies, obstacles of various kinds, bars to participation in public tenders, export credits and much more besides. What is to be done, then, about China, given that it is a country with which we now have considerable economic and trade interpenetration? The first answer from this report is reciprocity, a principle that is seldom practised nowadays and is not easy to enact, but which is the key to this relationship. At the end of the day, is it really that difficult to make it happen? In recent weeks, with several colleagues – Mr Daul, Chair of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats); Mr Guerrero Salom, Vice-chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament; Mr Susta; and Ms Muscardini – we have been working on written statement No 16, with the aim of basing our trade policy on some key concepts: reciprocity, the agreement of environmental and social parameters, transparency, consumer protection, World Trade Organisation rules, and human rights. Tibet has already been mentioned. These are not slogans but values, which – as this report states – if put into practice in our trade relations, represent the best approach not only for sustainable trade, but also for a less extreme and happier China.

 Mr Martin, I believe that China’s membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is a good thing; it would be a mistake to have China outside the WTO, because matters would become much more complicated. Besides, the battles fought by the Commission, among others, within the WTO through various disputes – such as that on raw materials – have been very effective and satisfying. Furthermore, the WTO can certainly also be relied upon as regards various anti-dumping procedures. That does not mean, however, that we can lower our guard when it comes to granting China market economy status, on the one hand, or, on the other, that we should not exploit our own provisions, such as reciprocity, to demonstrate a firmer stance. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologise to the Commissioner – my dear friend. So, now is the time to give some practical responses to the Arab Spring. Europe has followed what has been happening on the opposite shore of the Mediterranean with enthusiasm. We have followed with enthusiasm, concern and a certain element of surprise what had happened and was happening during those months, and what is still happening with the difficult situations in Egypt, Libya especially, and of course Syria. Sometimes I – hesitantly – remember some of the statements by European foreign ministers who, not much more than a year ago, literally – and I remember this because it shows how far we have come – defined Gaddafi as an example of reformism for the rest of Africa, a statement made last February, and Syria as a country – and again I quote – capable of meeting its citizens’ need for modernity from its leadership. This is where we have come from. Another statement from February last year. In the end, however, with the support and empathy of Europe, the Arab Spring eventually emerged with difficulty, and it was a marvellous change. What has happened in the southern Mediterranean has been extraordinary, and is also a reason for great hope, but naturally there are a lot of difficulties ahead. What help can we give as Europeans? What can we do in practical terms to try and make these people taking steps towards democracy understand that economic development also offers prospects for a better life? We have two problems, among others. The first is that the potential for trade between the European Union and southern Mediterranean countries is definitely under-utilised. We are doing less than we could be doing. The report contains some figures, I will not quote them here, but given the geographical proximity and the fact that we all belong to a single area, Mediterranean Europe, the commercial policy figures are certainly rather unsatisfactory. The second problem is that traditionally we – especially the southern Mediterranean countries – have structured our trade relations in such a way that trade with Europe mainly benefited an elite, an oligarchy which often managed the flows from this trade in an extremely exclusive, if not selfish manner. The Arab Spring is trying to liberate political processes, and subsequently we also need to liberate the economy, in order to ensure that those who want to become producers and players in a global economic and commercial process in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Libya and the other countries really can do so, and can have a direct dialogue with Europe. This also means trying, also through a commercial policy, to provide practical help in a social situation that is sometimes desperate. In Egypt, revenues have fallen over 35% compared with during the Mubarak era. There is little investment, tourism is a resource that has almost run dry, and therefore we need new political tools, and here I think that in our work, we have proposed a series of practical elements to meet these expectations, and we will return to these in the final summary. Meanwhile, I would like to thank the Commission heartily for the constant support it has given me as well as the shadow rapporteurs. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to invite the Commission not to be too cautious, on the other hand, and, above all, I would like to invite the House not to be too fixated on the agricultural issue. We cannot carry on considering trade relations between the European Union and Mediterranean countries solely from the point of view of agriculture and, in fact, the report takes a totally different line. We asked for more connection with civil society, more study grants – and I would like to thank the Commissioner for what he said at the beginning on the development of the Erasmus Mundus
 programme – I believe – it is not an issue which concerns the DG Trade – but I believe that it would be useful also to have an Erasmus Med
, something specifically for the Mediterranean countries, as a written declaration from Parliament had, in fact, requested. We are calling for bilateral chambers of commerce between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries which do not yet exist. We are calling for new credit instruments, something – also through the work we have done with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) – is starting to happen, also for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and we are especially calling for liberalisation of this trade through the possibility of allowing new players and entities, like SMEs in fact, to emerge in southern Mediterranean countries. There is an extraordinary amount of talent in this area in the Arab countries that has always been suppressed by the oligarchies in power. In this sense, technical cooperation to dismantle non-tariff barriers – all elements of our report – is crucial. Let us not miss this opportunity. We have the opportunity to use commercial policy, the exclusive competence of the European Union, to do a truly political job, part of which has still not been done, in order to support these processes. There are those who say that nothing has happened, that there have been no Arab Springs. I challenge anyone in this House eighteen months ago to imagine that Mubarak, Ben Ali and Gaddafi would have fallen from power in their countries in the space of a just a few months. Something has happened, and the development and outcome depend also on us, and also on commercial policy instruments, and I must just briefly say a word about the contribution of our Green friends who have just left us: do not have an ideological approach. It is not true that commerce is not good for development, quite the opposite. The report demonstrates all the rest. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, after so much good news from Africa, what a lot of nasty surprises in Mali, a country which has even practised democracy successfully in recent years: we have had hostage taking, threats of secession from the North, the coup d'état
, fundamentalist gangs applying Sharia law, and the risk of famine; five problems, each of which is a human tragedy that is hard to resolve and, apart from anything else, these five problems are capable of contaminating the entire region. Mali is a collateral victim, partly of the conflict that took place in Libya, and finds itself caught up in an issue that is bigger than itself, bigger than the Malian political class. The real reasons have their origins outside its borders as well as in issues related to the conflict in Libya and, as has been said, even further afield. When, in our resolution, we call for a post-Gaddafi strategy for the entire region, we want political and security cooperation to be much more thorough, to go beyond contacts, and, in conjunction with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union and the United Nations in their respective roles, both food security and political security can be guaranteed, knowing that the later you intervene, the harder it is to find a solution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the many misadventures of Nigeria include the deaths of Franco Lamolinara and Chris McManus, two European citizens who were killed during the failed attempt to free them. This was a very sad episode not only because of their deaths, but also because of the way the operation was coordinated between the countries involved, and for the apparent absence of any European involvement dear Commissioner. Italy has complained about the lack of information about what was about to happen – and this is already one issue – but I must say to the Commissioner that the citizens of Europe need a visible face of our shared foreign policy that is able to face its responsibilities on behalf of Member States, especially where there is little coordination, as was the case in Nigeria. Today, many people are licking their wounds, the Italians who were unable to be part of the liberation plan, the British for a failed operation and Europe for having kept a low profile. We condemn terrorism, which is also a phenomenon totally alien to African culture, and call on Nigeria to do its utmost, but we must also learn what the EU’s responsibilities are, and quickly, if we want to be taken seriously by Europe’s citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the blessed sweetness of its finished product, the cocoa market has been practically cursed from the very start. When Francesco Carletti, a Florentine trader who was the first to circumnavigate the Earth using merchant ships between the late 1500s and early 1600s, brought cocoa to Europe, he denounced a business in which the main financing for investments in this plant was derived from the slave trade. Ever since then, the inhumane nature of the cocoa trade has persisted. If the product comes from Ghana or Côte d’Ivoire – which account for almost 60% of global output – then the use of children is a given, the majority of whom are less than 14 years old and often subject to genuine trafficking, which sees them taken away from their families in nearby countries and shut away in the plantations. Last week, I was in Côte d’Ivoire for an annual meeting of Euro-African liberal democrat members of parliament. There, I met the President of the main non-governmental organisation (NGO) that fights against the exploitation of children in cocoa plantations. The organisation is not without support, since even the wife of President Ouattara has come to its aid, opening the national surveillance committee against child exploitation and labour. That said, we need to move away from depending on volunteers, good examples and harsh words, and instead imbue the markets with a sense of social responsibility that has so far been lacking in the cocoa plantations, with their distinctive non-intensive, non-mechanical culture, and the aggravating factor of the use of pesticides that are harmful to workers. The agreement that has been signed – for which I should like to thank Mr Moreira and the Commission – is a step in the right direction, making the chocolate supply chain more transparent, involving NGOs and promoting fairer prices around the world. Since the EU controls most of the votes of importer countries in international cocoa organisations, it has a special responsibility to put the agreement quickly into action and use it as a way to make the production of this popular treat more humane. As significant as it is, however, this agreement alone will not suffice. We also need consumers to be more aware so that they can make ethical purchases, while also promoting the production and sale of fair trade chocolate, which guarantees prices for producers and that no children were exploited in the plantations of Africa during the process. The EU can do much more in this area, including by setting out regulations on (European) certification that has so far been a private initiative. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Menéndez del Valle, who I congratulate, is a very important document as part of the effort we are making, in the Committee on International Trade and in Parliament as a whole, to define new rules and provide a different impetus for trade in the Mediterranean. It is an essential task and one of the great challenges – taking advantage of the exclusive jurisdiction of the European Union on matters of international trade – to provide solutions to those countries that still today have vast untapped potential in terms of trade policy with us. It is not only a matter of bringing about greater stability and prosperity, but also of expanding the social and production base among those who may benefit from the trade policy. In my view, this convention should have three important effects: firstly, promoting South-South trade, now almost at a minimum in the Mediterranean; secondly, promoting market access for small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to operate what I call – as the rapporteur for another measure – ‘Trade for Change’, in other words, trade measures for countries undergoing democratisation in the southern Mediterranean – liberating economic and commercial processes in countries where the few oligarchies in power have centralised the proceeds from trade into their own hands; and finally, making this trade more readily understandable through simple rules. The problem of Israel must also be addressed because otherwise, the credibility of Parliament is at stake. This is an important work: we often wonder why we have only now managed to simplify the 100 plus different regulations governing rules of origin. It is now important for everyone to ratify it as soon as possible. What is happening with regard to the ratification of the mandate of the European Investment Bank for the Mediterranean is not very encouraging, given that Member States are proceeding very slowly. We hope that there will not be the same delay for the convention. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, to be perhaps a little provocative, we could have opened this sitting with a minute’s silence in memory of the more than 600 homeless people who have died this week from the cold. This is the tribute that we generally reserve for great and famous people. That would have represented an assumption of responsibility – perhaps the first by this Parliament – of great symbolic significance. In fact, what we are witnessing is that the instruments of participatory democracy for the defence of rights provided by the Union are incapable of being applied to the homeless, whether or not they are citizens of the European Union, and this is because, I am afraid, there is often no electoral consensus for this. The Vice-President, Mr Barnier, is quite right to remind us that this is a matter within the competence, above all, of the Member States. However, we are dealing here with a phenomenon that is ever more European, cross-border and visible. We therefore ask: what is the timetable for the strategy that we have demanded from the Commission on a number of occasions? How much – aside from the Progress programme – can be allocated from European funds, including the structural and social cohesion funds? We ask in addition: is free movement for the homeless genuinely guaranteed, or is it possible for a Member State to impose restrictions, precisely because these citizens –European citizens – may not have a fixed place of abode at their disposal? Finally, are basic support services guaranteed? Some Member States have refused this to citizens of other Member States, citing European regulations. Are we sure that this is legally admissible? In conclusion, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has established that every European citizen wastes 179 kilograms of food per year. What European strategy should we adopt to combat this waste? I consider that this is an economic and social issue but above all one of the identity of our own European Union. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the most visible aspect of the changes affecting Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (the BRICS), which is also the most significant one in terms of consequences for the life of our societies, regards the economic and commercial penetration of these emerging powers. These changes may lead to stability and widespread prosperity, but appropriate speed is required, both in terms of responses in the international rules – and we know that unfortunately the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations are at a standstill – and in terms of greater integration of our foreign policy with trade policy, taking into account the fact that our foreign policy in some respects is unfortunately still in its infancy, while trade policy, thanks to the exclusive competences of the Treaty of Lisbon, is fully functional. I am wondering, for example, what the role of trade attachés in our embassies is. These trade attachés are not part of the European External Action Service, but will play a key role in the BRICS countries, one that is as important, if not more so, as that of our diplomats.

 Mr President, I am honoured to have been the promoter of this plenary debate. I believe that European prisons suffer from at least two problems. The first is that it is quite difficult to have the instruments of European democracy enter these institutions. In prisons, there are human rights abuses and people’s dignity is mortified, as concerns both detainees and those who work in the prisons, such as the warders. Prisons are overcrowded, a sign of lack of investment: people are crowded in together and the door is shut. There is little knowledge of prison regulations, while copies of them should be distributed and clearly understood by all. There is abdication of the principal role of re-education that prisons should play, not least because employment for detainees is no longer facilitated inside prisons. There is little transparency and hardly any opening to citizens, schools and non-governmental organisations. Budget cuts threaten essential services and the training of personnel and there is an overall lack of interest by the media and politicians. I now go on to the second point. Personally, as part of the initiative that Marco Pannella launched in Italy, for the past three years, I have visited two prisons on 15 August – the day that is most symbolic of holidays – and I have been struck by the absence of the European dimension within them. There are no exchanges of good practices, and few are the moments of contact between the staff and operators from the various European countries. I therefore applaud the publication of this Green Paper, which may cast light on a series of issues: how to improve mutual trust and, naturally, detention conditions; how to associate detention conditions with European regulations on preventive detention, the European arrest warrant, the conditions of minors, the power to inspect, the right to visits by families and all the activities of cultural mediators, which are necessary. The Council is present today and many answers depend on it. We are dealing with a test of civilisation, that is, of European identity. Prisons will always be prisons. I do not believe that the solution lies in emptying them, but they must cease to be those dark corners of rights and European responsibilities. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, I shall begin with a poem by an Uzbek poet, Jogdor Obid (I translate from the English): ‘Little hands, little slaves dream of warm and sunny days, but suffer from coughs and tremble as they walk. Little hands and little slaves, children’s thoughts, dreams of tenderness, but it all ends up dead and buried’. This is the testimony of Jogdor Obid, describing cotton-picking by children in Uzbekistan. This took place in the period of the Soviet Union. Some things have changed, others have not. For example, the power structure has not changed: the Uzbek President today is the same one who, in 1991, was at the head of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Uzbekistan. Other things have changed: the situation of children in the cotton fields is worse, much worse. In other interviews, Jogdor Obid speaks of seven-year-olds who are slaves, being bought and sold in Uzbekistan to harvest cotton. This is an intolerable situation: our demands are the same as those already mentioned: access for International Labour Organisation (ILO) inspectors; for Uzbekistan to act in accordance with the values of human rights, which are, in fact, included in the country’s constitution; for the Commission to propose a traceability mechanism for the cotton harvested, free from the trade in children and their condition as slaves; again for the Commission, also on the basis of the ILO findings, possibly to decide the suspension of the Generalised System of Privileges (GSP) for Uzbekistan. We have done this with the Sri Lanka GSP+, and we could think of doing the same with Uzbekistan. Naturally, there will be no agreement on this protocol by the European Parliament, which can rely on its new Lisbon powers; at stake are the ever-stricter values of the European Union, not least as concerns our international trade policy.

 Mr President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, just yesterday the Italian statistics office reported that the figure for tax evasion in Italy in 2008 was between 16% and 17% of GDP, which comes to between EUR 255 billion and EUR 275 billion. With such figures there will never be any control of the deficit. In its annual report the Italian Court of Audit spoke of the cost of corruption for 2009 at EUR 60 billion, adding that we will never have any kind of growth. The income gap is widening, and we therefore have no social cohesion. I believe it is imperative for the EU to update its convergence criteria, also adding parameters relating to good governance and social equality. I should say that the verification carried out by the Commission on the tax shield of the last Italian government, that from our point of view violated a large part of the European standards on money laundering, competition and tax evasion – as well as on VAT evasion which, following our appeal, was proven to be correct – demonstrates lack of attention on the part of these institutions regarding an approach that should be fair and global.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s call to tighten up its budget brings a moment of truth for countries who have squandered and badly managed their own resources. However, it should also be a moment of truth for Europe with regard to growing social exclusion, and the need to denounce and resolve it. It is enough to read the Caritas reports and speak to volunteers committed to tackling urban poverty to understand the extent of the phenomenon which now affects even those who never thought they would find themselves in a soup kitchen or a hostel. It is enough to look around. A few weeks ago in Paris, in Place de la Bastille, I saw a homeless couple sleeping rough, with a new-born baby between them. There were others in Rue St-Antoine – so we are talking about a wealthy part of Paris – another couple on the ground, on cardboard boxes, with two children under the covers as well. I stopped to look at the reactions of passers-by and, over the course of 15 minutes, no one even stopped to look. The indifference of a large portion of our citizens is another face of this emergency. Last year, I spent a night in Rome with Emmaus volunteers. I learnt a lot, but I also discovered that they were scandalously alone. With this report, which the Italy of Values will support, we ask that a problem which we often prefer to ignore is not forgotten. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank the rapporteur, Mr Kósa, who has been as tireless as ever. This report begins by citing 40 or so official reference documents, including United Nations conventions, communications from the European Parliament and the Commission, resolutions, green papers and miscellaneous acts, which makes one realise just how much work has been carried out over the years on legislation, regulations, guidelines and recommendations in the field of disability. Moreover, this report puts forward a long list of objectives to further the inclusion of our fellow citizens with disabilities. I would like to mention two of these objectives in particular. The first is the participation of people with disabilities in the decision-making process, based on the principle of ‘nothing about us without us’. The second objective is to regard this subject as a human and civil rights issue, in other words, not an issue about a single group of people, but one that touches on the very identity of the European Union. The reality in Europe is very different, however, Mr President, because sadly, we are witnessing an increase in the suffering and pain of people with disabilities in our countries. We see structural funds that should be available but are shamefully left unused by Member States or local authorities, and we see infringements by these same Member States or local authorities that are not punished as they should be by the Commission. We see good practice in some countries, but unfortunately, it is ignored and not exported or valued elsewhere, and we see treatment that varies from one country to another or from one region to another within the same country, which limits considerably the freedom of movement of our fellow citizens with disabilities.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we could hear a small businessman or woman speak in this Chamber today, we would hear a story that is even more worrying than the details we have been given, especially because of the four structural problems facing this sector, which is a crucial sector and an integral part of Europe’s identity. The four problems are help for internationalisation, reducing red tape – we have heard about the hurdles that have to be overcome just to pay VAT in the various countries – innovation and access to the Structural Funds, which some Member States are not using as they should, and access to credit. Commissioner, it is unacceptable that Europe should recapitalise the banks without imposing strict conditions to make them facilitate access to credit for such a crucial sector of the European economy as small and medium-sized enterprises, which are now not being rewarded but held to ransom, if not crippled, by the credit institutions.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, we received a delegation of citizens who described themselves as ‘indignant’. Some have come a long way to get to Brussels, even travelling by foot from Iceland. Being indignant is the exact opposite of cynicism, indifference and resignation. It is a non-violent, transparent way of asking for the current European crisis to be tackled, rewarding the European institutions for being assertive and playing a leading role rather than being at the mercy of national governments, but, above all, it is a way of tackling this crisis with tools involving the real participation of the people. The European Union will have to take difficult, even unpopular decisions. Yesterday’s meeting was short but significant, because it showed that we need to exploit this crisis in order to rebel against the tribal fragmentation of Europe, which prevents it from having a shared vision, but, above all, it showed that we need to involve citizens fully in processes from which, to date, they have felt excluded.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support and thank the rapporteur for the outstanding work she has accomplished in committee, sometimes in circumstances that can hardly be described as relaxed. Trade between the European Union and the Palestinian Authority is minimal. We are certainly a long way from achieving the full potential of this relationship, and who knows when we will also be able to implement the sections relating to fishing, considering the dual illegality the Gaza Strip is subject to: the illegality of the blockade by the Israelis and the illegality of the control exercised by Hamas over the Strip. However, we are finally taking full responsibility for our relations, we are making international trade a fully-fledged instrument of foreign policy and above all we recognise the Palestinian Authority as a negotiating partner with full rights. Paradoxically we are doing this while at the same time, at the UN headquarters in New York, we are dragging our feet on the question of recognising its independence. Let us now hope for rapid implementation with good will shown by all sides. This should include ensuring we do not grant the products of the Jewish colonies any kind of special trade privileges, either as products declared as Israeli or as Palestinian products.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree to a large extent with my fellow Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). There is a degree of hypocrisy and also one of hesitation in what the Commissioner told us. In the 2010 communication, a paradox emerged in that the word Taiwan can neither be written nor spoken. Yet, it is a small China; very democratic and extremely vital both from a trade point of view and in terms of technological innovation. There is a very real principle which we must adhere to, especially in our trade undertakings. Taiwan exists and it exists de facto as a Sovereign State; Taiwan is a full member of the World Trade Organisation; we have excellent trade links with Taiwan and it is negotiating or will negotiate free trade agreements with several third countries. Something else is also true, which is that China, the People’s Republic of China, always responds with much irritation to our contact with Taiwan, nevertheless we do get the impression that it would be able to adapt with a certain level of pragmatism to a next step. Therefore we return to the original question, which we have still not had a compelling response to: is a free trade agreement possible with Taiwan, even at a lower or sectoral level? I think that this Parliament would be ready to support the Commission in such an undertaking. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Minister, Mr Nicolai, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that there are three things we can be sure of. The first is our deep friendship with the Palestinian people, a people that is suffering, that suffers every day. One has to visit the occupied territories to see the daily suffering of the Palestinian people, and this is a people to whom the international community owes a debt. The second certainty is the tie that binds us to Israel as Europeans, a tie that is probably stronger than that with any other country outside the EU, because Israel is an indispensable part of Europe’s cultural and moral identity; it is part of our family. The third certainty, unfortunately, is that Europe is always divided or highly conservative in its positions. These limitations are clear also in this vote at the United Nations, which will probably be another mortifying occasion after the absence of any European policy to speak of in the Libyan crisis, and yet it is only up to us, Minister, Commissioner. European citizens are finally asking for a qualitative leap, a position from Europe as a whole and, if possible, I hope there will be a position in support of the declaration of independence, as many Israelis too are asking, contrary to their government, and as Palestinians are asking from a basic sense of justice. Support for independence would first of all be in line with the reality of the Palestine that there is, that exists despite everything, and that no one can cancel from the maps. Its identity paradoxically grows stronger in the national sentiment with every day that passes, thanks to the occupation. In second place the security and the very identity of Israel would be strengthened. This security and identity are guaranteed more by the existence of two separate States with clear borders than by the prospect – and this is something we should ask the Israeli leaders in 20 years’ time – of a single State shared by Palestinians and Israelis. Finally, this declaration of independence would be a break with the stagnant waters of European diplomacy and the negotiations that are going nowhere. If we fail to embrace this break then we are condemning ourselves, after the financial crisis, to remaining on the sidelines also of international diplomacy. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I recall meeting an Italian entrepreneur a few years ago in Uzbekistan. He was trying – successfully – to tie up some contracts to sell the shoes that he made in what was not much more than a workshop, without knowing Russian or much less Uzbek, yet he managed it. This is a slightly unusual example because, in the end, while the European Union is a major international economy, on the one hand, on the other, 90% of our revenue is created by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), of which only 15% export to outside the European Union and only 30% trade outside their own country. Essentially, we are faced with a contradiction that reveals a profound vulnerability. The very concept of an SME necessarily implies the ability to be reactive and flexible – as shown by this Italian entrepreneur in Uzbekistan – and these skills also apply to internationalisation. However, this potential is largely wasted. We do not use the opportunities presented by the markets, by consumer goods and by the new lightweight technologies that we could use in public tenders – though in that situation with a certain wariness, because I think the public procurement sector is still the most difficult for SMEs hoping to internationalise. Unfortunately, the tools available to SMEs are obviously not suited to their needs, which is the very reason behind this debate. There are too many instruments and too much bureaucracy involved in using them, as well as a lack of multilingual skills available to SMEs – which is a significant obstacle – and insufficient training and information. That is why we are asking the Commission for a thorough revision of the measures to assist in the internationalisation of SMEs, as well as for a precise target. Let us set ourselves an objective along the lines of doubling the rate of internationalisation among SMEs in 10 years – something we can use as a yardstick for the new policies. That said, we also call on SMEs, because internationalisation – quite aside from all the objective difficulties and hitherto inadequate instruments – is also a question of culture, mindset, openness and keeping up with the times. The survival of SMEs, millions of jobs and the identity of our Union are at stake. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to return to the previous point, namely Prime Minister Berlusconi’s visit to this institution, because, as we have learnt, it is already the subject of jibes and ridicule. I should just like to know, Mr President – in the light of your explanation that there has been no official request for a meeting and that there will be no official visit by the Italian Prime Minister to the European Parliament – whether you will be meeting him and what the status of that meeting would be, tomorrow, during a visit which, I can assure you, most members of the public in our country regard as something of a mockery, given that the Prime Minister was due to appear in court in Naples tomorrow.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is in favour of this request; many things have happened in the Mediterranean this year, and I think that the events in Libya over the last few weeks deserve our attention. We cannot postpone the vote until such time as Colonel Gaddafi is captured, if he is captured – because this could happen soon, or it could take a long time. It is clear that the Libyan situation is an ongoing crisis. Europe has not always spoken with one voice in recent months on Libya; at times it has even been weak, and I believe that, with a vote, with an official pronouncement from Parliament, we can make a decisive contribution.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a debate that fails to inspire much of a reaction among people. The issue of the Doha negotiations is far removed from most citizens, the media, and even many governments, which are now busy dealing with far more pressing financial and economic priorities. This is not a debate that truly excites Brussels, nor even, it seems to me, Geneva, at least not from what I have seen this year, both in the WTO Parliamentary Assembly and in its steering committee, of which I am a member. There is an air of resignation about the fact that nothing is happening now, that nothing must happen, that nothing can happen, that the challenges facing a better-regulated and more generous global market are too complicated, and that the boundaries between the opposing blocs – between emerging countries that regard themselves today as powers and the former powers of old, which are now struggling, countries in constant transition, with an identity crisis – are themselves always shifting and vague. In other words, the ship that the World Trade Organisation – and, therefore, we too – are aboard does not know where it is heading, because, as Seneca wrote, ‘If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favourable.’ In the meantime, Commissioner, the poorest countries are losing out: they were encouraged to comply with international trade rules, and a good 32 out of 48 of them have joined the WTO, but what good has it done them so far? Theirs is a paradoxical situation: they account for less than 1% of international trade, but have 12% of the world’s population, people who are often forced to live without access to basic services. The forthcoming Eighth WTO Ministerial Conference has a duty to adopt at least – I repeat, at least – a package of measures to help them, and yet we have received no guarantees on that score – anything but. We call on you, Commissioner, to look into this matter. Although it would have no significant impact on international trade balances, the poorest countries would benefit greatly from measures such as the introduction of duty-free access quotas for their products, the simplification of rules of origin, the introduction of measures to correct market distortions in sectors such as the cotton sector, the provision of technical assistance to internationalise their economies and – an extremely important requirement for us members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – the extension of the TRIPS waiver beyond 2016 for pharmaceutical products and data protection. As far as we understand, none of this has been agreed yet. I understand your disappointment, Commissioner – we are disappointed too. We support you and the Commission in your commendable efforts. If there is no prospect of meeting the needs of the poorest countries, then we can well imagine the situation regarding much more complex issues, such as the balance between emerging countries, the European Union and the United States. If I am not mistaken, Pascal Lamy today inaugurated work on the construction of the WTO’s new headquarters in Geneva: this is a first step, and I must say that the need for proactive and industrious efforts to revive the work programme, objectives and the identity of international trade itself has never been so great.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this modification of the Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament we have an opportunity to uphold two principles, namely the transnational list, so that we have something more than an embryo at last, and a genuine step in the direction of European federalism, and we in the Italia dei valori 
party welcome the rapporteur’s tenacity in this regard. However, it is a mistake to think that the transnational list alone will reawaken the interest of the citizens, half of whom already fail to vote in European elections. We need innovative quality indicators that are in touch with society. We in the Italia dei valori
 party have proposed in committee to set a ceiling on MEPs’ mandates, in order to change those in office and create a process of renewal. This amendment was rejected – on rather ridiculous grounds, in my view – by MEPs instinctively seeking to protect themselves and their position. We are committed to making other changes for the next part-session: the first change concerns the regional dimension of elected representatives and constitutions – of MEPs – to ensure that they have a strong relationship with their home region, and the second change will be made both through the amendment tabled jointly with the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament – and I am grateful to Mr Gualtieri – and with a separate text aimed at ensuring a ‘clean Parliament’, as requested by the public. A ‘clean Parliament’ that prevents people who have received definitive sentences – and thus obtained all the guarantees of a fair trial – for extremely serious offences such as terrorism, corruption, organised crime, incitement to racial hatred, and so on from standing in elections. It is a disgrace that those guilty of such crimes should be able to sit in this House today. More courage is needed, ladies and gentlemen, and it is only with pioneering European rules that the European Parliament will obtain all the credibility it deserves. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the impression is that we are having difficulty bringing together all the possible instruments and making even small but tangible gestures. We have: political dialogue, trade policy, development coordination, immigration policies and humanitarian aid with separate managers, procedures and budget lines and sometimes Europe picks a card and uses the policy it likes the most, but we need to pursue every option to help whoever is most deserving and to update all the instruments. For example, trade with Egypt and Tunisia cannot continue with the same agreements for other countries in the region. A Mediterranean development bank is needed or, alternatively, the mandate of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could be extended, just as the European Investment Bank can finance small enterprises in Moldova or in Ukraine, but not in Egypt. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe reach the Caucasus and Central Asia, but there is no Mediterranean integration cooperation organisation. What initiatives do we intend to adopt in this direction? Is Parliament currently asking for a specific Erasmus programme for the Mediterranean and why is the Commission not rolling out this initiative immediately? An Arab employee of a multinational can obtain a visa for Europe, but a small Tunisian entrepreneur who wants to sign a contract cannot. High Representative, it is up to you not to waste any initiative and to consistently bring together all our actions from the many European Union bodies, otherwise, the change will take over and inspire the Mediterranean, but it will not have inspired us.

 Madam President, in addition to the opening of a delegation in Ulaanbaatar – something that we can no longer put off, not least because pursuing relations from Beijing is very bad for symbolic reasons – and in addition to the long-awaited partnership agreement, we are all aware both of the country’s mineral wealth and of its weaknesses in terms of social justice, even though Mongolia has, in its own way, developed a form of democratic cohesion. I would especially like to ask the Commission where Mongolia should be placed from a geostrategic point of view: it is not a country covered by the Central Asia strategy. I think, however, that some of the measures in this strategy could perhaps be extended to Mongolia, in view of its cultural history, which is similar to that of the other countries. The country also currently has observer status in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the European Union is examining the possibility of helping it become a full member, given the ancient cultural links that exist between Europe and Mongolia.

Madam President, it is difficult to oversee the final steps in the formation of a new country along a peaceful path. The ultimate objective – peace – must be safeguarded, but without losing significant pieces of the global agreement. Khartoum’s military action in Abyei appears to be jeopardising the good overall outcome of this journey, though not the founding of the 54th African state on 9 July. The South must not react to provocation and not lose sight of the final objective, which is not only independence but also the constitution of credible institutions and the advancement of its population, 90% of which lives below the poverty line. The people are unlikely to benefit from foreign investment, which already promises to be transparent and not predatory. I believe that this – the problem of foreign investment in South Sudan – will soon be a new front line that the European Union must monitor and on which it must assert the credibility it has earned in recent years in this region.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is something wrong about holding a debate in May 2011 on a natural disaster that occurred in summer 2010, a disaster that left 12 million people homeless and destroyed 20% of the country concerned. I do not support the socialist position, which was expressed by Mr Susta just now. It is partly due to this hesitation that we are still racking our brains trying to work out which instruments we can adopt in order to actively help Pakistan, and on top of our frustration at not having achieved that yet, we are also conscious that we need a trade policy approach that is more mature in political and humanitarian terms: trade policy must become one of the instruments for helping populations in difficulty. I admit that the Commission has acted swiftly and effectively by proposing a package of measures, which obviously needed to be discussed and rebalanced so that they did not penalise a European sector that has already been tested by the crisis. It is thanks to the work done by the Committee on International Trade, including that contained in certain amendments – among which the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports Amendment 37 – that businesses, too, can request application of the safeguard clause. However, it seems that these are bad times for Pakistan and that too many people are failing to face up to their responsibilities. We are asking India to change its attitude and to soften its ‘no’ stance at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as a tangible sign of good-neighbourly relations. True, relations are difficult between those two countries, since there was also the Mumbai attack and Pakistan’s poor cooperation in identifying and capturing the perpetrators of the attack. Yet that affair could be something that breaks the bad habits of a bad relationship between neighbours. We are also asking the Pakistani authorities for something, namely, to be more determined to consider this issue from a bilateral point of view in their relations with India. Bilateral meetings have recently taken place, though little has come of them, perhaps due to a pride issue on the Pakistanis’ part. It is clear that cricket diplomacy, emphasised by Pakistan’s Members of Parliament, whom we met just two weeks ago, has so far failed to produce meaningful results. Lastly, it is the WTO, above all, that we are asking – as we did in Geneva during the recent Interparliamentary Assembly – quickly to adopt mechanisms that will enable international trade rules to respond swiftly and flexibly to emergencies in a country hit by unforeseen disasters. This tariff reduction affair may end up achieving nothing, or it could open a new era in trade relations. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these negotiations are a little like the four-armed God Shiva, since it takes so much effort to conclude such a complex agreement. I am now going to explain the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Firstly: access to medicines. While I welcome the Commissioner’s statement, I confirm that I am against any attempt to implement protectionist measures in a sector in which Europe actually hindered access to low cost medicines in the past. Exploiting the issue of counterfeiting purely for protectionist purposes is about as low as it gets. The agreement should instead be an opportunity for the Indian and European pharmaceutical industries to cooperate with one another. Secondly: industrial sectors. We are asking India to allow sensitive sectors such as the automotive and alcohol sectors, in which our exports are today heavily taxed, to also feature in the agreement. Thirdly: agriculture. For our part, we declare ourselves willing to discuss agricultural products and to open up our market, but with a few conditions attached: obviously, we must say ‘no’ to GMOs and do everything we can to protect geographical indications. As regards this last aspect, I would remind you that geographical indications are not just a trade policy matter; they are also part of Europe’s identity. We therefore hope that a huge effort will be made to simplify registration procedures in India’s bureaucratic system, which is very onerous, perhaps even more onerous than the European one, which says it all. As regards public procurement, I congratulate the Commission if it is true that India seems to be prepared, for the first time, to include public procurement in an international agreement. Indian railways – to give you an example, 17 000 trains transport 18 million passengers every day, and there are plans to build a further 25 000 kilometres of track in the next 10 years – are one of the many markets that could potentially be opened up with this free trade agreement. If the negotiations go well, both parties will benefit: sustainable development will be promoted, child labour will gradually be eradicated and a more progressive form of social protection will be upheld. I feel it is pointless and detrimental to oppose this, and so I call on all the groups in Parliament to reject a priori
 a compromise text. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Schlyter for his excellent report on a sensitive issue on which a great deal of common sense is needed. Not all investment agreements can be replaced by European agreements, but not even the Commission can ignore agreements that infringe European provisions, and we agree with the rapporteur about placing the emphasis on transparency. Ideally, we should have a clause that automatically repeals the 1 200 agreements currently in force. Unfortunately, however, that would mean legal uncertainty for investors and too much work, perhaps, for the Commission. Our amendments in the Committee on International Trade have been successful, firstly, in ensuring that the Commission’s powers are fully respected and, secondly, in stating that legal certainty should be guaranteed. Some of the amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow in plenary may now alter this compromise and balance, and I call on my fellow Members, and the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs in particular, to come up with a balanced measure that is acceptable to all. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for time immemorial, if there is one trade that is difficult to control, it is the arms trade. There are various ways to make this control difficult. One is to trade in apparently harmless weapons or techniques that can easily become a weapon, and that is why we are concerned with dual use in the regulation. Another difficulty is the plethora of rules that make any control system ineffective. When we started working on this case, the Commission asked us to amend a regulation dating from 2000. Meanwhile, this has been revoked and we were called on to amend the more recent 2009 regulation on the basis of the same obsolete proposal. We have just entered trialogue and we already have a new legislative proposal from the Commission, again to amend the regulation. The first request is therefore to establish clear, simple and transparent rules for European exporters having a consolidated text. Four points on the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). With regard to shipments of low value, we in the ALDE concur with the Council in being very sceptical about this system. Parliament has already limited the maximum value from EUR 5 000 to 3 000 and imposed various other criteria. The list of destination countries is very limited. This is something that small and medium-sized businesses legitimately want, but our main message is that we want security above all, as well as trade, and we must go back to work on this in the trialogue. We support the policy of ex ante notification and the obligation of registration by Member States. Finally, we demand the maximum degree of transparency to ensure that the regulation provides a mechanism which informs stakeholders, such as human rights or peace monitoring and trade unions organisations, of the various stages that made up the decision-making process, including through a report to the European Parliament Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Generalised System of Preferences is one of the few methods of differentiation that works in favour of developing countries in international trade. It is a delicate instrument that must be used in the best way. Tonight we are talking about an extension, which means that the Commission date will be postponed once the new final proposal has been submitted. In the meantime, however, we are saying that this is a tool to be handled with caution, and that also applies to inter-institutional relations. Until now, even on the basis of the pre-Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament has not always been fully involved in decisions, as happened at the time of the discussions on Colombia or Sri Lanka that fired the enthusiasm of this House. We must also consider the merits of an ex-post
 evaluation of the decision to implement the regulation. What is the impact of the effects of a tariff reduction, what about its suspension, what are its mechanisms, what is its procedure? Sometimes an on-the-spot examination of these issues may reveal surprises and suggest the most relevant criteria to make the impact of the regulation as effective as possible. As far as the conditions are concerned, the world is changing and the instrument must show greater compliance with regard to those countries rewarded by the tariff concessions. The main concept of respect for human rights must be complemented by a broader vision in which, as noted by the rapporteur Mr Scholz – whom I thank for the excellent work he has done in this report – various indicators are taken into consideration: post-conflict rehabilitation, the specific situation of women, trade unions, the situation of recovery after natural disasters, environmental sustainability and compliance with international social agreements. If we were to adopt a combination of these criteria, I would not be surprised if the list of beneficiary countries we came up with were different from the current list and perhaps more deserving, but we will be able to talk about this again once we have the final proposal for a regulation.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you have already provided some information, Commissioner, but I would like more details. Firstly, the WTO. What exactly are we doing at the WTO concerning the initiative that was already taken in 2009 but which, as far as I know, concerned magnesium and bauxite? Do we have a procedure at the WTO regarding rare earths? Is such a procedure possible and do we initiate it alone, or can we initiate it together with the United States and Japan, as I think would be desirable? Secondly, you have said that we need to increase supplies from other deposits, including European ones. Is there a role for Greenland? What is the precise thinking in this respect? Thirdly, the recovery of rare earths from recycling. Are we moving towards a set of European rules on so-called urban mining? Will there be a directive or a regulation? What is planned in this respect? Fourthly, with regard to studies and investigation, the development of investigations, will we have some specific provisions in the Eighth Framework Programme also? Furthermore, with regard to the stockpiling system, will we have common European rules on stockpiling in this case, too? Finally, to what extent is the issue being dealt with bilaterally with China as part of the high-level economic and commercial dialogue and in the negotiations under way on the new partnership and cooperation agreement with that country? Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, this agreement contains a clause that does not convince us and has never convinced us. I am talking about the refund of customs duties that Korea will receive for imports of products from China or other countries. We have already discussed this, but as a liberal democrat I consider this measure to be deeply flawed. It is a kind of export subsidy, and I would like it if, when voting on this agreement, we had an assurance that this clause will not set a precedent and will not be included in any other future agreements. Tomorrow’s vote will conclude one leg of the journey we have undertaken together, but only one leg, because the relationship between Parliament and the Commission must continue, not least with regard to the actual implementation of the safeguard clause. For the sake of European industry and European workers, we cannot make any mistakes when implementing it, or else we will face great problems in future agreements. This is the Year of the Rabbit in the Far East, so I hope European industry will run like a rabbit, taking advantage of what this agreement can offer it. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start my speech with a statement supposedly made by the Italian Foreign Minister yesterday in Damascus, during which he said – listen to this – that Syria ‘is a stable country in which the population’s desire for modernisation has been satisfied’. Meanwhile, a few days ago, Italy’s Interior Minister made another statement in which he shifted his responsibilities to Europe, which has allegedly abandoned Italy ‘as usual’, he added with a hint of mischief. As usual, however, we are witnessing the habit of blaming Europe when it suits, only to ignore it irritably when Brussels disapproves of the agreement on sea repatriations, which violates humanitarian law and lines the pockets of African dictators – some of whom are today being toppled – and continuing even today to lavish billions on the Libya of Mr Gaddafi, or refusing EUR 10 million of aid offered to the Italian Government by the European Fund for Refugees, which Italy decided not to use, possibly because it would have to be spent in keeping with Europe’s transparent rules and not the in-house criteria of the Italian Civil Protection Agency. Therefore, I think that we will achieve nothing by acting like this and by making these declarations. The lesson of recent weeks has really not been learnt. Lampedusa reminds us that history is stronger than certain political games and recourse to declarations that create illusions. It reminds us that not everything can be bought with money, that Europe is not something that can be called upon when it suits, but is a project that must be committed to each day, demanding rights and solidarity but also respecting the commitments undertaken. In order to slow down migration in a sustainable and purposeful way, five things are needed: democracy, development, respect for international law, European solidarity and also, above all, no prejudicial rhetoric.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am a liberal democrat both in Europe and in Italy. Sometimes, however, in my country, my fellow party members and I are called communists merely for opposing the current government. It seems that the same thing is now happening to our colleagues in Bulgaria, with liberal democrats and socialists being called criminals simply because they represent an opposition force in their country. We disapprove of this move, because if it is a joke, then it really should only be a short one. Behaviour of this kind can become really dangerous in the end. In addition, after everything that has happened in Egypt and Tunisia, only yesterday, the Italian Foreign Minister visited Damascus in Syria and called it ‘a democratic country that completely satisfies its citizens’ need for modernisation’. If our representatives make speeches like this, it is our duty as Members of the European Parliament to denounce them and the Commission must keep a close watch. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I began working at the European Parliament as a political adviser in 1991 and at that time the conflict between northern and southern Sudan was already a recurring crisis. Finally, after 20 years, it seems we are seeing a bit of light at the end of a long, arduous tunnel. As Mr Milana and others have pointed out, much still needs to be done, but many of us were preparing for the worst and expecting the civil war to start up again. I therefore congratulate the north and south of the country on this initial referendum result. Every day counts now until the declaration of independence. No-one can allow themselves to put a foot wrong, either in Khartoum, in Juba, in Brussels or at the African Union in Addis Ababa. For example, the idea of opening an EU delegation with special status until the declaration of independence is definitely to be welcomed. Sudan is about to teach us,the international community, a wonderful lesson about cynicism and about crises that, more out of a sense of resignation than anything else, we often consider to be unsolvable.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the fate of Eastern Christians is changing the map of cultures, with communities thousands of years old – ‘Copt’ means ‘Egyptian’ in Greek – now looking to emigrate overseas to escape from the violence they have been suffering. However, the media or xenophobic parties should not make the mistake of calling this a clash of religions or a clash of civilisations. I would like to recount a short incident that I find significant. Years ago in Cairo, an old man from the countryside who delivered milk to our house three times a week stood at our door crying. We could not understand what he wanted, as all he could say through his tears was ‘Said Akbar
, Said Akbar
,’ the great old man, the great old man. We eventually realised that he was showing his Christian customers his grief at the death of Karol Wojtyła, who had just passed away. This was a simple, sincere man, a Muslim who acted with all the ancient mutual respect of the Mediterranean peoples. This short but significant incident, reflecting widespread values in Egyptian society, happened in the same country in which the Copts were massacred at Christmas. Today, however, Eastern Christian communities need protection. They are sometimes trapped in the settling of scores between terrorists and fundamentalists and authoritarian powers. European foreign policy should not remain powerless while the world changes. It should not be afraid to say the word ... (The President cut off the speaker) Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it really is true that Haiti is a case apart, that it is different, because anniversaries of disasters are always commemorated in order to remember the victims, to learn from one’s mistakes and do better next time, but it is different in Haiti because there is nothing to remember – nothing has happened yet. Instead of saying one year after
 the earthquake, we should actually be saying one year of
 earthquakes, because there was the seismic earthquake, then the earthquake with regard to the shambolic aid distribution, then the health earthquake with the cholera outbreak, then the political earthquake with the non-transparent elections that were held at probably the worst possible time, and now the earthquake that is, in some respects, historical too, with the return of the former dictator in the guise of a dubious multi-millionaire tourist. The Commission is doing good work – very good work, in fact. I visited Haiti last June with the Committee on Development and I saw the excellent work being done, for which we thank the Commission. However, there needs to be greater political protection and an enhanced role for the international community, which must set targets and deadlines and must directly oversee part of the reconstruction. This must be balanced with the increased involvement of the population and local NGOs, which are often frozen out instead. A lesser role for the national politicians and national government institutions of Haiti, then, and a greater role for the so far fragile partnership between its citizens and the international community.

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Côte d'Ivoire is a test case and a test case we cannot afford to fail. This applies to the European Union above all because there is no way we can acknowledge a stolen victory but neither is there any way we can stop exerting maximum pressure on the Ivorian leaders over this massive fraud. Furthermore, it will not be acceptable for a single euro from European taxpayers to end up in or even pass through an illegal government that disregards even the most elementary rules of democracy. Côte d'Ivoire must be made aware of this. Côte d'Ivoire is now also a test case for the African Union, which is dealing with the situation in a very interesting way, so far showing a degree of firmness and unity that would have been unthinkable only 10 or 15 years ago. This is a sign that the Ivorian affair should not be exploited to revive old stereotypes of black Africa being incompatible with democracy. Even though we hover on the brink of widespread violence, which would be catastrophic, Ivorian society is so far also passing this difficult test: it gave a majority to the reformist candidate Mr Outtara and appears to have learned the lesson of the great Ivorian writer Ahmadou Kourouma, who in 1998 published a book with the apt title ‘En attendant les votes des bêtes sauvages
’ (Waiting for the Wild Beasts to Vote), which tells this very story from a democratic and very Ivorian standpoint Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are only a few of us here this evening to talk about anti-dumping, which is, however, an issue we speak about a great deal in our own countries. I believe that there is no issue in international trade that business people, small and medium-sized enterprises, trade unions and consumers care more about than dumping. Dealing with dumping is basically a daily task for a large part of our productive economy. The Commission is working hard and is certainly doing its duty when it comes to anti-dumping initiatives, but we are calling for action based on the following principles. Firstly, transparency of action, full transparency of procedures, of the evaluation criteria adopted and their results, and then communications and a communications strategy, because the actions taken on anti-dumping by the European Commission can serve to reassure our business people and workers. Secondly, there is space for the exercise of discretion in anti-dumping procedures. This is common sense, but sometimes I have the impression that too much discretion is exercised in the decisions that are taken. Thirdly, following the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament must be better integrated, involved and informed. It seems to me that there the Commission is labouring somewhat to recognise Parliament’s role in international trade – even though much effort has been made, for which we are grateful to the Commissioner – and Parliament certainly needs to have a stronger voice on anti-dumping as well. Lastly, there is the question of dialogue with society. Once again, perhaps, the Commission still has much to do on this issue. Parliament cannot merely sit and listen to the players in society, including in anti-dumping matters. In this respect, the Commission should probably take note of the new requirements with respect to the exclusive powers on international trade recognised to it by the Treaty of Lisbon. Lastly, it is clear to us that anti-dumping must be part of a coherent commercial strategy and an integrated policy based on the criteria of honesty and openness. Bearing this in mind, Europe will be able to move forward with its head held high. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first the epicentre of a terrible earthquake, in precisely the poorest and worst-governed area in the American hemisphere, and now cholera in the country which receives one of the highest amounts of per capita international aid. What a contradiction! It is not just a terrible combination of bad luck: in Haiti, in the streets crowded with children and tents crammed in amongst the rubbish, no one knows where to begin. The local political class is often greedy and focused on power games rather than taking control of the reconstruction efforts, and the bureaucratic machine, decimated by the earthquake, has a weak administrative culture and, in some cases, has even obstructed the distribution of aid. There are many, often badly run, international organisations and, in fact, they have failed to protect the population. Visiting the country with the European Parliament delegation in June, the concentration of abandoned fields, rubble which had not been removed and rubbish already gave a clear indication of how bad the situation could become. Now cholera is here. The Commission and the Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) have so far done what was required, but they must now redouble their efforts. My feeling is that now, as well as strong recovery action, Haiti needs greater protection at the international political level. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today marks a fork in the road between two crucial principles. On the one hand, there is the duty of solidarity towards a country that has been hit by natural disasters, bringing its society, which already has structural problems, to its knees. On the other hand, there is the necessity for a balanced trade policy. With the European Commission’s proposal to suspend duties for Pakistan, the European Union is rightly avoiding a policy of mere humanitarian aid, allowing Pakistan to strengthen its economy and therefore its society. The fact that all 74 of the tariff lines involved relate to the textile and clothing sector is almost inevitable for a country that can export only products within this sector. We liberal democrats definitely prefer recourse to this kind of measure, rather than agreeing on humanitarian aid which is incapable of giving the country a genuine boost. However, as Mr Melo reiterated a short while ago, we must not be naive and we ask the Commission – above all – not to make the mistake of naivety. The Commissioner is well aware of the critical situation in which some textile districts, such as Prato, find themselves. Prato is a special case: The situation there has gone out of the control of the national authorities and there is widespread illegality, which is also exacerbated by the crisis in the European textiles sector. Since we believe that it cannot be just the European textiles sector that pays for our rightful humanitarian solidarity with Pakistan, we ask for three things to be done: 1) To set up regulatory instruments to avoid all possible triangulation with other countries that could profit from the duties from which Pakistan is benefiting; 2) Not to aggravate the crisis in the European textile sector, by implementing measures that could instead support it, such as a reduction in the cost of electricity; and 3) To avoid creating a precedent for other countries that suffer such natural disasters. By working in this way, I think the aid for Pakistan is shared and sustainable, including in the long term, and that is what that country needs. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Madam President, if you were to visit the Ponte Rialto
 in Venice – perhaps with Commissioner De Gucht – and wanted to buy a pair of shoes advertised as Italian, a tie, a traditional mask or a glass from Murano, there is a chance you will be ripped off, realising that the product purchased was not made in Italy at all, but in some country in Asia. I believe that the proposed regulation under discussion is beginning to inject some order into an ever more confused global market. It seeks to protect the consumer – including you Madam President, and Commissioner De Gucht, if you go shopping on Venice’s Ponte Rialto
, or elsewhere – as well as the European industries that have not relocated (whilst those that have will be penalised by this regulation). Above all it will correct the asymmetry on the trade markets, which sees Europe as the only large area lacking a regulation on compulsory origin marking. This is not a protectionist proposal; in fact, I find it to be very balanced. It only applies to a limited number of products, to the final product destined for the consumer, and – as far as my group is concerned – it is a 5-year pilot project because we shall support the amendment with the sunset clause. In addition, we also introduced in committee – through an amendment of my own – a provision that aims to avoid any excessive bureaucratic burden that would harm businesses. If the vote tomorrow is satisfactory, it will mean that one stage has been won, but it will not be a conclusive victory. We shall then need the full support of the European Commission in our dealings with the European Council. The Commission has already been full of suggestions and very cooperative, for which we are grateful, and this is a reason why we must continue to work together. I am sure that in five years, we shall be satisfied by the result we have obtained. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations have been difficult, with strong opposing opinions as well as different interpretations of the consequences of this agreement. As far I as can make out, the current status of the negotiations provides for an imbalance in the treatment of geographic indications and marks, in favour of the latter, as well as the failure to act, in violation of Article 22 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of International Property Rights, on marks that use denominations protected by geographical indications. ‘Parmesan’ – one of a number of possible examples – can be freely produced as ‘Parmesan’ in the United States and Australia and exported to China or elsewhere in direct competition with European products, one of the strengths of which is geographical indications. Consequently, European products seem to be propping up unfair competition without any effective protection from the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. I should like a clarification in this regard. ‘Parmesan’ means ‘from Parma’, not Australia or the United States, and this applies equally to all European geographic indications. We must be careful because if, in the course of 21st century globalisation, in a few years’ time, we no longer have our geographic indications, it will partly be because of today’s mistaken choices and we shall lose an enormous piece of our identity. In this regard, if all that were permitted by the ACTA, the agreement would be unacceptable. There is also the question of the Internet, as already mentioned. The European Union is in favour of a society of widespread knowledge, open to all, and the ACTA must not in any way constitute a restriction on the freedom of access to the Internet. Much has been gained on this issue. The Commissioner has given his important assurances, but it would be unacceptable if the acquis communautaire
 were tarnished, as still appears to be the case, by the possibility of legal injunctions provided for by Article 2, and by the possibility of criminal sanctions, including for individual users, as provided for by Article 2(14)(1). I appreciate the highly important assurances on access to medicine for developing countries, but we know that the list of countries adhering to the ACTA is very limited and excludes the great powers of counterfeiting, in Asia, in particular, but not only there. So for this reason, given everything we have to lose on geographic indications and risks on the Internet, the impression – for now – is that the agreement represents only a disadvantage and on this basis, perhaps it is better to let it drop.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs De Keyser has already said nearly all there is to say. I would like to dedicate this minute to a baby boy who I met on 1 December 2009 in Luanda, when we were in Angola for the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly. The baby boy was at the end of his life, he was dying due to malnutrition in his mother’s arms in the Divine Providence Hospital in the centre of Luanda, near the place where we were doing our work and near the stadium that was being built for the African Cup; in other words, he was surrounded by plenty. Yet this was not an isolated case: every day in Luanda, children are still dying of hunger, due to malnutrition, in the arms of their young mothers who have not been taught anything about nutrition and who are often left to their own devices. For a Christian, sights like this constitute a sin – a great sin; for a politician, they are a sign of the failure of our policies; and for the ruling class of that country, Angola, they are also a sign of greed and the unfair distribution of wealth. I believe the reasons why that child had such a fleeting existence on the earth give us much food for thought and I hope my testimony will contribute to this reflection. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a summit between China and the European Union is a model affair between two friends who have mutual reasons for satisfaction. In certain respects, they go back a long way, because Europe and China have both contributed to a safer and more prosperous world. Trade policy represents a crucial factor in this combined effort, even if something is not working properly, and even if it is true to say that over the last five years, the European trade deficit has tripled. This is not sustainable for the European Union but perhaps inevitable, due to China’s constant social and environmental dumping, its world record for counterfeit medicines, its market that is closed to services, its unwillingness to take part in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and its instinctive reaction to conduct a closed policy, even with regard to human rights: from the oppression of Tibet, which is culturally, spiritually and ethnically stifled, to this obstinate refusal to recognise the de facto sovereignty of Taiwan, the repression of freedom of expression in the media and on the Internet and the shameful systematic use of the death penalty. All this is old politics to us – and we are bound to say this to our Chinese friends – because why should we offend the intelligence of a people whose civilisation has always kept pace with the times? We have little to teach China. Quite the contrary: all the competitive clout wielded by the Chinese, including in trade policy, derives from the fact that China has 1.5 billion inhabitants and one Foreign Minister, 1.5 billion inhabitants and one fiscal policy, 1.5 billion inhabitants and one currency, and the Europe of 27 + 1, which constantly falters in its dealings with China, still has a lot to learn and must recover its unity.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, discussing the problems of sparsely populated areas and of the outermost islands in this Chamber – especially in the light of my parliamentary commitment to mountain regions – is the first step towards creating a network to preserve these regions, in which European citizens live in completely unique conditions and often on low incomes. These are sparsely populated areas with low population density in which there is a phenomenon of ageing populations, because the young people often leave, and a percentage of graduates that is below the national average. These criteria, particularly GDP, but there are others too, need to inspire a European support strategy for mountain regions, which have fewer services, infrastructure problems and which are particularly vulnerable due to the agricultural crisis and climate change. Mountains are places in which people live and which they study, and today they must also become a political laboratory, because they are an immense resource for cultural, clean energy and quality agriculture development, and for the quality of life that is indispensable for guaranteeing greater well-being among urban populations. Beyond the Commission, the Member States and the local authorities, it is the responsibility of local communities, too, to understand how to control their own destiny in 21st century Europe, with an integrated approach and especially active participation in decision making. I speak from experience when I say that in mountain regions, it is better to organise 10 local sporting events than one single World Cup, and this should be the working method for everybody: we should increase the number of widespread initiatives and demonstrate greater political creativity, starting with the creation within the College of Commissioners of a specific delegation for mountain regions and islands.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mr Kazak’s report which basically tells us that the European Union has a remarkable instrument in its hands to further develop its relations, including its political relations, with Turkey: the commercial policy. The crucial geo-strategic position of Turkey for the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Central Asia and the Caucasus has already been noted. There is a beautiful poem by the Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet which goes: ‘this country shaped like the head of a mare coming full gallop from far off Asia to stretch into the Mediterranean’. We would like the mare that is Turkey to be a true fulcrum of the relations with these regions, of which Turkey is one of their centres. However, to make this happen, political and trade relations with Armenia need to be stabilised, the Cyprus question needs to be closed, and I would highlight paragraph 11 of Mr Kazak’s report on the actuation and application of the customs union with regard to the part of Cyprus occupied by Turkey. So not everything is perfect. Mrs Balzani also pointed out that there are some problems, especially in the areas of counterfeiting, the defence and protection of intellectual property, and the application of the customs union to the services sector and to procurement. I would like to thank Mr Kazak. The Mediterranean is destined to change and we want to change it together with Turkey, which, according to the International Monetary Fund, is expected to experience growth of some 37% between now and 2020, which tells us all we need to know.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘acta est fabula, plaudite!
’ – ‘the play is over, applaud!’ – as Roman actors used to say at the end of a performance. The play is over and perhaps we are on the eve of its conclusion, although it may not yet be time to applaud. During this debate, we have been given important reassurances by Mr De Gucht, but we know that 64% of counterfeit goods come from China, which is not a party to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). We will therefore need to assess whether it is all worthwhile – in other words, whether we ought to sign the agreement if it does not bring any real benefits, as the Commissioner concluded. There are not many causes of concern remaining, but they are significant. A lot has been said about the Internet, and we appreciate the Commission’s efforts, but we remain vigilant. As regards access to medicines, I repeat what has already been demanded by other Members: there can be no lumping together of counterfeit medicines on the one hand and generic medicines on the other. It is vital to allow access to medicines at competitive prices, which are crucial for patients in developing countries. The question I should like to ask is whether the Doha declaration on the TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement and public health will be included at least in the preamble of the ACTA text. Lastly, as regards geographical indications, we find ourselves in a potentially paradoxical situation, because registered trademarks that might violate geographical indications would enjoy greater protection than the geographical indications themselves. Here, too, TRIPS provides a sounder basis in many respects, and we therefore call for vigilance and a firm stance. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are a little like the Ryong, the dragons of Korean mythology, which are gentle, benevolent but highly determined dragons. We are also aware that we are the European institution that is directly elected by our citizens, and we therefore call for an effective safeguard clause. Parliament is willing to conclude the agreement at first reading, but on condition that there are concrete proposals taking account of the interests of European workers and industries and especially of Parliament’s institutional prerogatives. We have six demands, which have already been put forward in part by other Members. The first one is no provisional implementation before the safeguard regulation has been adopted and before Parliament has given the agreement its approval. The second is a regional or, in any case, a flexible safeguard clause, because Europe is diverse and it is important for the agreement to be accepted and welcomed by its various stakeholders. The third and even more important demand concerns Parliament’s role in the procedures: the right to call an investigation – we have, of course, asked to extend this right to industry – the right to be given full information, and access to the online platform. The fourth concerns comitology in implementation of the regulation: the Council cannot have a greater role than Parliament. We insist on Parliament having a strong role, with a procedure – the advisory procedure – providing for a veto in cases where the Commission decides not to apply measures after an investigation. Fifthly, with regard to customs duty drawback, customs duties must be included in the safeguard clauses and must be one of the factors in any investigation and monitoring. Lastly, the sixth demand is that there needs to be monitoring of social and working conditions and environmental standards, and there needs to be a level playing field putting the Koreans and Europeans on an equal footing as regards CO2
. We are fully in favour of this Free Trade Agreement and of any Free Trade Agreement that is an instrument for stability and peace. Nobody, however, should be naive about its content, nor can the Council ignore Parliament’s role. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we do not want any more pogroms in Central Asia. Central Asia is a region that presents a high risk of interethnic conflicts. The peoples are very mixed, and the borders were drawn up under the Stalinist regime. Just consider that Kyrgyzstan has a Kyrgyz exclave in Uzbek territory, and there are four Uzbek enclaves in Kyrgyz territory, including one that is inhabited exclusively by Uzbek citizens living in Kyrgyzstan who are of Tajik nationality – this shows the complexity of the situation. We now have 300 000 people who are displaced. One hundred thousand people have taken refuge in Uzbekistan and very many have died: we do not even know how many, possibly even 2 000. What can be done? First of all, as the Commissioner stated, it is very important to guarantee justice, because – as the experience of other countries demonstrates – there can be no reconciliation without a form of justice. Therefore, we need to persevere with this committee of inquiry. The second point: while continuing to provide humanitarian aid, we also need to deal with a number of political issues. Mr Swoboda mentioned one, namely, that we must confirm to this interim government that it is, in fact, doing a good job. The referendum was a success not only from the point of view of its content, because it redresses the balance of the relationship between the Presidency and the parliament, but also because of the way in which it was organised and because of its high turnout. I would also like to understand how we Europeans should respond, if we do respond, to the OSCE request to send international police forces: shall we leave policing entirely up to the Russians, or will there also be a European contribution? The third point: what is the United States doing? It has a very large military base in Manas, but it seems to me that US influence in Central Asia is declining in general. I think it is important for us to harmonise certain issues with the US Administration as well. As for the 27 July donors’ conference mentioned by the Commissioner, I would like to understand what Europe’s priorities are here. I believe that we need to invest, above all, in education and in strengthening the civil society that exists in Kyrgyzstan. It is active, as the high turnout at the referendum showed. I would like to conclude by emphasising that the European strategy of taking a regional approach to Central Asia is certainly the right one. This is a region that needs to be considered in its entirety. I think that in the medium term, we will gradually need to apply this strategy to Afghanistan, too, because we cannot have one policy for Afghanistan and another for the countries of Central Asia – for the other countries of Central Asia. This is a paradigm case for the prevention of conflict, a little like what EU-FAST turned out not to be for Haiti, through the coordination of civil and emergency protection. We now have the legal instruments: the citizens wanted them, and we need to prove that we are up to the challenge. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I am in favour of this proposal because it aims to bring the new psychoactive substances under the same criminal law provisions as other substances controlled under the UN conventions. Psychoactive substances, like many other drugs, are a threat to society, affecting the functioning of the brain which creates symptoms such as changes in consciousness, behaviour and cognition. Tackling the distribution of psychoactive substances is not to be underestimated. Though Member States do have their own policies on tackling illicit drugs, when psychoactive substances are being distributed from one Member State to another efficient cooperation between Member States is indispensable, especially in an era when commerce and communication are no longer limited by physical and geographical boundaries.

 I support this proposal as it empowers the Union to take steps to protect cultural national treasures, in the context of the opening-up of the Union’s internal borders. This acknowledges the need to provide cultural objects special protection in the light of the rules governing the internal market. In addition this proposal aims to improve cooperation between the national authorities responsible for matters related to the return of cultural objects. For this reason it is proposing that authorities should make use of a new EU administrative cooperation instrument: the Internal Market Information system (IMI). The IMI is an electronic tool designed to improve communication and cooperation between the authorities of the Member States in the context of the implementation of internal market legislation. That will make it possible to share information about national treasures and stolen cultural objects, it will provide secure internet access, and will be used in all the EU official languages.

 I am in favour of this report because it aims to ensure the efficient monitoring of the crossing of external borders. It is fundamental to set strict rules for the search and rescue operations and on the identification of migrants intercepted at sea in order to enable Frontex to respond more effectively and to prevent deaths at sea. The “operational plan” governing Frontex-coordinated border surveillance operations must henceforth include procedures to ensure that persons needing international protection, victims of trafficking in human beings, unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable persons are identified and given appropriate help. Furthermore, through the sea operation, the participating units will address the special needs of children, victims of trafficking, persons in need of urgent medical assistance, disabled persons, persons in need of international protection and other persons in a particularly vulnerable situation throughout the sea operation.

 I support this report, because I believe in the importance of improvement of transparency and predictability of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations. The parties affected by the imposition of provisional anti-dumping and countervailing measures, in particular, importers should be made aware of the imposition of such measures. This proposal aims at modernising both the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations, entails four central changes: the removal of the lesser duty rule in anti-dumping cases where structural raw material distortions are present and in all anti-subsidy cases, the obligation for Union producers to cooperate in ex-officio investigations, the reimbursement of duties collected during expiry reviews, and the two weeks' notice before provisional duties are introduced, commonly referred to as the shipping clause. The Commission’s rationale is based on three objectives: to increase the effectiveness of the instruments, to reduce the threat of retaliation from third country, and to increase transparency and predictability.

 I voted in favour of this proposal because the fraud and related illegal activities affecting the Union’s financial interests pose a serious problem to the detriment of the Union budget and thereby the taxpayers. For this reason we call to the European institutions to ensure that public money is devoted to structural growth, fiscal consolidation and jobs. There are differences among the Member States legal and sanctioning systems. This fragmented legal framework creates incentives, for the potential perpetrators, to move across the European territory to the most favourable judicial system. I believe we should respond with a unique voice to fraud and any other activities affecting the financial interests of the Union through deterrent measures. I consider this proposal for a directive on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interest also as an important step in the field of EU Criminal Law. This area has been significantly enhanced since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and should be used to the fullest extent. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this proposal because with this text we lay down provisions for the European Parliament to set up temporary committees of inquiry to investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Community law. I consider it is of fundamental importance to guarantee inquiry committees the possibility to request documents, to summon witnesses, to hear officials and other servants of the Union or of Member States and to request experts’ reports when necessary to carry out investigations. However I believe that Parliament should lead the way in ensuring that the inquiry committee remains independent. For this reason it should closely monitor the impartiality and discretion of the examination and assure transparency and accountability throughout the investigation process. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted for this report as the development of relations between European Parliament and national parliaments is of essential importance. The resulting exchange of information is enabling the national parliaments to provide the EP with sounder evaluations and the EP to adopt decisions on the basis of broad consensus. This is ought to make it easier for European provisions to be transposed into national law rapidly and effectively by the national parliaments. Another important aspect is the so-called 'European mainstreaming' within the national parliaments, where European awareness can be achieved much more effectively by the national parliaments than by the European Parliament.

 I support this report in order to further elevate EU-Japan relations through the timely conclusion of the negotiations of a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement. Japan has been an EU strategic partner since 2003 and since has already cooperated in a number of fields such as customs cooperation and legal assistance in criminal matters, science and technology, internet security, academic and research cooperation, the peaceful use of nuclear energy, business community contacts and the promotion of people-to-people links. Moreover, the further enhancement of EU-Japan relations will aim at providing a long-standing framework for a closer relationship contributing considerably to the deepening of political, economic and cultural relations with tangible results for the citizens of both regions.

 I voted for this report as I believe we need to support the financial institutions of the Republic of Tunisia in order to sustain the population and strengthen their path onto democracy. Thanks to the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, Tunisia was the first Mediterranean country to enter in a free trade area with the Union. Unfortunately Tunisia's economy has been significantly affected by the "Arab Spring" and by the regional unrest that followed, particularly in neighbouring Libya. These events and the weak global economic environment, in particular the recession in the euro area, Tunisia's main trading and financial partner, has had a very negative impact on the Tunisian economy, leading to a slowdown in growth and generating large external and budgetary financing gaps. For this reason I think that the Union's macro-financial assistance will aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external financing situation of the country thereby supporting its economic and social development.

Moreover, given the humanitarian aspect of this important sector we need to make sure that the best possible outcomes are achieved.

As for bilateral relations between EU and UN, it is essential to support actively a comprehensive reform of the United Nations system, and especially its Security Council, in order to strengthen its legitimacy, regional representation, accountability and effectiveness.

 I voted for this report because the European Consensus on Development remains the most comprehensive basis for Union development cooperation. It sets out common objectives and principles for development and underlines the Union’s commitment to poverty eradication. The European Year for Development will also act as a catalyst for EU support by raising awareness through political public debate, building momentum and exchanging best practices between Member States, local and regional authorities and civil society. It will help foster a sense of joint responsibility and solidarity among Europeans and people in developing countries. Combating global poverty is not only a moral obligation, it will also help to build a more stable and peaceful world, reflecting the interdependence of richer and poorer countries. The Lisbon Treaty has firmly anchored development policy within Union external action in support of the Union’s interest in a stable and prosperous and more equitable world. Development policy also helps address other global challenges and contributes to the EU-2020 Strategy. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this proposal because I believe it is important that Member States get appropriate instruments to ensure the effective exercise of the Union’s rights in international trade agreements. In my opinion this is a highly important piece of legislation which will streamline the EU’s ability to act quickly and more efficiently, with measures to enforce its trading rights coming from dispute settlement decisions. I believe that in a global context where the number of retaliatory trade actions is increasing the mere existence of this recommended regulation will present a credible threat and will hopefully dissuade our trading partners from not respecting the rules of the game.

 I voted in favour of this resolution because I strongly believe that both internal political developments in Iran and the interim agreement on the nuclear issue have opened a great window of opportunity both for reforms within Iran and an improvement in its external relations with the EU. Most of all I am particularly satisfied because with this text we call for a more independent EU policy towards Iran. We also urged the Council to start a discussion on the relief of the nuclear-related sanctions. In addition I believe that Iran should be involved in the discussions for finding a solution for the Syrian crisis. On the other hand, I consider it important that, besides the nuclear deal, various topics including human rights and regional security need to be discussed between the EU and Iran. In this resolution we express our grave concern regarding the human rights situation in Iran, in particular the widespread allegations of torture, unfair trials and the high number of executions in 2013 and 2014.

 I am strongly against this resolution because its text consists of a series of attacks on Russia with the tone and language of the Cold War. This will only help to inflame the debate and to destabilise Ukraine. The resolution ignores the fact that half of Ukraine is pro-Russian and Russian-speaking and has no plans whatsoever to join the EU or NATO. To oblige Ukraine to make a choice between the EU and Russia means splitting the country and encouraging its dissolution. I believe that threatening Russia with sanctions, without leaving space for political dialogue and negotiation, is completely irresponsible. In addition I am astonished by the reckless decision of the Commission and the European Council to allocate a huge sum, EUR[nbsp ]11 billion, just for a couple of years, in favour of Ukraine. We do not have such money. And we cannot trust to have it back from a corrupt country on the brink of bankruptcy. We did not ask for any prior commitment by the Ukrainian Government in the fight against corruption, nor did we explore alternative financial aid possibilities, such as recovery of the assets of the Ukrainian oligarchs that are hidden in European banks.

 I voted in favour of that report because its aim is to prevent inconsistencies from the policies pursued by the EU and so avoid adverse repercussions for developing countries. With this text we call on the EU and its Member States to ensure that the new ‘post-2015’ framework includes a Policy Coherence for Development objective which makes it possible to develop reliable indicators to measure the progress of donors and partner countries and to assess the impact of the various policies on development. I also believe that it would be really important to establish an independent system within the Union to receive and formally process complaints by members of the public or communities affected by the Union’s policies.

 I support this report because it states that the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius demonstrated the need to review the Eastern Partnership (EaP) project. I believe that the major flaw of our eastern policy is its anti-Russian, cold war profile. This policy should be redesigned with a view to including Russia in its scope and not by antagonising it. Also, the EaP countries must be free and sovereign so as to exercise fully their right to determine their future without being subjected to undue external pressure. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I am in favour of this report because it acknowledges that the revelations concerning the US NSA surveillance programme since June 2013 have profoundly shaken the trust between the two transatlantic partners and the trust between citizens and their governments. These revelations also undermined the confidence of members of the public in the functioning of democratic institutions on both sides of the Atlantic. With this text we strongly condemn the vast and systemic blanket collection of the personal data of random people, often including intimate personal information. It is important to make it clear that the systems for indiscriminate mass surveillance by intelligence services constitute a serious interference with the fundamental rights of citizens. Privacy is not a right that is a luxury, but is the foundation stone of a free and democratic society. In addition mass surveillance has potentially severe effects on freedom of the press, thought and speech and on freedom of assembly. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I strongly support this report because I believe that the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) constitutes fundamental progress in the judicial cooperation between Member States in criminal matters. This report stresses that the EPPO should have a versatile structure and it should guarantee high standards of independence, balancing the requirement for swift decisions with careful investigations and knowledge of the national systems in which crimes are committed. In particular, it would be really important to review the judicial remedies for the determination of the competent court and for criminal activities which fall within the competence of the EPPO.

 I support this resolution because I agree that Turkey is a strategic partner for the EU and an important regional player for its wider neighbourhood. I am in favour of full EU membership for Turkey. For these reasons I am deeply concerned at the recent developments in Turkey with regard to allegations of high-level corruption. With this text we strongly regret the removal of the prosecutors and police officers in charge of the original investigations, as this goes against the fundamental principle of an independent judiciary and deeply affects the prospects for credible investigations. I consider regrettable the serious breakdown of trust between the government, the judiciary, the police and the media. Therefore, it is fundamental to urge Turkeyʼs Government to show full commitment to democratic principles and to refrain from any further interference in the investigation and prosecution of corruption.

 Mr President, I believe the discussion today is an opportunity to call on the UN Human Rights Council to follow up the implementation of the UN Secretary-General’s recommendations on the protection of human rights in Western Sahara. Morocco, as a new member of UNHRC, should acknowledge the right of the Sahrawi people to self-determination in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions and should put an end to the ongoing violation of human rights of the Sahrawi people. Also, I believe that Morocco should urgently release all Sahrawi political prisoners. For these reasons, I would like to ask all colleagues to vote in favour of all the amendments on Western Sahara proposed by the political groups. We cannot turn a blind eye to this unlawful occupation, and we cannot ignore the fact that one of our neighbouring countries is perpetrating the last case of colonial oppression in Africa.

 I support this report because this new directive will improve the legislation which prevents the conversion of the proceeds of criminal activity into legitimate funds via the financial system. To be able to do that, the operations of business registers have to be improved. Indeed, the identification of the beneficial owner of the business or the business transaction is crucial in preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. We must bear in mind that massive flows of illicit money damage the stability and reputation of the financial sector and threaten the single market as well as international development. I am persuaded that, in addition to the criminal law approach, a preventive effort via the financial system can produce results. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I strongly support this report, which denounces the continued occurrence of torture and other forms of ill-treatment throughout the world. We have the duty to reiterate at every opportunity the absolute condemnation of such acts, which are and must remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified.

 Mr. President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I share the view that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is an influential political, economic and religious actor in the Middle East and the Islamic world. It is also the world’s leading oil producer and an important partner for the EU. Nonetheless, we cannot ignore that KSA is the only country in the world in which women are not allowed to drive. With this text we call on the KSA authorities to eliminate all restrictions on women’s human rights, freedom of movement, health, education, marriage, employment opportunities, legal personality and representation in judicial processes, and all forms of discrimination against women in family law and in private and public life. Also, we ask Saudi Arabia to define a minimum age for marriage and take steps to ban child marriage in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which were both ratified by KSA.

 I am among the signatories of this text and I supported it because I believe that the growth of instability in Iraq must be addressed in a coherent and effective manner.

Iraq has seen about 1[nbsp ]500 civilian deaths from violence since the beginning of this year.

 Mr President, I have two questions for Commissioner Füle. First, I appreciated the most recent position taken by Baroness Ashton on the Ukraine-EU-Russia relationship. She says that the crisis in Ukraine was wrongly perceived as a confrontation between East and West, when the reality is that of a convergence and a synergy. Baroness Ashton accepts the concept of a Eurasian integration process where Russia and the EU cooperate in the creation of a common area of trade, stability and peace. My question is: why insist on keeping two systems of customs union alive, instead of creating just one free-trade zone?  Secondly, the Ukrainian Parliament is proposing to have in a new government three ministers who belong to the Svoboda Party, which is a neo-Nazi, anti-Semitic entity. What do you intend to do to maintain coherence with your past position on the inclusion of the Haider party in the Government of Austria? Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Mr[nbsp ]President, I am listening here to a long list of horror stories about Iraq. A few of my colleagues have mentioned what was a major origin of the horror, namely the war – one of the most stupid, expensive and useless wars of the last decades, waged in the name of exporting democracy and defending us from threats that did not exist. So, since this is a time when many of us would like Europe to play an increasing role in the world, with more intervention, accomplishing more and better things on all fronts, I would simply like to remind my colleagues that once the cameras have gone, once the spotlight has shifted, the problem may be that democracy is not there in the way that you expected. You have to contribute to rebuilding a country which is very hard to rebuild, and you have to address all the problems that are now apparent. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 This Parliament is taking a very important position on the issue of the use of armed drones. The resolution agreed upon is the first step towards the total prohibition of the use of this horrible weapon.  If there is one reason to forbid forever the use of drones it is simply the fact that they are a new weapon. We received a Nobel Prize for peace, and one of the main points is this: stop inventing new weapons; stop using technology and science to invent new weapons. So I am really surprised by all these limitations that are put by some colleagues on this issue. International law prohibits arbitrary killings, and this should be the main reason, in addition to what I have already said, for having a firm position against this new weapon. So I hope that this resolution will be the first step towards a total ban on this weapon. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted for this report because the proposal for a new legislation on confiscation of the proceeds of crime was strongly advocated by this Parliament. Thanks to this directive, Member States will have common rules for the freezing and confiscation of criminal assets through direct confiscation, value confiscation, extended confiscation, non-conviction-based confiscation and third-party confiscation. This will harmonise the EUʼs freezing and confiscation regimes, facilitating mutual trust and effective cross-border cooperation. Most of all, it will also constitute a step towards strengthening the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders which is an important aspect of the fight against cross-border serious and organised crime in the EU.

 I voted for this report because I support the creation of the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps. The Corps will fill the gaps which currently exist in humanitarian volunteer work, and will also help to cultivate public awareness and the idea of EU citizenship.

It is important to stress that the role of the volunteers must be clearly defined and that the EU Aid Volunteers initiative should be an entirely humanitarian instrument supplementing and enhancing the EU’s humanitarian action, with the best possible use of the funding provided.

 I fully support the creation of this regulation because, as the economic crisis is exacerbating poverty and social exclusion across the Union, we must take tangible actions to alleviate the needs of the most deprived persons. In fact the aim of this Fund is to establish a new, broader instrument, able to relieve the most severe forms of poverty such as food and material impoverishment. Although the budget for the Fund is still far from being enough, nonetheless it does have the potential to play an important role ensuring the predictability of the support, which is essential for the charities and civil society organisations. I also believe that it is important to stress that this kind of fund should remain a complement to national policies, as the obligation to combat and eliminate poverty remains the responsibility of Member States.

 I voted against this resolution because I could not agree less with its approach to the Ukrainian crisis. Ukraine is not an EU protectorate. It is a sovereign country with a freely elected parliament. We should stop telling them what kind of government they should have, what kind of constitution they should adopt, and when and how to hold elections. It is not the European Union’s business to ‘liberate’ Ukraine or to take sides in its political process. It is ridiculous to ask Russia to stop retaliatory measures against Ukraine and, at the same time, to threaten EU sanctions if it does not follow our diktat. I believe that the latest events in Ukraine show, instead, the need for a thorough review of the Eastern Partnership project. This policy should be redesigned with a view of including Russia in its scope and not antagonising a country which is not an enemy – because Russia is part of Europe and should be treated accordingly.

 I voted for this resolution, which endorses the Commission’s communication entitled ‘Towards the elimination of female genital mutilation’. With this tool, EU funding to prevent female genital mutilation (FGM) and to improve support for victims will be increased. FGM is a brutal practice which does not occur only in third countries but also affects women and girls living in the EU and constitutes a clear violation of fundamental rights. For this reason we call, via with this resolution, on the Member States to use all existing mechanisms to pursue, prosecute and punish any resident who has committed the crime of FGM, even if the offence was committed outside the borders of the Member State concerned.

 I strongly support the ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty by the Member States because it establishes the first global regulation for trade in conventional weapons and, to some extent, in ammunition and parts and components. The ATT will prevent the illegal trade of weapons, international terrorism and organised crime and will limit serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. The strongest point of the ATT is that state parties are obliged to establish a national control system for these transfers and to evaluate, before authorising any transfer, the risk that these arms might impair peace and security or could be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law or human rights. It is also important that not only trade of arms but other acts such as rental, licensing, grants and transfers of relevant technology also fall under the prohibition. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I believe that in the last few days Ukraine has shown up a need for a deep review of our Eastern partnership project. The major flaw of our Eastern policies is their anti-Russian, Cold War profile. This policy should be redesigned with a view to including a rational approach and not antagonising a country which is not an enemy; because Russia is part of Europe and should be treated accordingly.  Another major blunder is our excessive interference in Ukrainian political affairs. Ukraine is not an EU protectorate; it is a sovereign country with a freely-elected parliament. We should stop telling them what kind of government they should have, what kind of constitution they should adopt and when and how to have a political election.   It is not the European Union’s business to liberate Ukraine and to take sides in its political process.

 Madam President, it is time for the EU to stop taking sides and positions at every political turn in the Egyptian transition. Europe should focus its attention on the quality of institution-building. Therefore, our efforts should all be directed at strengthening the rule of law and bolstering institutions and economic reform. To that end, I attach primary importance to major issues such as asset recovery. The restitution of frozen assets is – over and above its economic significance – a strong signal against the impunity for corruption and money laundering that has so far been enjoyed by unscrupulous political leaders in Egypt and elsewhere. I would reiterate that the only way to build a sustainable democracy in Egypt is by following the path of national reconciliation and inclusive political process. Any ban, exclusion or repression directed against any political force or actor in Egypt repeats past mistakes and leads only to increased radicalism. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this proposal, which will significantly reduce bureaucracy and remove yet another obstacle to a truly transnational and borderless European Union. The regulation aims to fulfil the very important role of making formalities easier for citizens who move across borders. A large number of EU citizens live in a Member State other than their own, and this number is steadily increasing. However, administrative formalities across borders are generally considerably more complicated than within each Member State. For this reason this text aims to simplify the cross-border recognition of public documents and to reduce the number of documents needing certified translation. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I fully support this motion because wildlife crime constitutes a threat to the welfare of the animals and to the conservation of the animal and plant species concerned, putting the local ecosystems as a whole at risk. Furthermore, illicit wildlife trafficking often involves transnational organised criminal networks and is used as a source of revenue with an annual turnover of at least USD 19 billion. This is why tackling wildlife crime requires a coordinated global response at the highest political level and between enforcement agencies.

I voted for this resolution because, although equality should be a fundamental principle in the European Union, there is still discrimination concerning the access to the healthcare system. As a matter of fact, the healthcare system is in many cases restricted as a result of financial constraints. I do believe that the eHealth system could play a key role in reducing these inequalities. Nonetheless, Member States must invest in affordable, high-quality health systems. Moreover, some patients are obliged to undergo medical treatment outside their country of residence and this is not acceptable.

I would like to point out the importance of inspections and the effectiveness of unannounced inspections, which should be made regular and mandatory by Member States.

Irregularly employed workers suffer from consequences such as the fear of having an accident or being caught, which in turn affects the productivity of companies and the economy as a whole. We need to win the fight against unsafe working environments.

It is vital that more effective coordination is achieved by the EU and its Member States through joint programming, including domestic division of labour in order to avoid overlapping of actions and high transaction costs.

In addition, I believe that a new EGF criterion with the wider eligibility scope signifies a more precise answer to market needs.

This Protocol will make it easier to prevent and combat illicit trafficking in firearms by better monitoring them through marking, through import and export licensing or authorisation, and by strengthening cooperation and the exchange of information between States Parties.

I voted for this resolution which recommends to the Council, the Commission and the European External Action Service that the EU-Canada Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) be concluded swiftly. Relations between the EU and Canada are built on shared interests and values. The SPA currently under negotiation will update and revitalise this relationship. Most of all, the SPA, while codifying Canada as a strategic partner, will contribute considerably to the deepening of political, economic and cultural relations. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I supported this text because I believe that the preparation of the new multiannual financial framework is a good moment to revise the existing legal framework of Union civil protection. The number and gravity of natural and man-made disasters increased significantly in the past years, and climate change is expected to trigger even more extreme disasters in the future. For this reason cooperation needs to be strengthened between the EU and Member States in order to increase their effectiveness, in terms of prevention, preparedness and response in the event of disasters – both inside and outside the EU.

I support this resolution because it calls on the key international partners, especially the EU, to maintain their commitment to development, state-building and human security for all South-Sudanese people. The newly created South Sudan is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 50 % of the population living below the poverty line. Also, having emerged from a war and being located in an unstable region, it is in danger of failing if the international community and local stakeholders fail to cooperate in developing a joint strategy to turn it into a democratic and inclusive state. This report calls therefore for a long-term perspective and solid and stable engagement by the international community. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I voted for this report and I regret that it was not adopted. We failed to guarantee European citizens the right to have responsible and safe sex. Most of all, this Parliament voted against the right to be informed and to have access to affordable methods and healthcare services that would enable women to go through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with healthy children.

I voted for this resolution because it calls on the Commission to undertake a detailed analysis of national volunteering practices and traditions with a view to fostering a common European approach. The consolidation of a common European approach to volunteering will create more opportunities for young people’s mobility and employability by allowing them to acquire valuable skills. I believe that volunteering is a key facet of active citizenship and democracy, as well as of personal development. For this reason it is important to support the various forms of volunteering practised in the Member States through national organisations and networks of associations operating at local level.

Madam President, as a shadow rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Instrument, I would like to congratulate Mr Kukan for the huge effort and the result obtained during these difficult negotiations. With this instrument we finally have a good tool for implementation of the neighbourhood policy, especially with regard to the principle of a partnership of societies. More specifically, I hope this instrument will provide a good base for rebuilding our Eastern Partnership. The previous debate demonstrated what the major flaw of our eastern policy was: its anti-Russian profile and its cold-war and clash of civilisations inspiration. All the foreign policy instruments we are discussing are opportunities for dialogue and cooperation, not for confrontation with the ghosts of the past. Let us learn the lesson of the failed Eastern Partnership and move forward, making better use of these powerful instruments. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Morocco invaded and militarily occupied the territory of Western Sahara and has no legal title to dispose of Western Sahara’s natural resources. The EU should not be an accomplice to a colonial robbery.  If Morocco and the Commission had intended to take into account the reason behind Parliament’s rejection of the fisheries agreement, they would have included in it the need for Morocco to give to the Sahrawi people the revenues coming from the exploitation of their waters. Otherwise they could have excluded from the agreement the waters of Western Sahara, following the example of the US Congress and US Government, which do not include Western Sahara in any economic agreement with Morocco. None of that has happened. The text of the agreement contains only a generic and hypocritical reporting obligation for the Kingdom of Morocco on respect for human rights in international law. Morocco does not have the slightest credibility in this regard as it continues to practice torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, along with targeted assassination and political persecution in the occupied territories. I reiterate therefore my earlier invitation to vote against this shameful agreement. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)). Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

The question has nothing to do with the core subject of this discussion. Even the USA can do something good; what they do is not necessarily wrong. The USA has been a colony of a European power, they rebelled against it, and internationally on this kind of issue they often take exactly this position. They do not endorse colonial occupation and robberies. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

The principal aim of the European Neighbourhood Policy is to strengthen the partnership between the EU and the countries and societies of the neighbourhood, in order to build and consolidate healthy democracies, respect for human rights and the rule of law. For this reason I believe that this is the right context to discuss about the on-going violation of human rights in Western Sahara. As neighbours and partner countries, we must urge Morocco to continue negotiations for a peaceful and long-lasting solution of the Western Sahara conflict. The Sahrawi people have the right to self-determination through a democratic referendum, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. Also, I believe that Morocco should urgently release all the Sahrawi political prisoners. We cannot ignore that the rights of Sahrawis are those of us all.

According to the International Organisation for Migration, since 1993, more then 20 000 persons died at sea. I believe that Lampedusa should be a turning point for Europe and that the only way to prevent another tragedy is to adopt a coordinated approach based on solidarity and responsibility, with the support of common instruments. The EU should do everything possible to save the lives of people in danger. For this reason with this resolution we welcome the intention of the European Commission to establish a task force on the issue of migratory flows in the Mediterranean. In addition the EU must continue to offer humanitarian, financial and political assistance in crisis areas in North Africa and the Middle East in order to tackle migration and humanitarian pressures at their root cause. But most of all, the Member States must respect the principle of non-refoulement, in compliance with existing international and EU law.

I fully support this report because it strengthens the control of trade in drug precursors, especially of acetic anhydride which is often used for the illicit production of heroin.  It is very important to create an EU system of licensing and registration capable of monitoring the trade of substances which are widely used in various legitimate industrial processes, but which can also be misused by criminals. The harmonisation of licencing requirements across the EU is essential for the prevention of market fragmentation and illegal transactions.

I strongly support this report because after many years, we have finally been given the opportunity to discuss extensively and condemn the human right violations in Western Sahara. This report is really thorough in stressing the Sahrawiʼs right to self-determination and the need to organise a referendum. Unfortunately we lost an opportunity to highlight the importance of not re-instituting a fisheries agreement with Morocco while the controversy over the exploitation of Western Saharaʼs natural resources remains unresolved. In fact, to be consistent with our human right policies we should have voted for the amendment signed by almost 100 MEPs, asking the Commission to submit clear proposals on how such an agreement could be implemented in a manner acceptable to all parties concerned.

The persisting economic crisis and austerity measures in several Member States are putting the lives of EU citizens under heavy pressure due to unemployment, social exclusion and poverty. In particular, this austerity policy is having a direct adverse impact on young peoples’ prospects of gaining access to and remaining in education and employment. For this reason with this text we ask Member States to uphold the right of all persons, whatever their economic circumstances, to free and universal high-quality education. We call too on the Member States to make public expenditure and investment in education, training, and research and innovation a priority. Indeed, investing in these areas is essential for the economic recovery and global competitiveness of the Union and for progress to be made in achieving the Europe 2020 objectives.

 Madam President, Commissioner Füle, I am a strong believer in the European Neighbourhood Policy. This policy is the future of the European project and should continue to be characterised by the European spirit at its best, by which I mean tolerance, dialogue and leading by example. We should never see this policy degraded into a patronising and neocolonising endeavour. We are not carrying out an exercise of hostility and competition with Russia. We are not playing a repetition of the Great Game of two centuries ago, because Russia is also part of Europe and is not a threat to us. Likewise, we should not be perceived as a threat to them. Our inspirers and fathers are not Mackinder and Dzerzhinsky, but Schuman and Spinelli. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I support this resolution because it states that a lasting solution to the current crisis in Syria can only be achieved through a Syrian-led inclusive political process with the backing of the international community. For this reason it is fundamental to support the efforts of the European Union and of UN-Arab League Joint Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi to achieve progress in the Geneva II process and at the UN Security Council. With this text we also urge the EU and the Member States to live up to their humanitarian responsibilities and to increase their assistance to Syrian refugees. I personally strongly believe that any military intervention – with or without UN authorisation – in Syria is bound to have grave and highly unpredictable consequences and that a worsening of the situation on the ground cannot be excluded. Only a strategic, global approach articulating humanitarian and political dimensions can put an end to the violence and mass human rights violations and promote a democratic transition in Syria.

I support this text because after the military coup of July Egypt is in a very unstable and worrying situation. The political tensions continue to provoke violent clashes, which have resulted in more than 1 000 deaths and many more injured. I am firmly convinced that any exclusion or prosecution against a democratic political force or actor in Egypt can only lead to increased radicalism. We need to condemn in the stronger possible terms the disproportionate use of force against the protesters without penalising the Egyptian population while suspending aid to the country. In addition, with this resolution we urge the EU to proceed without delay to establish an EU mechanism providing legal and technical assistance to Arab Spring countries in the process of asset recovery. This instrument, already supported by this Parliament on several occasions, was delayed because of the turmoil in Egypt. It is vital to bear in mind that asset recovery has a highly symbolic value and may contribute largely to restoring accountability, creating stability and building solid institutions in the spirit of democracy and the rule of law in the partner countries concerned.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself for the umpteenth time – this is the third year of my term of office – and time and again we deal with the same problems as if it were the first time. And this year, as in every other year, we are once again witnessing a mass slaughter. The Mediterranean has now become an open mass grave. It is also the tomb of civilisation and, above all, the tomb of the hopes of thousands of people fleeing – men, women and children as has just been mentioned – fleeing from their countries and fleeing, above all, from civil and religious persecution. Europe has major responsibilities because it has negotiated with murderers like Gaddafi, who have used these poor martyrs – and Gaddafi did so precisely to raise the stakes and at the very moment Europe was in negotiations with Libya. Every time, we find ourselves debating the issue as if it were the first time. What I want to know is what are we planning to do about it? What actual responses are we going to give our citizens? Yet again, this is another tragedy and, as Mr Moraes quite rightly has pointed out, the Italian Government may have changed, but we still have to give answers. Sonia Alfano,

Mr President, I would like to offer you my best wishes on your new position. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy that today, we are debating in plenary a resolution that stems from the many petitions that reach the European Parliament, and that refers specifically to the question of waste. These petitions demonstrate the concern of European citizens about the harm done to the environment, human health and the economy by waste management practices prevalent in various areas in Europe. Even though I agree with the overall structure of the resolution, I am rather dissatisfied with how some of its passages address the issue of incinerators. At times, it seems that thanks to technology, any problem related to public health and the environment has been completely overcome. Until last year, right here, we were hearing the same words about nuclear power plants. Today, however, in this same Chamber, it is difficult to find anyone willing to defend the nuclear industry. Is it possible that politics is simply unable to take a long-term view? Do we really have to wait for more epidemiological studies confirming the increased cancer rates already found throughout populations living near incinerators? This is not the NIMBY syndrome, but simply the citizens defending their right to health. There are alternatives that are virtuous and create employment. We must implement the spirit of the Waste Management Directive strictly, with a waste cycle based on the concepts of reduction, reuse and recycling. Landfill and incineration are residual, hierarchically inferior options, resorted to only after everything else possible has been done. If there was a political will to that effect, incinerators would be a nice memory. I think that Parliament should take a more advanced stance and better protect its citizens in this area. I hope that the European Commission will propose stricter criteria and procedures for building incinerators and opening landfill sites, and encourage serious ‘zero waste’ policies in all Member States.

Madam President, I first of all wish to thank Mr Cashman for his excellent work and, in particular, for his great patience. As we all know, democracy is based on making legislative work public, on the transparency of the decision-making process, and on the people’s right to make informed decisions. For this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Treaties have proclaimed the fundamental right to access documents and information. This right must be guaranteed for all citizens, from local to international levels, in order to ensure that the institutions carry out the task for which they were created: to work on the citizens’ behalf in a transparent manner. Transparency is essential to prevent and combat corruption and the infiltration of the institutions at all levels by organised crime and powerful interests. I am particularly satisfied because the report on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding access to documents has accepted some important amendments which I submitted, in particular, those on financial and budgetary transparency, on the beneficiaries of European funds, on how EU money is spent, and on how European policies are implemented, all of which can be accessed via a database on the Internet. Other amendments submitted by me are included in the report, establishing rules for accessing information in electronic format contained in European databases, rules to limit exceptions to document access, especially when they refer to European legislative procedures, and rules for overriding the power of Member States to veto the publication of documents. The ALDE Group will therefore vote in favour of the Cashman report and I hope that the majority of this Parliament will support it, despite the opposition of some Members who have induced their groups to follow the interests of economic bureaucratic and industrial lobbies or those entrenched in the defence of the class and its secrets. The ALDE Group moreover asks the European Commission and Council to accept the proposals of the European Parliament and, under the Danish Presidency, to launch negotiations so as to finally take the necessary steps forward to assert the fundamental and democratic right of citizens to acquire the knowledge they require in order to make their decisions.

 Madam President, Commissioner, there are many facts that unfortunately lead us to the conclusion that human rights and freedom of expression are constantly being violated in Kazakhstan. I can give an actual example, to back up my statement. On 26 October 2011, cameraman Asan Amilov and journalist Orken Bizenov were the victims of an armed attack in the district of Mańğystau. Their newspaper Stan.kz
 first went into print in March 2007 with a network of correspondents throughout Central Asia, providing prompt and professional information about what was going on in Kazakhstan and its neighbouring countries, and winning a positive response from the people. It is surely no coincidence that the attackers took the journalists’ laptop, which contained important video footage from the strikes of the oil company workers in Mańğystau. This is just the latest of many examples of intimidation which all too often involve the public authorities. I call on the Commission to take a decisive stance in condemning such practices and to take their attempts to violate the freedom of the press into due consideration in the EU’s negotiations with these countries. Finally, I support the proposal to organise a round table at EU level between the Kazakhstan authorities, the workers’ representatives in the province of Mańğystau and the oil company representatives, in order to find a solution to the serious situation that emerged with the strikes of May 2011.

If Parliament adopts this report today, we will be giving due recognition, and be able to dedicate this work, to all the innocent victims of organised crime and mafias. Their memory, the memory of those who paid with their lives for choosing not to give in to the foulness of moral compromise must guide us, and it compels us to send strong, unequivocal signals, such as the one I hope we are about to send to Europe’s citizens today.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with the work that has been achieved with the political groups, particularly the shadow rapporteurs: Mr Iacolino for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Mr Crocetta for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Mr Albrecht for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mr Kirkhope for the European Conservatives and Reformists and Mr de Jong for the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. Their noteworthy contributions were decisive in arriving at an advanced and ambitious final draft. Organised crime and mafias are one of the main threats to the security and freedoms of the people of Europe. For the first time in European political history, an official document is making explicit reference to mafias and to the need for specific, transnational measures to fight them. It is crucial to focus on organised crime and mafias because, as the Europol reports show, organised criminal groups are cropping up everywhere; they are taking root in the Member States and have heavily infiltrated the economy, finance, politics and all levels of government. With this report, Parliament is proposing a concrete political line of attack, a serious, coordinated intervention and a treatment that is at last a match for the seriousness of the situation. This treatment is based on the intelligence gathering and analyses of those who fight organised crime every day. I take this opportunity to thank the judges, police representatives, researchers and witnesses who have contributed their precious experience to drawing up the definitive solutions proposed here. In a spirit of service and self-denial, they represent their Member States on a daily basis in an unequal fight against criminal organisations. What drives criminal organisations is profit. That is why in the report, we have prioritised attacking assets that can be directly or indirectly traced back to organised crime. We are therefore looking forward with extreme interest to the proposal for a directive that the Commission is due to submit in the coming months on a European body of law to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate criminal assets. I am therefore very happy to see Commissioner Reding here, and I would like to put Parliament’s specific political wishes to her. We ask for European rules to allow so-called extended confiscation and effective preventive measures, such as non conviction-based confiscation; we ask for rules to allow the targeting of assets held by front persons; and, above all, we call for rules to use confiscated assets for social purposes, so as to turn it into a cultural operation with the full involvement of civil society, without which merely fighting organised crime would be a wasted effort. To give an idea of the importance of the document to be voted on tomorrow, I will give a list of the measures requested at European level: harmonisation of legislation on organised crime; rules for greater victim protection; extension of the offence of mafia association to all Member States; greater coordination and cooperation between Europol, Eurojust and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and with national authorities; improved judicial cooperation and full implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions; rules on transparency and prevention to stop public funds ending up in the hands of organised criminals; rules to counter financial crime and money laundering; and rules to prevent people convicted of offences connected with organised crime from standing in European elections. We are absolutely sure about one thing, Commissioner: these demands, which we vigorously called for in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and which we are about to adopt here, will not remain mere words. We will use every means at our disposal to put them into practice, in line with the Treaties in force which, fully in accordance with the democratic nature of the European Union, assign to the national parliaments and the European Parliament the fundamental role of guiding and assessing policy in the area of freedom, security and justice so as to protect the interests of the people of Europe. That is why we hope the Commission will immediately acknowledge the political importance and significance of this House’s position. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I would like to dedicate this work – this first step that Parliament is about to take – to all the innocent victims of organised crime and mafias. Their memory, the memory of those who paid with their lives for choosing not to give in to the foulness of moral compromise, must guide us, and it compels us to send out strong, unequivocal signals, such as the one I hope we will send to the people of Europe tomorrow.

 Mr President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, the first meeting of the EU-Tunisia task force, which is charged with support for the transition to democracy and economic recovery, took place today. This year, Europe’s financial commitment was doubled, and obviously I welcome this, because Tunisia, with which we have a privileged partnership, has also agreed to accept sub-Saharan refugees fleeing from the war in Libya. The European Union, which has often reaffirmed its commitment to the refugees, must without fail support and aid Tunisia to manage these migration flows while fully respecting human rights. Norway, although not part of the European Union, has agreed to accommodate more than 300 refugees, while EU Member States have agreed to accommodate fewer than 400 refugees in total. I consider this to be a deplorable and shameful attitude, a real insult to the principle of solidarity that should underpin the European Union’s Mediterranean policy. I should remind you, what is more, that these refugees are currently confined in camps in intolerable conditions. This morning in this very Chamber the European Parliament approved by a large majority an allocation of EUR 43.9 million for managing the migrant and refugee flows arising from repression by authoritarian regimes and movements linked to the Arab Spring. These additional funds will be used to assist the Member States most affected by these flows and to reinforce marine patrols by Frontex. Let us reaffirm our assent to a Europe committed as much to the promotion of human rights as to the management of migration flows, and let us reject the idea of a fortress Europe that is xenophobic and closed. Today, the European Union is paying the price of its previous support for the dictatorial regimes of North Africa. Our former friends Gaddafi and Ben Ali have fallen or are falling and their people are fleeing repression. I should like to know what stage the joint EU resettlement programme, currently blocked in the Council, has reached. I am asking you, Commissioner, whom I know to be extremely sensitive and pro-active, how, in the current situation, can the European Union make a concrete commitment with regard to this humanitarian emergency? In conclusion, I am taking the opportunity of asking the Commission whether it is aware of what is happening in Palermo, where the Italian authorities are forcing 250 migrants to remain aboard a ship, without any provision authorising their detention, and denying them their right to freedom and to communicate with the outside world. Thanks to numerous reports presented to the Public Prosecutor’s Office at Palermo by many organisations in Palermo and Sicily fighting for human rights, the Palermo Public Prosecutor has just opened an investigation. This event follows some extremely serious facts that took place at Lampedusa last week, where the situation is out of control and where the safety of both the local population and that of the migrants themselves is at risk.

 Mr President, I would like to say something about the botched attempt at evacuation that took place in Parliament in Brussels last week. I think what happened was totally against the rules, because nobody came round to our rooms to warn us and tell us that we had to leave and evacuate the building, and then outside Parliament we were all free to do whatever we liked. I would therefore like to know how much this Parliament spends every year on evacuation procedures and Parliament’s safety. I would expect an institution of this kind to have somewhat stricter rules, at the very least. Sonia Alfano,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have studied the anti-corruption package presented by the Commission in June extremely carefully, and I have to say that I am impressed with the content of the package. It is a good starting point, and all the European institutions, especially the European Parliament, must strive to achieve real, measurable results quickly. Today corruption is the main route by which organised crime penetrates the legal economy and the public sector. Corruption creates criminal systems, and dangerous connections between entrepreneurs, politicians and public officials. It is estimated that the cost of corruption in Europe is some EUR 120 billion. I have to say that this is a conservative estimate given that in my country, Italy, alone, corruption accounts for EUR 60 billion a year, practically the amount of a financial package that at the moment would save my country from default. With regard to the June communication and the proposals presented, I would like to ask the Commission what measures it intends to propose to improve the fight against corruption in the private sector. Can it give us some details about how it intends to improve financial investigations? What measures does it intend to propose to combat political corruption, and what point have the assessments of the review of the tender directive to combat conflicts of interest and of the draft directive for regulating concessions reached? As Mr Albrecht has already said, this Parliament and these institutions have already been working on equally important problems, such as terrorism, for some time. This directive, the directive on corruption, gives ample space and visibility, and above all it gives us the chance to consider and to understand once and for all the extent to which organised crime is firmly entrenched in all 27 Member States. In any case, Commissioner, this is what you said exactly one year ago, and these answers are crucial for us, especially considering the fact that in a month’s time we will be voting on the report on organised crime in Europe, for which I am the rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment of the Frontex Regulation, on which we are voting today, is designed to strengthen the European Agency, endowing it with greater operational capabilities and strengthening the enforcement of the fundamental rights of refugees and asylum seekers but, above all, the ban on refoulement. The creation of a fundamental rights officer role within the Frontex Management Board and the requirement for Member States to show solidarity with each other are steps in that direction. The reform of Frontex must enable us to tackle the real migration-related emergencies in Europe. Only today, the Financial Times
 reports that approximately 85% of the 104 000 migrants who entered the EU illegally in 2010 arrived via Greece, and not via Italy or Malta, and unfortunately the same will be true in 2012. Only if Frontex fully respects migrants’ human rights and helps to prevent the huge number of deaths in the Mediterranean, which has now become a burial ground in which the lives and hopes of people fleeing poverty, oppression and desperation are extinguished, will we be able to say that we are on the right track. This must be Frontex’s goal, and the European Parliament will have to monitor the progress made in this regard. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Ms Hautala and Ms Sargentini on their excellent work. Through the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, transparency has become a basic right of European citizens. We are on the right track, but unfortunately, even in this day and age, there is great resistance when we talk about transparency. In my opinion, there is no middle way: anyone against full transparency obviously has something to hide and would prefer for decisions to be taken out of sight from citizens and the press. The Commission refuses to accept the proposals to revise the regulation on access to documents, which were put forward by Parliament in the report by Mr Cashman and provide for greater transparency. The Council, meanwhile, systematically refuses to make the identities of Member States known during discussions and votes in their meetings. The legal services of the Commission, the Council and Parliament continue to use excuses to hide their legal opinions, despite the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the Turco
 case. Even in Parliament, there is substantial resistance to guaranteeing access to information for citizens, particularly with regard to the activities of Members and the expenditure of this House and its Members. The so-called Galvin report has finally been published, though unfortunately, the names are missing from it. I believe that transparency is one of democracy’s basic tools for combating abuses of power, waste and corruption, and for forging closer relationships between citizens and institutions. In my view, the report by Ms Hautala and Ms Sargentini works along these same lines and hence it deserves the maximum support. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I shall be voting in favour of this report. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday 60 000 Italians demonstrated in Val di Susa against the absurd project to build the Lyon-Turin high-speed rail link (‘TAV’). As an MEP I condemn all forms of violence, whether the violence of the rioters who created disorder yesterday or the violence of the Italian members of parliament and ministers who today tried to liken the peaceful ‘No TAV’ people to the ‘Black Bloc’. Everyone knows that the high-speed rail link in Val di Susa will never be built. Can an area be militarised for 20 years? This is the result of failing to listen to the people and should be a lesson to the EU. Works are done with the citizens for the citizens, not for party political committees on the left and right. The deadlines imposed by the Commission for the provision of the European contribution, amounting to EUR 662 million, have expired. Mr Kallas should decide to withdraw the funding immediately. With these extensions, Italy is enjoying privileges not granted to other Member States. Therefore, I urge the Committee on Petitions to send a delegation to Val di Susa as soon as possible to establish what is happening and listen to local people. The European Parliament should not abandon these citizens and their arguments. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is the first instrument implemented in the European Union that puts into practice the principle of mutual recognition of criminal judgments. That instrument is fundamentally important now and should remain so, especially for fighting mafia groups and organised crime. In the report on organised crime, for which I am the rapporteur in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we are proposing a series of considerations and requests concerning the European Arrest Warrant. One of the main requests is for the EAW to be strengthened and better enforced by the Member States, bearing in mind the requirements and the specific nature of the fight against organised crime. I therefore ask the Commission how it intends to proceed and whether it intends to submit a proposal to remove the Member States’ discretion in the transposition of Articles 3 and 4 of the framework decision, concerning the grounds for mandatory non-execution and optional non-execution. With regard to the grounds for optional non-execution, I also ask whether it may not be appropriate to restrict them in the case of offences typically attributable to organised crime, including the offence of association with a mafia organisation, for which double criminality should not apply anyway.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before the vote, I should like to take a few moments to remind the House, the Council and the European Commission that two years ago, there was an earthquake in L’Aquila in which 309 people died and over 1 650 people were injured. Now I have raised the matter, I will send all MEPs today a video that was filmed in L’Aquila on 13 January. I urge all colleagues to look at it because the citizens of L’Aquila are waiting for a strong response from Europe. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the emergency situation is teaching the European policy on asylum and immigration a serious lesson It is again evident that the EU does not have a legislative and operational framework that enables it to cope with extraordinary but not unforeseeable events, such as the events of recent months in North Africa. Lampedusa, Italy and Southern Italy are paying for these mistakes, but the main ones to pay are the refugees who are received in such an inhumane manner. Despite Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and the principle of equitable sharing of solidarity, all the countries are actually concerned only with their own affairs and the attitude of France, which shares a border with Italy, is unacceptable in the current European scenario. In this regard, I urge the Commission to consider the possibility of seeking an explanation from the French Government. For years, the EU has entered into agreements with third countries run by dictatorships, funding their activities and putting business interests before democratic requirements. Europe has remained silent before the Libyan raids: does it also intend to remain silent in the face of the unsustainable situation of the tent camps? Of course, we all agree that we cannot make deals with Colonel Gaddafi, yet, a few months ago, I did not hear any objections to the Italy-Libya treaty, which has led to the immigration issue being addressed in the most inhuman way. Today, President Berlusconi tried to use the same approach with Tunisia, offering money. Perhaps, though, the new Tunisian Government has learned its lesson. Yet, like it or not, it is the responsibility of the EU and the 27 Member States to take action, bearing in mind the overriding priority of international solidarity and the protection of human rights. For this reason, I hope that the European Commission proposes the introduction of the emergency procedure laid down in Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection as soon as possible, and that this proposal is adopted by the Council in the near future, because otherwise it will be in vain. I also call for a parliamentary delegation, not a delegation of political groups, to be sent to Lampedusa to verify both the humanitarian conditions of the immigrants and the non-refoulement
 principle. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to speak before you highlighted Parliament’s determination to call for the resignation of the other MEP, the last MEP, who has not yet resigned. I thank you and thank Parliament for making a firm and determined decision to implement a zero-tolerance policy because this is all about the credibility of everyone in this House, and above all we must remember that we represent 500 million citizens and not the lobbies, thank you.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as some have said, Baroness Ashton, you have shown great courage by taking the bull by the horns in this case, but I think there are a number of basic steps to be taken. Meanwhile, you have spoken about bringing the guilty parties to justice. Let us call them by their real name: we need to bring Mr Gaddafi to justice. You also spoke about violence. Instead, I think it is right to say that genocide is taking over in these territories, yet again. We cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand. I think the first thing we need to do is to recognise the Libyan National Council, a transitional council. We must have an interlocutor; we cannot carry on speaking only of sharply reduced humanitarian aid. There is no doubt that we must all speak up for a no-fly zone. We cannot continue accepting the vetoes of China and Russia, countries that are run by dictators. China censors the Internet while Russia kills journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya. I think that right now, the first thing to do is to begin setting out our stall and recognise the Libyan National Council. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that events in the Middle East have made it clear to the European institutions that they cannot continue to ignore the violation of fundamental rights and of national constitutions. Please forgive me but I must again report a shameful action by the ruling majority in Italy, which would like to save Mr Berlusconi from the trials that have just begun over serious crimes such as extortion and exploitation of child prostitution. The Italian majority, in fact, called on the Constitutional Court to decide which court should try Mr Berlusconi. Certainly, the Constitutional Court will throw out the request of a judge on a personal basis, but we must not continue to ignore Mr Berlusconi’s umpteenth attack on Italian democracy and the independence of the Italian judiciary. Many colleagues have already signed a petition to send out a strong signal that will reach the Italian people from their own MEPs. It is a curious coincidence, Mr President, that while Mr Berlusconi has been attacking the judiciary for years, the Minister for Justice, Mr Alfano, has ingenuously come to Strasbourg to describe the plan for making justice efficient and cannot find a single moment to meet the European Parliament. Perhaps he is afraid to face uncomfortable questions from the representatives of the people concerning the Italian justice system and the way people are trying to destroy its independence?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so immediately willing and far-sighted in offering Italy assistance, although the assistance was rejected in the first instance by the Italian Government itself. Commissioner, you have rightly stressed the need to support Tunisia at this time of democratic transition. However, I wonder, and I ask you all: what has happened to the money that Europe has been pouring into Tunisia all these years and which it is still pouring into Libya, which – as we know – are democratic regimes? Therefore, it is now wonderful and amazing to cheer this awakening of the Tunisian people, although I wonder how on earth all that money was ever granted. If the Libyans woke up tomorrow, what conclusion would we draw from that? Would we have thought yet again that we had been funding democratic regimes, only to realise the next day that we had been implementing a disastrous policy instead? I ask myself, Commissioner, how on earth Europe has kept quiet about this democratic awakening, while only the United States has offered strong guidance in this respect. I would like to pick up on what Mr Portas and Mr Tavares said. They pointed out, extraordinarily, that in countries like Tunisia, emigration is viewed as a crime. To begin with, regarding all the people who have landed on Lampedusa – and I would remind Mr Madlener that they are not Libyans but Tunisians, although that is hardly important because Libyans will soon be arriving as well – who will decide whether they are refugees or not, given that a situation of extreme confusion reigns in Tunisia at the moment? Above all, however, how will we feel if we repatriate these people, in the knowledge that they will be thrown into prison as soon as they arrive? These, then, are the points that I believe we should be thinking about, and, above all, we should realise that racist policies like those implemented by the Italian Government have unfortunately produced only highly negative results.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is barely credible for the European institutions to still want to conclude a framework agreement with a dictatorship like Libya. We cannot go on saying that Libya has very important trading relations with European Union Member States and acts as a partner for the European Union in the Mediterranean basin, and putting respect for human rights as a secondary issue. The primary condition for us to be able to start a credible dialogue with Libya is for that country to ratify the Geneva Convention. We cannot barter economic interests for human lives: not just the lives of Libyan citizens, but also of people from other countries who are fleeing civil wars and religious persecution and pass through Libya only to find death and horrendous torture. We have a duty not to forget the thousands of calls for help made by people held in Libyan prisons. We cannot forget the horrors that Gandufa prison revealed to us. Libyan citizens do not enjoy many political and civil rights, such as freedom of expression, assembly and association. The oral amendment by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which seeks to replace the term ‘treaty’ in recital B with ‘agreements between Italy and Libya on joint coastal patrols’ is absolutely unacceptable, and the Italian delegation from Italia dei Valori
 will vote against it. The agreement between Italy and Libya is much more complex: it is a treaty with precise conditions regarding more complex issues than joint coastal patrols. For the European Parliament to remain credible, it needs to call a spade a spade, even if that may be embarrassing. A separate discourse needs to be entered into for the UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency, which is unable to carry out its work in Libya and is accused by the Libyan regime of incredible abuses and crimes. Are these the bases on which agreements should be conducted? We cannot deal with either terrorists or dictators. We are the European Parliament, not the board of directors of an economic giant.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, Directive 2001/77/EC lays down the definition of renewable energy sources with the aim of identifying those for which public incentives may be provided. Renewable energy sources exclude the incineration of the non-biodegradable part of waste. Since 1992, Italy has provided incentives by increasing its citizens’ energy bills and building incinerators, which are scientifically proven to be bad for people’s health and the environment and which the European Union has thus classified as a residual integrated waste management option. Two infringement procedures have been launched with regard to these incentives and, despite formal legislative intervention, in Italy, waste incineration is still being encouraged as a source of renewable energy, with the Acerra case being just one example of this. I realise that it may be difficult for you to remember the details of the situation concerning the CIP 6, which is why I have submitted a written question. However, I would ask you to confirm that incentives may not be provided for the incineration of non-biodegradable waste as a source of renewable energy and that there are no derogations in place for this. I would also like to know whether it is not considered inconsistent for the Waste Directive to establish incineration as a residual waste disposal option, while Directive 2001/77/EC encourages it as a form of renewable energy. Does the Commission intend to review this matter? Sonia Alfano,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the Italian Government’s propaganda, which was soon disproved by the Commission, the waste crisis in Campania is a structural problem that is anything but resolved. Questionable lists aside, we need to realise one thing: the people of Campania continue to live – and die – surrounded by waste. The local, regional and national politicians, on the right and on the left, have an enormous responsibility. The task of solving the problem cannot be offloaded on to the citizens, who are already suffering from completely unhealthy living conditions. The European Union must insist that a worthy solution is found, or else its intervention will have been in vain. The construction of incinerators, which, by the way, are financed as renewable energy sources and thereby infringe current European legislation, will not solve the issue. The waste would be turned into ash, causing harmful and deadly emissions. Pursuant to the Waste Directive, incinerators shall be the last option in a hierarchy of integrated waste systems that presents virtuous alternatives that have no public health or environmental impact but instead create employment. As far as Mafia infiltration is concerned, I feel it should be acknowledged that, while Mafia infiltration, particularly in the field of waste, does happen in the south, it happens primarily in the north. This has been especially true over the last few years. I therefore have three questions for the Commission: what action does it intend to take to ensure that the solution to the problem does not affect people’s health, and how does it intend to prevent decisions from being imposed on the public and areas from actually becoming militarised? Does it think that the immediate launch of a cancer registry for the entire region should be one of the conditions for closing the infringement procedure? What is the Commission’s assessment of Law No 210 of 2008 and, in particular, of Article 9 on incentives for the construction of incinerators, in which European legislation on State aid is clearly infringed?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a number of years, many families in Italy and just as many Romanian children have been suffering the consequences of Romania’s block on international adoptions. The Hague Convention is the benchmark framework to be implemented uniformly in all countries of the European Union, and Romania needs to make an effort to adjust to it. If Romania believes that the block on international adoptions works to protect children – for example, from the risk that a market for the illegal trafficking of children would be created – it must also deal with this problem with the help of the European Union, by toughening up controls and introducing strict regulations. However, we need to make an effort to ensure that many respectable families can adopt children, who deserve a second chance for a happy childhood. I would therefore ask the Commission how it intends to support a possible commitment from Romania to remove the moratorium on international adoptions and, furthermore, I should like to know the Commission’s position on the possibility of creating a European adoption agency, including in the light of the studies carried out.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 and 14 January, a referendum was held at the Fiat plant at Mirafiori in which both blue- and white-collar workers were asked to vote for or against the recovery plan for the plant in Turin. The plan is based on a new collective agreement that undermines workers’ fundamental rights relating to illness and strike action, and even the midday break during eight hours’ work on an assembly line. The referendum is illegitimate because the chief executive officer, Mr Marchionne, has threatened workers that if the agreement is rejected, the business is likely to abandon manufacturing in Italy and move elsewhere. This strategy of fear, of unbridled capitalism without consideration for rules or rights, was supported by the government and even by much of the Democratic Party, an opposition party that has its roots in the Italian Communist Party. The only unions to oppose the agreement were the Italian Federation of Metalworkers (FIOM) and the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL), and they were ousted from the union representation. In any case, the referendum passed with just 54% of the votes. As a result of this agreement, workers’ rights in Italy have slipped back several decades. Europe should know this and bear it in mind.

 I think it was a good idea for the Commission to attend Parliament today to report on the ban on the use of unenriched cages for laying hens, which will enter into force from January 2012. The implementation data are not very encouraging and, hence, very tough action is required against Member States that, out of indolence, have not made any progress for a while. The prohibition of these cages has been known since 1999, and those Member States that joined later were perfectly aware of having to take action on this issue according to precise timescales. Delay is unacceptable. Deadlines must be respected to make the European Union’s actions credible. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union requires the EU to enforce its policies, bearing in mind the welfare of animals as sentient beings. We must not always hide behind the problem of competitiveness, which should not be considered as an issue of quantity and prices but, above all, of quality, environmental sustainability and ethics, too. The critical and aware consumer must be at the heart of a new economic model that the EU should spearhead. I therefore hope that the Commission will proceed swiftly and determinedly to implement Council Directive 1999/74/EC, to protect both animals and consumers. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been following the legislative procedure for the European citizens’ initiative very closely and I am happy – partly on the basis of the statements by the Council and the Commission – that the first petitions will be launched a year from now. I am also proud to be able to announce to the European Parliament that in Italy a broad grassroots movement of citizens, associations and committees has sprung up in the wake of the approval of the outrageous directive on animal research. This movement will not sit on its hands this year, but will work to prepare a proposal for the Commission: a proposal to give the European Union modern and civilised laws and that says ‘no’ to animal testing – a cruel and scientifically ineffective practice – while strongly encouraging alternative methods. Saying ‘no’ to vivisection must be an objective of the European Union, since it is a desire of its citizens. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is well known that the activities of the Italian Government represent a constant violation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We only need to think of the agreement between Italy and Libya, which succeeded in infringing dozens of articles of the Charter, or the proposed ‘bavaglio
’ law that set out to gag the press and the legal system. We are talking about a government supported by a parliament elected in an undemocratic manner, without allowing citizens the chance to express a preference, a government that yesterday won a vote of confidence with votes from the opposition benches from Members of Parliament who publicly admitted that they had been approached with promises of standing at future elections and cash for votes.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union cannot back down from the energy challenge that will decide the fate of the planet. We must dispel the myth that the economic development of a country is closely tied to an increase in energy consumption. Europe must pioneer a new sustainable economic model, based on lower use of resources, including energy, with greater productivity. We must therefore break the link between economic growth and an increase in energy sold to industries and the public and instead link it to an increase in energy services that create employment and energy efficiency. For these reasons, I believe that energy efficiency represents a priority for the future of the EU, in both economic and environmental terms, and I hope that the Commission will immediately take the necessary measures to implement the binding objectives that Parliament established today.

 Mr President, notwithstanding the European Convention on Human Rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union and the national constitutions, serious violations of human rights persist on a daily basis in the European Union and in the Member States. In my country – Italy – there is a regime in force in which freedom of the press is violated, political parties take part in elections by submitting fake signatures, State secrecy covers up violent attacks (including by the Mafia), our Prime Minister – though not for much longer, we hope – profits from international cooperation with regimes like those in Russia and Libya, as was also confirmed by WikiLeaks. The European Union cannot allow itself to turn a blind eye to all of this. For these reasons, I support the report, which contains many of the amendments submitted by me and approved in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Amongst these, I should like to single out paragraphs 20 and 40, which call for human rights violations to be monitored and penalised, and for national legislative proposals with the potential to violate human rights to be frozen before they become law, until the EU approves them. I also supported the incentive to use Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union to address human rights violations and to bolster the mandate of the Agency for Fundamental Rights. The report makes numerous positive references to minorities, rights, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, immigrants and asylum seekers, freedom of the press and social rights. For these reasons, I would urge my fellow Members to vote in favour of the report. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciate the work carried out by the two rapporteurs. However, the problem with this draft directive is that it is based on the most usual kind of stalking, in which a person has been a victim of violence by another and therefore must be defended against a repeat of whatever physical or mental abuse took place. Obviously, this is a matter of fundamental importance for hundreds of thousands of women in the European Union and therefore I fully support its content. Unfortunately, however, these measures do not take into account the victims of organised crime who, in the majority of cases, do not need to be defended from an identified or identifiable person, but from organisations against which a restraining order certainly cannot be applied. Therefore, I think that the European Parliament should regard this directive as a first step in implementing the Stockholm Programme, which talks expressly about measures to protect the victims of criminal activity, and it seems to me that Mrs Jiménez and Commissioner Reding are of the same mind. I appeal to the European Commission to ensure that the package of measures to protect victims, which is planned for 2011, also protects victims of organised crime and victims injured in the course of duty on a European level.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that, in the final version of the report, involvement in criminal organisations for offences relating to the trafficking of human beings is an aggravating factor that doubles the minimum penalties from five to ten years in prison. In addition, Article 6a makes explicit reference to the seizure and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds from this kind of offence. This approach – which I believe is absolutely right and I hope may also be carried over to other legislation – looks the facts in the face and recognises that the trafficking of people for various forms of exploitation, such as, for example, prostitution, criminal activities and organ trafficking, is carried out by international criminal organisations. I am also pleased with the provisions of Article 7, which directs Member States not to prosecute people for their involvement in criminal activities that they have been compelled to commit as victims of trafficking. Often, in fact, those who suffer the violence of trafficking not only suffer injuries, but also the insult of being incriminated for doing what they were compelled to do, prostitution being a typical example. Therefore, I support the report and I should like to thank the two rapporteurs. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 There is nothing more inhuman than exploiting the lives of other living beings for profit, infringing every fundamental right. Trafficking in human beings is one of the basest activities in history; it is a widespread and highly complex phenomenon. I am pleased that Parliament has approved at first reading the proposal for a directive on trafficking in human beings. This is a significant step forward in combating the phenomenon, which is the main activity of a large number of international criminal organisations. The most important point is the recognition that organised crime is the main problem to tackle. The EU is finally making a real, explicit distinction between crime and organised crime, because the latter is a truly separate issue. There are many other positive elements such as a broader definition of exploitation, greater protection for victims and the rule stipulating that victims of trafficking shall not be charged for crimes they have been forced to commit as a result of violence or the threat of violence against them. As Amnesty International points out, often women who are victims of trafficking are arrested for prostitution, or are not guaranteed full access to justice. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 As the statements by the government representatives of numerous States demonstrate, the extraordinary zeal with which Julian Assange is being investigated is clearly designed to punish him and WikiLeaks for having revealed certain top secrets to the world, such as the concerns of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who asked the US embassies in Rome and Moscow for information on any personal investments of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Putin that might influence the foreign or economic policies of their respective countries. Mr Berlusconi is described as Mr Putin’s spokesman in Europe. Clearly, what is taking place here is the unprecedented punishment and persecution of a man and an organisation whose only crime is to have made the world aware of certain grey areas that put governments in an uncomfortable position. Hence, it is our duty to protect the freedom of WikiLeaks and to guarantee fair treatment for Julian Assange, who should pay for his crimes, if proven, in a fair trial. I therefore call on the Commission to state its position on the WikiLeaks affair and to explain how it intends to monitor the situation so that this affair is not used to clamp down on freedom of information and to impose restrictions on the Internet, which has once again proved to be an exceptionally powerful democratic instrument, and which must therefore be protected.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the energy efficiency policies implemented so far by the various Member States for 2020 will not enable us to achieve the target of a 20% reduction in energy consumption; we will be lucky to manage 10%, which is a decidedly disappointing result. If energy consumption continues to increase, achieving the 20% renewable energy target may also be in jeopardy, since that target is calculated as a proportion of the EU’s final energy consumption. I am firmly in favour of setting a binding target for energy efficiency also, so as to ensure that Europe’s climate and energy policies are mutually reinforcing. Unfortunately, the facts suggest that counting on the goodwill of individual Member States is not going to work. The European Union must show the way with clear and effective policies and objectives. Let us stop investing in new facilities to produce more energy, and let us plough our money and our efforts into the cleanest energy in the world, energy that we can avoid using. Lastly, I call for the adoption of Amendment 2, which calls on the Commission to launch an initiative on the energy performance of existing buildings in 2011. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 18 December 1990, the UN adopted the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. This Convention is one of the UN’s nine main instruments on human rights. Unfortunately, 20 years later, none of the Member States of the European Union have signed or ratified that Convention. I believe that recognising the rights of third-country nationals who live and work legally in the European Union must be a priority for a Europe which faces new challenges in relation to integration, non-discrimination and protection of human rights. For this reason, I ask all Members to support Amendment 16 and to sign Written Declaration 96 – to which I am a signatory, together with Cornelia Ernst, Sylvie Guillaume and Franziska Keller – in order to petition Member States to ratify the UN Convention on migrant workers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the Belet report because it recognises and specifies the fundamental role played by public sector broadcasting in Europe. I see this as an important step for Parliament, which is clearly stating that public broadcasting needs to remain independent of political power. This report seems to have been written specially for Italy, where the RAI is now at an advanced stage of decomposition because it has been taken over completely by party politics, to the detriment of the cultural and informational depth of public broadcasting and, hence, of the entire country. Just look at what happened last week on the programme called ‘Vieni via con me’ (‘Come away with me’). The Minzolinis and Masis of broadcasting, professionals of public disinformation and their paymasters, are incompatible with the report that Parliament has adopted today. The European Union should take note and act accordingly. We want no more party politics on the RAI! Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of information about prescription-only medicinal products is a sensitive subject because it has an important effect on the protection of the right to health and welfare of all citizens. The European Commission sent us a proposal on the revision of the directive that risked opening a loophole in the legislation, which would have allowed pharmaceutical companies to exploit an unclear distinction between the definitions of information and advertising to promote their prescription-only medicinal products, to the detriment of the people. Of course, there is still much to do with regard to a suitable strategy for information on medicinal products, but fortunately this time the European Parliament has reacted as it always should. Parliament has taken a stand to protect citizens and defend a patient’s right to better information, and it has not given in to pressure from pharmaceutical companies. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Evans on the recast of the directive because I really regret the fact that in the compromise text, which was adopted due to strong pressure from industrial lobbies, all references to PVC and halogenated fire retardants have disappeared, even though all the studies carried out by the Commission have demonstrated since as far back as 2000 that the disposal of these substances poses serious risks for human health and the environment. Transferring the costs of industry to the environment and to citizens is an approach that we absolutely cannot support because, in addition to distorting the free market, it represents an unacceptable trade-off between peoples’ quality of life and the profits of business. I hope the next time the directive is updated, in three years’ time, that citizens' right to health and environmental protection will be placed right at the forefront. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have read the report carefully and I endorse it overall. However, I was left rather puzzled by various references to the future of coal in the European strategy, in particular in paragraph 52, in which the Commission is asked to draw up legal provisions to facilitate the building of coal-fired electric power plants. Several years ago in the United States, a political and citizens’ movement was started which has de facto 
led to a sort of moratorium on the building of coal-fired power plants. As well as CO2
 emissions, this decision is also based on the problem of dealing with the ash, which contains many toxic substances. Therefore, I absolutely do not support the defence of coal-fired power plants and I would note that so called ‘clean coal is, in many cases, more of a slogan than a reality. I have also heard several fellow Members fiercely defend nuclear energy, in terms of both costs and safety. Unfortunately, whoever says this shows that they do not know what they are talking about. Alternatives exist, they are renewable, they are genuine, and the European Union must plot its path for the coming decade in that direction. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciate the presence of Commissioner Hedegaard and the stance she has taken. I should like to thank you for your commitment to keeping Parliament continually updated on the developments for Cancún. The fight against climate change must be conducted on a global level and with everyone’s involvement, but the idea that our position must depend on that of other countries is irresponsible and does not do justice to the role that the EU has set itself, namely a leading role in guiding cultural revolutions at a global level, primarily the fight against climate change. We must set ourselves ever more ambitious targets and ensure that they are reached by the various Member States. I therefore thank the Commissioner for having reminded Italy, a few days ago, to maintain its financial promises of EUR 200 million to combat climate change. Unfortunately, I must inform the Commission that the Italian Government’s budget does not seem to provide for these funds at the moment. I would therefore ask the Commission to use all the powers available to it to make the Member States keep their promises, particularly when it is a matter of such a significant battle for the near future of the people of the world ...

 Madam President, the disaster of April 2010 is one of the most serious environmental disasters ever to have happened in the world. If the same thing happened within a closed sea such as the Mediterranean, the lives of tens of millions of European and non-European citizens would be threatened, with no way back. Yet in Italy – as Lega Ambiente
 protested with regard to an ill-conceived energy policy – we are seeing an extraordinary increase in research applications and permits granted by the ministry for identifying and extracting oil resources that would be sufficient to cover the Italian energy requirement for little more than one year. It is obvious that the sacrifice is not worth it. All this is compounded by concern over the fact that BP has announced an agreement with Libya for offshore extraction just under 500 km south of Sicily. I hope that the Commission undertakes, through this now imminent measure, to defend life in the Mediterranean against the attacks of multinationals and governments who are complicit and care little about our collective welfare.

 Madam President, I would like to report to Parliament that last Sunday, during the Pope’s visit to Palermo, the Italian Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union were suspended. Freedom of expression and of thought and the inviolability of private homes were trampled over. On this occasion, the Italian police insisted on the removal of a banner bearing a phrase from the Gospel: ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves’, while the same police force put up posters that were homophobic and against common-law couples. Inside the bookshop Altro quando
, the owner had put up a banner bearing the phrase ‘I love Milingo’. The police entered the private premises and seized the banner without any court warrant and using methods that were unedifying even by their own standards. It is paradoxical that in a lay and democratic State, as Italy is supposed to be, public freedom of expression is suppressed by the authorities in order not to offend the papal sensibilities, while Prime Minister Berlusconi is able to swear in public without this representing a problem for the Church. On this occasion, all the lay and religious institutions yet again rode roughshod over democracy in Italy, increasing the unbridgeable gap that has now emerged between institutions and the public. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Saturday, the Italian newspaper Il fatto quotidiano
 published a document signed by the Mafioso former mayor of Palermo, Vito Ciancimino, in which he wrote that Marcello Dell’Utri and Silvio Berlusconi were cut from the same cloth as him; that they belonged to the same mafia-dominated political system. This news comes to the attention of the magistracy as the truth emerges about the mafia massacres of 1992, which saw the deaths of judges Falcone and Borsellino, namely, the State negotiated with the mafia for the end of the ‘season of bombs’ and this favoured, as appears to be the case, the establishment of the Prime Minister’s party, Forza Italia
, which was indeed founded with the help of Dell’Utri, sentenced to seven years for mafia association and still a senator in the Italian Parliament. In the light of this and in the light of the recent murder of Mayor Angelo Vassallo by the Camorra, I reiterate the importance of the request made by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which, as a result of my continual pressure, has once again asked the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for a report on organised crime at European Union level. Europe cannot continue to turn the other cheek for fear of tackling a problem which is no longer local but globalised, and which right now closely affects the government of a Member State.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, under Rule 175 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, I call for this document to be referred back to committee. We have been waiting for this directive for a great many years but, as has been stressed in several other speeches, there are some items that need to be thoroughly amended in order to ensure adequate protection for animals. Adoption of this legislation will allow for experimentation for teaching purposes and the reuse of the same animal several times, even in procedures that cause it to suffer. It will not in any way encourage alternative methods that are considered scientifically valid. This is not a matter of adopting an extreme position, but rather of respecting Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which requires us to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals since they are sentient beings. We do not want to hold back research, but rather to encourage it along an ethically sustainable course. It is unacceptable to say that we can adopt this directive now and amend it in the years to come. We should take responsibility for making the necessary corrections to it now. This is not a political or ideological position; it is common sense, and common sense has no political hue. Sonia Alfano,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all unfortunately aware of the information situation in Italy. We are classified as a partly free country by Freedom House and occupy 71st place along with the islands of Tonga, ranking only just above East Timor. The ‘gagging law’ is only the latest development in an overall situation in which the country’s democratic defences are being greatly weakened, in particular, due to the lack of free information. As the OECD indicates in its most recent report, the disintegration of democracy and of the vested rights to information and free expression is unfortunately spreading throughout Europe. We need only think of France, with its government-appointed top public television service executive, or Hungary, Estonia and Romania, which, after taking tough legal action to limit freedom of expression, are making it impossible for information to play its essential democratic role as government watchdog. For this reason, I believe it is the Commission’s duty to make a strong, consistent commitment to defending media and information freedom, in line with the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. I therefore ask the Commission what action it intends to take to promote genuine media pluralism in the EU Member States and, in particular, when it will issue the communication on indicators for media pluralism, which was promised for 2010, together with the associated legislative proposal. I would not like to think that, as with the expulsion of the Roma in France, the Commission is tempted to give up its defence of freedom and democracy in Europe in order to cover up the work of Member State governments, which are increasingly concerned with hiding their wrongdoings from the press and the public. I hope that you, and also Commissioner Reding, will be able to reassure me on this point. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with you, Mr President, that it is the European Union’s duty to play a fundamental role in international issues and that we must speak with one, strong voice. It is most certainly our responsibility to intervene promptly and decisively each time human rights are oppressed, no matter where in the world that happens. I hope that the next six months of the Belgian Presidency will be distinguished by an unwavering commitment on those issues. To demonstrate that commitment, I ask for immediate attention to be paid to what is happening in certain Libyan prisons in the Sahara Desert: 250 Eritrean citizens, including women and children, have been shut up for days in inhumane conditions, in violation of all international regulations on human rights and asylum. Many of these citizens were denied political refugee status, even though they met all the necessary requirements. The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Frattini, actually accused the European Union of not even having published a press release. I think now is the time for the European Union to speak with one, strong voice. Right now, we must not turn our heads and look the other way, because 250 people are asking us to save them from death.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the right to petition is one of the main instruments available to European citizens for active participation in the political activities of the European Union. In approaching my mandate as an MEP in the spirit of service and respect for the citizen, and the priority that this must have in the decisions of the European Parliament, I have often taken an interest in the petitions submitted ... (The President asked the speaker to speak more slowly)
 I have often taken an interest in the petitions submitted and in their progress in the relevant committee. Unfortunately, despite the fact that Parliament’s Rules of Procedure stipulated, in Rule 5(3), that Members shall be entitled to inspect any files held by Parliament or a committee, I have discovered that the internal e-Petition 
database is only accessible to members of the relevant committee. I contacted the committee in question but, unfortunately, did not receive a response. I think that this discrimination, which reduces the importance of citizen’s petitions and undermines the work of the parliamentary committee, ought to be redressed immediately. We have little time, Mr President, so we try to say everything in one minute. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is undoubtedly a good piece of work and I should like to compliment the rapporteur on it. One of the first phrases of the explanatory statement struck a very positive chord with me, and I would like to quote it directly: ‘waste management policy must transform the EU into a recycling society’. However, I do detect some contradictions there. For example, the fact that separate collection is mandatory as long as it is the best option from both the environmental and economic standpoints. In other words, investments made by Member States in this area are not to be subject to discussion even if they are contrary to European guidelines. In this way, as has already been seen with the framework directive on waste, the European Union will provide little more than a suggestion. Plus, we forget – by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, which the European institutions all too often hide behind – that it is our duty to provide ambitious and incisive responses to the problem of waste. Let us fix targets for separate collection and stipulate their fulfilment. Let us use best practices, like the ‘zero waste’ policies enacted in some parts of the USA and make them binding for all Member States. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Cashman report because I believe it is the responsibility of this House and of the European institutions to abide by and uphold the commitments made to people who live in less developed countries, in particular, the countries of Africa. We cannot get to 2015 and realise that the eight goals that we set ourselves have not been achieved, because behind the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, behind these percentages – let us not forget this – there are billions of people who are suffering and do not have the opportunity to live in dignity. The European Union must set an example and lead the way as far as development assistance is concerned. Public debt cancellation, together with a greater commitment to ensuring that aid is put to good use, is one of the key points of this solidarity-based project, the achievement of which – we have to be aware – cannot be postponed without sacrificing more human lives.

According to a survey published by the Region of Sicily at the end of 2009, 75% of citizens believe that European funds have no positive impact whatsoever, or very little. If we then consider that, according to the Court of Auditors, 51% of resources earmarked to Sicily for the 2000-2006 programming period were not spent and that a good percentage of the funds utilised were blighted by irregularities, we can easily understand the almost total lack of public trust. I therefore fully support the report by my fellow Member. Only total transparency with the aim of ensuring that the public is made aware of the effective use of public resources can restore trust in the institutions. Anyone must be able to know to whom funds are allocated and, above all, to what end they are directed, while also being able to follow all stages from programming to the implementation of interventions. Enabling citizens to monitor European funds not only represents a fundamental manifestation of the democratic process but also constitutes a deterrent to any form of siphoning off of those public resources. I remind you that transparency does not merely mean making documents public: that is only the first step. Information must be accessible and easily intelligible; otherwise, its production will be merely a technical exercise that does not serve the purpose of any democratic control. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me a moment. (The speaker pretends to gag herself for a few seconds, to show that she cannot speak)
 This is what would happen in Italy if a law tabled and approved last week in the Italian Senate, the ‘draft law on wiretapping’, were also to be approved in the Chamber. This decree-law more or less bans journalists, bloggers – everyone – from publishing wiretaps. This is clearly unconstitutional, and is also against the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights which states, in Article 11, that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, as well as to receive and impart information. I would like to use a single example to focus the attention of the European institutions, because this really is an incredible form of censorship. I would like to use an example that is striking, evident and real. My father was a journalist killed by the Mafia and over the last seven years the true circumstances surrounding that Mafia murder have come to light through wiretaps. Through wiretaps, we were able to discover that he died because a fugitive was hiding in the area where we lived. I therefore call the attention of the European institutions to this matter.

 As regards the Ţicău report, I voted in favour of the common position on updating the directive on the energy performance of buildings, because the aim is that, from the end of 2020, all newly constructed buildings will have an energy balance equal to zero, an aim that the European institutions must make every effort to achieve. Europe has a shared commitment, and is firmly convinced that in the near future, it will not be necessary to produce more energy, but to make better use of that which is already produced. Energy saving and energy efficiency effectively represent a source of energy production. We do not need to wait ten years to move in this direction; instead, Member States need to commit as of now to achieving energy efficiency targets, using financial resources that, until today, have been dedicated to producing greater quantities of energy. I remind you especially of the iniquitous launch of the nuclear programme in Italy, which damaged and endangered the health of citizens and the environment. A huge quantity of public resources was wasted on this launch in order to produce, in less than twenty years, the same quantity of energy that we could do without if we were to invest the same resources in energy efficiency right now. Green investments for our children, not radioactive waste! I will now move on to the explanation of vote for the Rühle report. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 I voted in favour because I think it is important for Parliament to support the simplification and rationalisation of public procurement law. This will make work easier both for administrative bodies and for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which will find it easier to participate in tenders. I consider it essential to refer to the use of public procurement as a means of encouraging paths of sustainable development, by introducing environmental and social criteria within invitations to tender. I also think that it is the duty of this Parliament and of the European institutions to continue pressing for all-round transparency surrounding the use of public money, particularly with regard to public procurement, using all possible means and especially the Internet. Citizen control represents a crucial contribution for using public funds in a way that is genuinely in the collective interest and, as the Committee on Regional Development reminds us, for fighting the corruption that prevails within local and regional authorities.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of Parliament’s resolution on the new Digital Agenda for Europe because I believe that guaranteeing easy and affordable broadband access to the entire population is a strategic priority for the European Union. Extending Internet use means broadening and developing citizens’ freedom of expression, favouring their participation in democratic life and permitting the dissemination of knowledge and innovations. What I would like to highlight is that the spread of broadband in Europe would guarantee broader freedom of information. As noted by Eurostat, we must not forget that Europe also has two or possibly three speeds as regards the spread of the Internet. Italy, especially in some regions, as well as Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Portugal, are the least developed States in this sense. It is no accident that in the Freedom of the Press index for 2009 drawn up by Freedom House,
 Italy was listed among the partially free states, in last place in western Europe together with Turkey, and 72nd in the world together with Benin and India and preceded by Tonga. I also hope that thanks to these resolutions and the principles that have been mentioned, the Italian Government will decide to release the investment of EUR 800 million as soon as possible which was intended to break down the digital divide in Italy and which, according to a statement by Gianni Letta, the Deputy Secretary to the Italian Council of Ministers, is not a priority at the moment. I would like to emphasise that the quality of the service in Italy is inadequate for current needs and that for years consumer associations have been complaining that the access costs are among the least competitive in Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 16 people convicted of various types of crime have been elected to the Italian Parliament and, at the last European elections, Italy sent three MEPs who have been convicted by final judgment. There is no law in Europe prohibiting people who have been convicted by final judgment, or who are awaiting further legal proceedings, from standing for election; everything is left to the discretion of the Member States. Italian citizens have come up with the ‘Clean Parliament’ programme. We therefore call on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to amend the Act concerning the election of representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage to make it a condition, in order to stand for election to the European Parliament, not to have any criminal convictions, including those that have not become final. The Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in the last Parliament, Mr Leinen, undertook to do this, but everything was left to his successor, Mr Casini, who has already stated that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will not pursue it. We would point out that not only is this the responsibility of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but that Article 223 (formerly 190) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union actually stipulates that the European Parliament should implement a uniform electoral procedure throughout the European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, my political group. On 5 March, the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, signed an interpretative decree-law, also known as the ‘save list’ decree-law. In fact, this decree allows the rules of the game to be changed after the electoral campaign has started. On the website of the Quirinal Palace, Giorgio Napolitano himself states that, unlike the draft decree proposed to him by the government in a tense meeting on Thursday evening, in his view, the text subsequently drafted by the Ministry of the Interior and the Prime Minister did not present obvious defects of an unconstitutional nature. Article 87(5) of the Italian Constitution lays down that the President of the Italian Republic shall promulgate laws and issue decrees with the force of law, and regulations. The President of the Republic absolutely cannot participate in the drafting of procedures and of decree-laws. The President of the Republic’s predecessor, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, considers it to be an aberrant distortion of our democratic system. It is clear that the government is doing what the constitution prohibits. That decree, Mr President, has changed the rules of the game for an electoral competition that has already begun and allows those who have broken the law to stand, having been readmitted to the electoral competition. I wonder why Parliament is always ready to take a stand against countries that violate laws but does not acknowledge that there is a country among the 27 Member States that is violating laws.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Gas Natural
, a Spanish holding company, has submitted a project for on-shore regasification plants which would affect the Trieste area, and which has been approved by the Italian Ministry of the Environment. The Trieste regasification plant technical board has highlighted some important shortcomings. Following the informal meeting that took place between the European Commission, Italy and Slovenia on 26 January 2010, the Italian Permanent Representative to the European Union publicly speculated that the European Union had approved the project, whilst the official word from Slovenia is that the opposing sides have been called upon to reach an agreement. This accord will probably be difficult to achieve in practice, because of the atypical background to the regasification plant affair. In fact, it turns out that the bodies responsible for providing guarantees and for safety have failed to comply with their protection duties. Significant delays in drawing up external emergency plans and in communicating with public bodies and authorities responsible for managing emergencies have been highlighted, as has a failure to inform the public about the risks of serious accidents concerning codes of conduct, and the absence of an objective assessment of the domino effect caused by a possible accident in high-risk industrial plants. For these reasons, we believe this is yet another attempt to set up a high-risk plant, in the knowledge that there are absolutely no protection and safety measures in place. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw Parliament’s attention to the rules on company transfers contained in Directive 2001/23/EC. I am saying this because Eutelia S.p.A., an Italian company operating in the field of telecommunications and information technology, counts among its clients some very important businesses, but not just businesses: for example, it also provides services for the Bank of Italy, the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Italian Senate. Furthermore, it is involved with the Schengen project, so it manages some very confidential data. In May 2009, Eutelia all but divested itself of its IT branch, transferring it to its subsidiary, Agile, which basically has a fund of only EUR 96 000 to pay its 2 000 employees. Subsequently, in October 2009, 1 192 people received redundancy notices. These people are still employed, despite having received redundancy notices. Moreover, the ridiculous thing is that the rule that I referred to just now imposes specific requirements of entrepreneurship on those who acquire parts of undertakings … (The President cut off the speaker) Sonia Alfano,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the European Crime Prevention Network. This network was set up in 2001 by Council Decision 2001/427/JHA. Its objectives were to facilitate cooperation and exchanges of information and experiences at national and European level; to collect and analyse relevant information aimed in particular at the exchange of best practices; to organise conferences, seminars, meetings and initiatives with the objective of facilitating the exchange of experiences and best practices; and to provide its expertise to the Council and the Commission concerning crime prevention. The Decision envisaged that the structure would be based on contact points designated by the Commission and the Member States; these contact points were to include at least one representative from the national authorities, while the other designated contact points could be researchers or university academics specialising in this field. Member States were, in any case, required to involve researchers, university academics, NGOs and civil society. Even Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction were involved in the work as expert bodies. In 2005, the network underwent its first internal structural reform. This foresaw the permanent establishment of two commissions – one for the work programme and one for research – while the running of the website was transferred from the European Commission to the United Kingdom, which still keeps it updated. In 2007, there was another review, which acknowledged the particular need to strengthen the secretariat and highlighted the need to confront the problem of resources for the permanent commissions and the national representatives. In March 2009, an external evaluation was published concerning the functioning of the network. This focused on the importance of the objectives that brought the network into being but, at the same time, regrettably highlighted the organisational failure that had impeded the achievement of the important objectives that we were speaking of earlier. The problems thus brought to light, which have led to the virtual collapse of the network, included the lack of suitable resources, an ineffective secretariat, lack of commitment on the part of the national representatives and a very poor work programme. The evaluation also considered the possibility of disbanding the network. In consequence, the network appointed a working group to examine the recommendations made in March 2009 and took the view that certain amendments needed to be made to the Act that created the network. In particular, it was suggested that there should be an external secretariat financed with funds from Community programmes. Although some Member States had revived the idea of disbanding the network, others suggested that it should be reformed. The Swedish Presidency of the European Council agreed with this proposal, to the extent of making it a priority in its own six-month term of office. At this point, I must stress how embarrassed I am to see these empty seats, given that these proposals were made by the Swedish Presidency itself. The proposal envisages that the network should be composed of a secretariat, of contact points designated by each Member State and of a board of directors. This board of directors should be made up of national representatives appointed by Member States and would be presided over by a chairman in charge of an executive committee. I think there is also some confusion in this respect between contact points and national representatives. Civil society, the academic world, the world of experience and hence, of experts, are all being completely left out of the network. This is a very serious matter. The structural links between the network and the other Community institutions and bodies that are concerned with crime and its prevention have been completely cut off. The Decision does not envisage any form of cooperation with the European Parliament and the requirement for knowledge of languages has been omitted, despite having been requested previously. Speaking as rapporteur, I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and is incapable of tackling crime prevention for several reasons. First, it has been unable to fulfil the objectives for which it was created; second, there has been no cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Member States, and I believe that this must be regarded as a sort of sabotage of the network itself. Crime prevention cannot be reduced to the exchange of best practices. Unfortunately, we have witnessed what is almost a type of tourism on the part of various officials who have visited various countries and have often not even managed to speak to one another because there were no interpreters. The failure to involve civil society and NGOs, or to develop materials on prevention such as books for schools, makes this network completely ineffective. To make the network function, I think we should strengthen its powers, and also incorporate the fight against crime and the prevention of organised crime. I therefore suggest that we reject this proposal, which could have been accepted only if the Council had presented a genuinely ambitious proposal. Unfortunately, this has not happened.

On the contrary, we should like to be involved, given that the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force within a few days, and I consider that Parliament’s role as colegislator is of fundamental importance. I had personally asked the Council formally to present a much more ambitious proposal on the European Crime Prevention Network and to do so immediately after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This proposal was not presented. Therefore, it proved truly necessary to reject the proposal, and I believe that Parliament has the right to operate on the basis of full codecision, especially regarding such important issues as this. I thank Mr Nicholson for what he said concerning the roles of victims and perpetrators, roles that are too often reversed. In the few months that I have been in Parliament, I have noted that Parliament and the European Union have accorded an extraordinary degree of importance to the fight against terrorism, while sadly there is a lack of will to address not only the fight against crime, but the organised crime that is at the root of it. It is impossible to imagine combating or preventing crime without considering the possibility of a more comprehensive operation to repress and prevent organised crime and the Mafia – as Mr De Magistris has stated, quoting the remarkable words of Judge Falcone, who was murdered by the Mafia. This said, I should like to make a small digression as someone who unfortunately has had first-hand experience of these matters. All too often, there is not only confusion between victim and perpetrator, but there are governments – and sadly the Italian Government has not paid much attention to this matter – which put victims of the same type of crime on a different footing from each other. Victims of terrorism are treated in one way, and victims of the Mafia in another. In my view, these differences and forms of discrimination cannot continue to exist, because such differences have absolutely no place in a Europe that aims to base its policy on innovation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to address the Commissioner, who maintained that it is not the job of this Parliament to resolve certain issues. I would point out, however, that it is the job of this Parliament to ensure that the Treaty and the Member States’ constitutions are respected. A few months ago, the Italian Minister for Justice declared that he had arranged for the imminent closure of some parts of YouTube and the Internet. I would point out that only in China do such things happen. Article 21 of the Italian Constitution decrees that the press may not be subject to authorisation or censorship. As other Members have already confirmed, Italy is the only country in which the Head of Government has a monopoly on public, and now also private, television channels and in which, unfortunately, a law is being passed that will, in fact, prevent journalists from publishing even judicial reports. This is because, were they to be published, Italians would probably learn about Mr Berlusconi’s part in the 1992 massacres, Mafia massacres in which Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino died. (The President called for order)
 Mr President, I would ask you to ensure that we have order in this House, since we are not at a market. Sonia Alfano,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you Mr Barrot and Mr Billström. Back on 31 August, I tabled a priority question to the Commission. It is true that the number of migrants reaching Italian and Libyan shores has fallen, but this is because the number of dead which the Mediterranean Sea continues to receive has risen. Alas, the Mediterranean has now become a mass grave and the Berlusconi Government, to wit, the Italian Government, has signed an agreement with Libya which unfortunately allows Italy to refuse entry not only to migrants, but also refugees from countries where there is persecution or civil war, such as Somalia and Eritrea, and denies these poor people the right to seek asylum, thereby breaching every international rule and the Geneva Convention in particular. I would remind you that non-refoulement is a principle which knows no geographical boundaries and which cannot be haggled over or negotiated under any circumstances. We do not want to continue thinking that ultimately, this Italy-Libya agreement boils down to economic interests worth around EUR 5 000 billion. I demand that the Commission does not – if this is its intention – conclude an EU-Libya agreement similar to the Italian one, as we have seen the results of that despicable agreement. I repeat, alas this agreement forces these people to undergo torture, because this is what we are dealing with: the detention centres to which they are taken in Libya are torture, according to press reports and also photographs, for example, photographs which show many of these immigrants in Ganfuda prison, 10 kilometres from Benghazi. This is torture, which I do not believe is accounted for in any friendship or institutional agreements. As highlighted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the non-refoulement principle prevents people being returned to territories where their lives could be considered to be in danger or their freedom could be threatened. Sending these people back to Libya which, I would again remind you, has neither signed nor ratified the Geneva Convention, seems truly unbelievable. Moreover, to add insult to injury, illegal immigration is a criminal offence in Italy so, for example, after the dramatic landing at the end of August in which many Somalis lost their lives, those few, I think four or five Somalis who managed to reach their destination have, among other things, been accused of immigration and are therefore now being prosecuted under Italian law. I call on the Commission now to take real action, to assess whether the Italy-Libya agreement complies with international law and finally bring about a decisive change of course by not supporting the Italian Government’s nefarious policy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate those who actively contributed to the adoption of the report on the Statute for a European cooperative society. I would like to emphasise the important role of the cooperative experience in Italy and Europe and of its impact on the territory, in particular, during the period of crisis we are currently going through. However, I must regretfully note that the European cooperative society (SCE) is not yet a success, given its scarce use: in 2010, only 17 SCEs were registered. This should make us question the applicability of the legal framework. I believe that today, more than ever, simplification is needed to enable small organisations to access information on national provisions for implementing regulations and directives. Furthermore, I think we need to remember the commitments undertaken by the Commission, in particular, to include cooperatives among the financial instruments of the European Investment Fund and to make explicit reference to more favourable conditions for cooperatives, such as easier access to loans and tax concessions. The Italian experience has shown that if cooperatives are supported by adequate instruments and concessions, they produce excellent results in terms of employment and society. Vincenzo Iovine  (ALDE

Mr President, I was pleased to play a part in approval of the scheme for distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union. At a time like this, when the number of deprived people in Europe has risen as a result also of the economic crisis, I believe that an important signal like today’s can contribute to greater cohesion in the European Union. This reminds me of the example of a Neapolitan saint. He was a doctor called Giuseppe Moscati. When he received patients in his surgery, he used to put his hat on the desk with the sides turned up, and a notice placed on it reading ‘Those who have please give, and those who don’t please take’.Andrea Zanoni,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let us stop ‘finning’! We must put a stop to indiscriminate capture of sharks in order to remove their precious and much sought-after fins before throwing the huge shark bodies back into the sea. There must be an end to exemptions for special permits. This is what Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has asked for in its opinion, on which I acted as rapporteur, which despite some opposition from the Committee on Fisheries, will be approved in full by this House tomorrow. The European Union, in line with the view of the scientific world, decided to outlaw finning in 2003, but the exemptions allowed by the current legislation make it impossible to combat a phenomenon that poses a serious threat to the survival of this particularly vulnerable species. There is no other way to go: only by making it mandatory for fins to be landed still naturally attached to the body can a simple and effective control of the ban on on-board finning be achieved. Encouraging conservation of shark stocks will bring about genuinely sustainable fishing. I therefore call on Parliament to support the proposal. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 2013 will rightly be the Year of European Citizens. This is an important initiative because recalling and enhancing awareness, in particular among young people, of the rights and achievements attached to European citizenship should be treated as an absolute priority. Today, thanks to the process of European integration, EU citizens may live, work, study and travel freely within the territory of the Member States, use the health services, enjoy rights and protection as passengers and consumers, and vote and stand as candidates in elections to the European Parliament and in municipal elections in their Member State of residence. These are important achievements, which bring with them not just a strong symbolic connotation that strengthens and promotes the sense of belonging to Europe, but also undoubted advantages and practical opportunities. However, according to a Eurobarometer report, and as I can confirm on a daily basis in my work as an MEP, there is often a lack of awareness of these rights, and of the values and principles that inspire them. It is therefore essential to make every effort, particularly in the schools but also elsewhere, to raise awareness of and provide information on the great advantages of our dual citizenship, the European aspect of which enhances and strengthens the national aspect.

Madam President, protection of passenger rights is an increasingly important issue, especially at times of crisis such as the present, when transport cost cutting and sudden airline bankruptcy in the sector can cause serious disruption to passengers. All too often we read in the newspapers of cancelled flights and hundreds of passengers left to fend for themselves, sometimes for days on end; not to mention rail delays and cancellations, leaving thousands of workers, students and whole families stranded, often without information on alternative modes of transport to bring them home or to work. Passengers must be guaranteed more price transparency and must be protected against unfair commercial practices, such as the addition of non-optional operational costs and excessive restrictions on hand luggage. Efforts must be made to provide multilingual information points to deal with rerouting and cancellation of flights and trains, in order to provide the best protection possible for European citizens. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, reforming the common fisheries policy is a necessary decision that cannot be put off any longer. We fish too much in Europe, and we often fish badly. If we want to safeguard marine biological resources, conserve the marine ecosystem and ensure the survival of the fisheries sector, we have to give overexploited fish stocks time to recover. However, the view that prevailed in this Chamber today by only a few votes was the blinkered view of those who want to maintain the status quo and continue to condemn our seas and the whole fisheries sector to certain death. That is why I voted against the report on the reform of the common fisheries policy. We need a well-thought-out reform that allows for the sustainable exploitation of marine resources and not a watered-down text that offers no future prospects. We need multiannual management plans and a precise timetable, as well as a network of protected areas. I welcome sanctions against those Member States that do not abide by the rules, carry out inadequate controls, exceed their quotas and do not provide reliable data. Greater protection for the fish in our seas means more jobs for European fishermen, but there are some people in this Chamber who have not yet understood that. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, the current global economic and environmental crisis requires us to make choices to save resources. With the Energy Efficiency Directive adopted today, we can achieve important goals, such as tackling the problem of climate change and the scarcity of fossil fuels, including coal and oil; cutting the annual cost of buying fuel, which amounts to EUR 400 billion, by making a potential saving of EUR 50 billion per year; reducing Europe’s dependency on Russia and OPEC countries, from which we import gas and oil; reducing air pollution, which, in some regions of Europe, currently poses an unfortunately unresolved threat to the health of millions of European citizens; creating new jobs and benefits for small and medium-sized enterprises, including installers and the building sector, which is currently going through a very serious crisis. I therefore welcome the rules introduced for the renovation of public buildings and for four-yearly energy audits, which are compulsory for all large enterprises. This is one of the many steps Europe needs to take. However, we need to do more: we must set ourselves more ambitious targets and take measures that are more binding on all Member States. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today is a very important day for the health of European citizens. Indeed, this is, without doubt, one of the most important reforms of the entire parliamentary term when one considers the beneficial impact it will have on the health of European citizens. From today, the EU has stricter regulations and is establishing new upper limits on the sulphur content of marine fuels, which contain air pollutants that are estimated to cause as many as 50 000 premature deaths in Europe. For Northern European countries – the so-called Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) – a maximum sulphur content in fuels of below 0.1% comes into force from 2015 while, for all other countries, the limit will be 0.5% from 2020. We should no doubt have aimed higher; these new limits should have applied across the whole of the European Union. What price life, though? That is what thousands of European citizens are wondering in cities with major ports like that of my beautiful mistreated Venice, whose inhabitants and whose works of art are constantly being poisoned by smoke from the stacks of great ships. Well, thanks to Europe, that smoke will now be a little less black. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on the welfare of animals because it introduces important concepts for a better future for animals and European citizens. Issues including a new directive to protect dogs and cats, the violation of the directives on zoos and laying hens by many Member States, and maintaining the March 2013 deadline for cosmetics tested on animals must be addressed urgently and as a matter of priority. We also need to provide for mandatory labelling for meat from animals barbarically slaughtered without being stunned. We must adopt an EU law on animal welfare and set up a body that monitors whether the Member States enforce the rules on the industry. We can and we must, however, do much more for animal welfare. Modern, civilised Europe can no longer tolerate barbaric, uncivilised and backwards practices such as vivisection, hunting or bullfighting. Let us renounce these absurd activities right now, for a Europe that is more respectful of animals and more respectful of the views of its citizens, who are often much more far-sighted, caring and sensitive than national and EU authorities.

 In the resolution on the establishment of an EU legal framework for the protection of pets and stray animals, it is reiterated that the European Union is based on sharing different principles and values. Millions of European citizens attach a special sentimental value to animals and in particular to pets, such as dogs and cats. There are more than 100 million pets in Europe, but despite the large number, the EU still does not have an EU framework law to protect our pets and stray animals. With today’s vote, Parliament is giving a voice to thousands of European citizens and is urging the EU to establish a framework law to protect animals and in particular to lay down: rules for the identification and registration of animals; stray animal management strategies, including vaccination and sterilisation programmes; measures to promote responsible ownership; the prohibition of unlicensed kennels and shelters; the prohibition of killing of stray animals without medical indication; information and educational programmes in schools on animal welfare; and severe sanctions to be imposed on any Member State which fails to comply with the rules.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is life; water is a precious public asset that we have a duty and an interest in conserving and managing sustainably in order to safeguard ecosystems and the very survival of the human race. This important report takes stock of the implementation status of EU water legislation ahead of the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’, which the Commission has announced for this autumn. Much has been done in the 12 years since the Water Framework Directive entered into force, but there is still a huge amount left to do, especially in many southern European countries such as Italy, which is to appear before the Court of Justice because of delays in implementing the directive. We have to ensure sufficient availability of good-quality water, bearing in mind that water resources in Europe are distributed unevenly, and consequently we must mainstream this issue in all European policy areas. It is unacceptable that as much as 70% of the water supplied to our communities may be lost through leakage due to the poor state of repair of our water systems. We must reach the target of a green economy and equip ourselves with locally developed water plans that strictly combat waste and encourage water saving, reuse and recycling, whether for irrigation or for domestic use, and across all sectors of the economy. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the amendments to the regulation on the recovery of bluefin tuna stocks because, as acknowledged by the international scientific community, this is a species at risk of extinction. The figures speak for themselves: since 2009, there has been a sharp decrease in catches in all our seas. We therefore need to act swiftly in order to prevent the stock from disappearing completely. A telling example of the seriousness of the situation is the reduction in the average size of tuna fish, a phenomenon which is strikingly obvious in the Adriatic Sea, my region. We must urgently set up closed areas and sanctuaries for bluefin tuna where fishing is banned to allow stocks to recover. We need to step up controls, since illegal fishing in all European seas is still too widespread and too frequent. The envisaged measures, such as the seizure of illegal vessels and gear, must go hand in hand with effective, efficient controls, carried out by an appropriate number of employees. Lastly, it is essential to raise the minimum weight of tuna fish that may be caught, currently just 30 kilograms, and ban fishing during the spawning season. In order to save bluefin tuna we can, and must, do more. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Gerbrandy on an excellent report. The transition to a resource-efficient economy is inevitable and necessary. In 2050, the global population will reach 9 billion people and each of them will strive for a better life. As indicated by the Commission, at the current rate of resource use, in 2050, the equivalent of two Earths will be needed to sustain the world’s population. The case for ensuring each and every European policy is resource-efficient is therefore also economic. Member States must remove all obstacles to the market in waste recycling and reuse and provide economic incentives to promote innovative technologies for the collection and separation of waste. It is right to get to zero waste by banning landfill and phasing out the incineration of recyclables. We have to agree on indicators for resource use in economic activity, in other words, our footprint on the planet, our water footprint, our materials footprint and our carbon footprint. These indicators have to be used to promote legislative initiatives for sustainable development and less use of resources. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regional airports are important for improving Europe’s links and allowing its citizens to move around inside the Union, but these structures must be built and operated according to the European Union’s own environmental standards. We cannot allow air traffic, and with it regional airports, to further harm the European environment, our air quality and the well-being of our region. In northern Italy, for example – I am thinking of the cities of Treviso and Verona – the airport structures have been expanded in recent years without due consideration for the contexts in which these airports operate on a daily basis. More air connections in Europe are fine, but not at the cost of Europe’s environment, air and land. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against climate change is necessary for the survival of the planet. It is absolutely critical that Europe and all stakeholders strive to limit the increase in average temperatures to 2 °C. This is the only way that we can lower the risk of natural disasters, and consequent migration and population displacement. It is acknowledged at international level that it is certainly the poor who suffer the most. Well, 70% of the world’s poorest are women. In the developing world, it is women who play a crucial role in the abstraction and practical management of water, not just in the home but also in farming, and it is women who today have to work more owing to droughts and water shortages resulting precisely from climate change. This is why gender perspectives must be mainstreamed into all stages of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiation process, in order to effectively improve the welfare of women around the world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to what might soon be happening in one of Italy’s finest forests, the Cansiglio, located between the Veneto and Friuli regions. This is an area of great natural importance, part of the Natura 2000 network. It is here in this forest, once protected by the Most Serene Republic of Venice, that for the first time – after a ban that has lasted for centuries – hundreds of deer will be hunted, under proposals from the provinces of Treviso and Belluno and the Veneto and Friuli regional administrations. Pregnant does, on the point of delivery, will also be brutally killed, as set out in the culling plans. Under the pretext of overpopulation, disputed by the Worldwide Fund for Nature and many other associations, the Italian authorities are giving the green light to these killings. The EU must more effectively ensure compliance with directives protecting biodiversity, providing appropriate sanctions for any local administrations that violate them. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 215 million children worldwide used as child labour, 152 million child workers under the age of 15, 115 million children involved in dangerous activities – these are shocking figures that we can no longer tolerate. I voted in favour of the resolution on child labour in the cocoa sector, with absolute conviction, because the European Union has to play a fundamental role in stopping this form of modern slavery. The Commission must do its utmost to include effective provisions that will guarantee dignified employment and prevent forced child labour in all trade agreements with cocoa producing countries such as Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. We need a traceability mechanism to identify goods produced using child labour. The European Union has always defended the rights of the world’s most vulnerable people, and children working in the harvesting of cocoa beans deserve our full attention. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, one of the most important issues highlighted by the European Union Growth Survey 2012 is the serious need for new and stronger social and employment policies, especially for young people. A country with a high level of youth unemployment is a country destined to perish. In my country, Italy, the statistics are frightening. According to Eurostat data for November 2011, the youth unemployment rate is 30.1%. Young people who are often highly qualified with plenty of energy and motivation are allowed to wither away by a system where gerontocracy has become the norm. The Commission’s commitment in allocating EUR 82 billion from unused Structural Funds to stimulate growth and youth unemployment is a good step that needs to be made in the right direction. Investing in young people means investing in the future. Guaranteeing work for young Europeans means guaranteeing a future for us all. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Madam President, I should like to draw the attention of the Chamber and of European citizens to what has been going on for months in Ukraine. Since it was decided to hold the Euro 2012 football championship in Poland and Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities have, in order to stage a quick clean-up of their cities, unleashed a savage cull of stray dogs. These poor animals, including mothers and puppies, are being killed in their thousands by poisoning, clubbing and shooting, while even mobile crematory ovens are being used for this purpose. This terrible news has been broadcast around the world. On the Internet, one can see images of these acts of horrifying violence, which have been denounced and documented by reporters and local animal-protection societies. In view of the special relations that we have with this country, I call upon the European institutions to make urgent representations to the Ukrainian authorities to stop this uncivilised and barbaric massacre.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is clear from the numerous waste-related petitions received by Parliament from citizens: EU management of waste in Europe is not going well. There are too many citizens who even now, in 2012, are paying for the consequences of poor waste management in terms of their daily lives and their health, incinerators and landfills being cases in point. All the same, virtuous examples of ecologically sustainable waste management in the EU do exist. We must therefore do all we can to reach a point of total recycling, where waste actually becomes a genuine resource. This is already a reality today. There are treatment plants that recycle nearly 100% of urban waste, as in the case of the Vedelago waste centre in the province of Treviso, whose technology is exported throughout Europe. Nevertheless, we need more controls, prevention and, above all, responsible choices. We should recycle, recover and reduce waste and say ‘no’ to huge incinerators and landfills that are often the cause of air and aquifer pollution. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the resolution on the forthcoming international United Nations conference in Durban because I think that the climate change challenges posed by global warming require, more than ever, extremely strong commitment from Europe. Climate upheaval due to overheating is shown by irrefutable scientific proof and the consequent environmental, human and economic damage is now quite clear to everyone. This situation requires us to take fast, courageous decisions. Europe must retain a leading role in the fight against global overheating, committing to provide aid to other countries in terms of technology and resources. These financial resources must also be recovered through an international ‘Tobin tax’ on financial transactions. The Durban conference must lead to a legally binding international agreement with tangible outcomes for the fight against global warming. Above all, it must produce a clear calendar with deadlines and precise commitments for all countries of the world. All countries must finally put collective interests above their own individual interests because either we make an effort, or we will all pay a very hefty price. These are tough, extremely important and essential decisions, because there is no plan B any more. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, protecting bees means protecting all pollinating insects, agriculture, the environment and the ecosystem. I have abstained from voting on the resolution of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development because it is incomplete and not effective enough. The use of neonicotinoid pesticides to treat maize seeds in agriculture has led to the destruction of millions of bees. In Italy, we have experienced losses of between 30% and 70% of hives, causing serious damage to beekeepers, bees and the environment. In the two years that Italy has prohibited the use of these pesticides, two important results have come about: the bee population has recovered, and it has been demonstrated that maize production has not diminished without the use of pesticides. Today’s resolution has been a missed opportunity to call for the banishment across Europe of neonicotinoid pesticides. Europe should undertake to defend this most important natural asset on a wider scale and with greater conviction. Albert Einstein said, ‘If all the bees died, man would have four years to live’.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the continent of Europe is extremely rich in fresh water but risks becoming poor in drinking water. This is a paradox caused by the rising number of cases of water table pollution. In my region of Veneto, in Italy, for example, authorisation has been given over the last 50 years for quarrying below the water table and landfill sites that have resulted in serious pollution of the water table, groundwater and wells for drinking water. In May of this year, the Veneto Regional Environmental Protection Agency found mercury poisoning in over 100 wells located in various municipalities in the province of Treviso. Therefore, we need to take prompt action to immediately unlock the crucial Soil Directive, which was adopted at first reading by the European Parliament in 2007 but has remained blocked by the Council. The directive makes it mandatory to register and reclaim contaminated sites, which would solve the problem of water table pollution. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, the hunting season opens in many European countries in September, and people begin to shoot millions of wild animals in the name of an anachronistic activity which can no longer be justified. Despite the protection laid down by European laws, in certain countries, such as Italy, some local authorities allow exceptional hunting, namely the hunting of protected birds such as chaffinches or meadow pipits, just to pander to the hunters’ lobby and secure their votes. The Veneto and Lombardy regions have recently approved exceptional hunting again, demonstrating contempt and indifference, not least towards the European Court of Justice and its very recent judgments on this subject. Europe needs stricter rules. In order to protect wild animals we have to put an end to this barbarian medieval practice. We need to put an immediate stop to these illegal rules in these regions.

Madam President, there are two aspects to the measure that we have adopted, one geopolitical and the other environmental. Geopolitically the introduction of shale gas extraction could have a positive effect for Europe, since it might reduce our dependence on Iranian and Russian resources, but there are strong environmental concerns. This apparently harmless gas may have a severe impact on the environment, on nature and on the coming generations. The resolution we have adopted therefore takes a cautious approach and introduces a moratorium. However, we will have to return to the question to assess the environmental effects.

 Madam President, with this report Parliament is recognising how quickly the consumer credit market is changing. The financial crisis is also a credit crisis and the massive reduction in loans granted to families affects businesses and the whole economy. If the Commission could intervene to increase access to cross-border credit, which is currently too low, accounting for only 2 % of total credit in the EU, many Europeans who are currently unable to obtain loans in their own countries because of the economic problems of those countries could obtain them in other Member States, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of the single market for which the European institutions are fighting so hard to overcome national boundaries.

 Madam President, I am expressing my opinion and my vote in favour of the matter under discussion because the burgeoning of means of payment and the widespread use of ‘e-money’ demand rules that reflect the times and that reconcile the drive towards greater openness to the internal market with the need for transparency. There are some positive aspects to this, which have an impact on the fight against laundering money from unlawful activities and on tax evasion, which is an unfortunate feature of many Member States. However, we need to look at this in greater detail. I think it is essential that we understand the potential problems that multilateral interchange fees could cause as regards competitiveness, with costs and surcharges that discourage greater use of e-money, and some hidden interchange fees that could do the opposite of making for an open, competitive and transparent market system.

There is plenty to do, but it was the positive aspects of this report that made me vote for it. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of the text adopted today, which stems from the Commission Communication of 2011 on Social Business Initiative. The Europe 2020 strategy lies ahead, and with it we will need to provide answers to the ever-increasing need for social services, for example in the health and nursing sectors, and to estimate the demographic trend we have to deal with. However, this must be accompanied by a high degree of innovation and experimentation, the success or failure of which is a matter for the European institutions to evaluate within a set timescale, so we can see whether this initial approach could bring about improvements and can continue to develop this type of enterprise effectively in the longer term. We need to bear in mind that the nature of this type of business is very specific, having to reconcile economic growth with solidarity. For this reason I voted in favour, so that this constructive approach can be a basic pillar of a new society that reclaims the meaning and value of a job where humans are central to society in a new, integrated kind of humanism.

 As rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I actively assisted in drafting the macro-regional strategy for the Mediterranean. I see it as a territorial cooperation tool that will achieve greater synergy between the various intervention instruments through multi-level governance. In this respect, the strategy for the Mediterranean may hinge on the need to develop an integrated maritime transport system covering the whole Mediterranean basin and the development of renewable energy. A fundamental issue that I have worked for in this dossier is to address the island question at a European level and to ask the EU institutions to implement Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union by adopting an ad hoc
 strategy that takes account of the handicaps faced by islands. Another feature of the dossier is the provision that the Commission, in collaboration with the forthcoming Cypriot Presidency of the EU, will adopt a strategic plan for islands that creates the conditions for economic growth in these territories while ensuring their full territorial continuity. A particularly significant point is the call for the Commission to adopt measures, such as increasing the threshold for de minimis
 aid for islands in the transport, agriculture and fishery sectors, which will make the islands equally competitive with the mainland territories. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Mr President, I, together with the Italian Italia dei Valori
 delegation, have backed the introduction of the Tobin tax, a financial speculation tax, since 2010. Today, Parliament voted in favour of introducing this tax, which we believe to be an essential tool to ensure that the financial sector assumes its responsibilities and is steered back towards the real economy. As far as we are concerned, the introduction of a European financial transaction tax (FTT) reasserts the supremacy of democratic politics over the serious discrepancies in the functioning of the financial markets, which caused the economic crisis we are experiencing today. The FTT does away with the exemption from tax on financial transactions and makes financial speculators responsible in the same way as ordinary citizens, who have to pay taxes even on bread and petrol on a daily basis. With expected revenues of over EUR 50 billion a year, the European Parliament is today sending a signal that it is taking responsibility, in order to create more solidarity in the world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I voted in favour of the own-initiative report on regional airports, and I am sure it will serve as a basis for their further regulation. This report shows the importance that the European Parliament attributes to these airports in the context of air transport and the important role that they play as a vehicle for territorial, economic and social cohesion within the European Union. For the first time, the definition of a regional airport has been provided and an attempt has been made to limit the area of reference by sub-dividing regional airports into major and minor airports, also in relation to passenger throughput and the links provided by such airports. It is certainly to be hoped that the Commission will then follow up with more stringent specifications for their definition. A special passage concerns recognition of the need to guarantee public service obligations for remote regions, islands and the outermost regions, as we are well aware of their handicap in terms of participation in the single market. Finally, I believe that the definition establishing and specifying the negative view of the irrational proliferation of further regional airports is useful. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal to amend the provisions on risk-sharing instruments is extremely timely for those Member States at risk of suffering great difficulties as a result of the current financial instability. Its arrival during this period of serious economic crisis is perfect. Hence, in this amendment to the regulation on risk-sharing instruments, countries such as Ireland, Portugal, Hungary, Romania, Lithuania and above all Greece will find an alternative to the threat of losing funds already assigned and therefore the chance to carry on with programmes cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund that are proving difficult to implement in these Member States. This will result in the projects being carried out and jobs being retained across the parts of the European Union most affected by the economic crisis, without eating into the EU’s budget in any way but instead making a major contribution to growth in Europe.

 I voted in favour of Mr Taylor’s own-initiative report because it calls on the Commission to intervene both to enforce existing legislation and to promote and simplify the use of the instruments that protect air passenger rights. This report emphasises the legal certainty of passengers’ rights, their right to information, and the independence and operational transparency of the independent enforcement bodies that can impose penalties for infringements and resolve disputes between passengers and the industry. All too often, passengers find that they are the victims of the abusive practices of air carriers, which take advantage of passengers’ lack of information about their own rights in order to delay or cancel flights arbitrarily without accepting the liability that they should accept by law. I hope, therefore, that this report can provide useful suggestions for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, which is expected to take place next year.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a picture of Rossella Urru, the young Sardinian woman kidnapped in Algeria on 23 October along with two Spanish colleagues during a cooperation mission to help the poorest inhabitants of the Maghreb. Rossella is a young woman who has dedicated her life to a noble occupation, namely helping people in need. The young woman’s family, the Italian nation, and all of us eagerly await her release and the release of all European citizens who are hostages or have been abducted. Rossella is a young European citizen, a standard-bearer of our values, and that is why she must return home. That is why I am calling for the foreign service and our High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, to redouble their diplomatic efforts to ensure that Rossella can regain her freedom and return home.

 Mr President, the milk and milk products sector has been undergoing a terrible crisis for some years now, but there are internal imbalances that this report and its amendment – which I supported from the start – will determine to a lesser extent, by influencing how it works and putting an end to these internal imbalances, or at least remedying them in part together with other instruments. This measure has been produced by the working group set up by Mr Cioloş, which produced some instruments for restoring balance to the added value for all operators in the supply chain. In specific terms, the terms and conditions of contracts will have determined characteristics of form, requirements and duration, which will mainly be useful to producers. One important element will concern raw milk processed in less favoured areas (LFAs), mountainous areas, intermediate areas and islands, where any transfer of milk from areas which are not LFAs must be authorised in advance.

 Madam President, I voted for the report by Mr Fleckenstein because I am fully convinced that an Agency as important as the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) must have a regulation that specifies clear, precise duties, and highlights the effective division of tasks between EMSA, the European Commission and the Member States. All too often we are witness to accidents that pollute our seas, which are under constant threat also from the rise in the transport of dangerous goods and materials by sea, often in maritime areas protected by special rules due to their naturalistic importance, such as the Bocche di Bonifacio. In this regard, I particularly appreciated the rapporteur’s focus on development of the CleanSeaNet service and the SaveSeaNet network. The text was very balanced despite being multi-faceted, recognising the need to define EMSA’s tasks also by taking on more staff, without putting too much pressure on the budget, and underlining the importance of innovative tools such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme (GMES), while also launching a positive message on support in the sector for gender equality policies.

 Madam President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Grosch on a Single European Transport Area, and would like to thank him for his work. I would particularly like to thank him for the welcome references to the new guidelines on the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), which will animate the future legal debate, and for recognising the value of innovative instruments such as Galileo, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and Global Monitoring for Environment and Safety (GMES.) However, I am sorry that some aspects of fundamental importance in creation of a real Single European Transport Area were not adequately explored. More specifically, the insular nature of many European countries has not been investigated in sufficient detail, particularly with regard to the regulations that apply to them in terms of their obligations to provide public transport, which are currently muddled and difficult to describe as far as the various modes of transport are concerned. Lastly, I found the text did not sufficiently cover the issue of transporting hazardous goods, which needs to be properly dealt with and regulated, both in order to avoid terrible accidents, and in order to manage accidents once they have happened, including in terms of the liability of the entities involved, institutions or otherwise.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was among those who signed the alternative resolution on the health of honeybees, because the report put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) completely rejected the recommendations indicated in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) opinion, for which I was a shadow rapporteur. The plague inflicted upon bees is a problem which is becoming more and more serious, and there is plenty of scientific confirmation to show the damage caused by pesticides and monocultures. In order to understand this, we only have to think of areas of the world, for instance certain valleys in China, where pollination is now carried out by hand precisely as a result of uninhibited overuse of particular types of pesticides over time. Yet, the report approved today by the European Parliament has not taken a stance on this topic. We lack a critical objective on the toxicity of pesticides, specifically, the prohibition of systematic neurotoxins; we lack indications for the beekeeping sector relating to contamination of honey produce by GMO crops; we lack a critique on monoculture; and we lack the idea that large-scale changes are required in agriculture, including crop rotation, to reduce the use of pesticides, with a view to reversing the sharp decline in the production of pollinators.

 Mr President, in order to evaluate the report adopted today, we need to start by extrapolating two fundamental facts: the fact that the number of dependent people with disabilities will supposedly double by 2050, and the fact that, at the moment, we do not have a sufficient amount of data to gauge the severity of the problem. The challenge being addressed by means of this Disability Strategy 2010-2020 is to allow people with disabilities not only to enjoy human rights, just like everyone else, but also to ensure that those rights can be put into practice effectively. It is therefore essential to bring out disabled people’s full potential by encouraging them to train, providing them with freedom of movement and enabling them to access the labour market: by so doing, we will also be able to combat one of the biggest problems that adds to the misfortune of these people, namely, poverty.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the Green Paper on the modernisation of public procurement policy for two reasons in particular. Firstly, identification of the most economically advantageous tender which takes into account the entire life-cycle costs of the relevant goods, works or services and therefore not just the lowest price – a common, widespread consideration in all countries and all contracting authorities – which will improve quality, and, at the same time, place greater emphasis on the environmental and social sustainability of goods and services. Secondly, simplification, which will be achieved through greater flexibility, and which will allow for simpler procedures and offer small and medium-sized enterprises greater opportunities in the awarding of contracts. I would add, in particular, that in this regard, we should promote electronic procurement, which currently accounts for less than five per cent of all public procurement in the EU, and that the publication of calls for tender, divided into lots, will enable greater transparency when it comes to participation in tenders.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the whole package of six measures, this one therefore included, because they represent a fundamental transition towards true European governance. We are doing this in order to take responsibility and bring budgets under control, even where national governments, the governments of Member States, have failed to do so. This is, moreover, the moment at which the credibility of our institutions, of European institutions, is at stake. Europe is taking upon itself the duty of making its citizens’ demands its own and of securing that stability, that government in order to create the conditions for growth, without which there would not have been and could not now be a future for our citizens and especially for new generations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Ms Goulard on having tackled and completed such a difficult text: it too is a fundamental step in the direction of European governance. It is also a practical move on the part of Parliament to take forward the statements we have heard again today in plenary, but which are often not acted on. This is the specific call, I repeat, that we are also making to President Barroso, because everyone agrees when a statement of principle is made. There was agreement when the Commission’s programme was adopted in this House, but it needs to be implemented. This report is a specific step towards the implementation of that programme.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Haglund again here on the work he has done. I voted in favour of it, and in fact I welcome the entire package. The report introduces penalties for macroeconomic imbalances, but it should be said that those penalties are to be imposed only if Member States demonstrate an unwillingness to adopt the necessary corrective policies, because, if the finance situation does not improve, Mr De Angelis, there can be no prospect of growth, or no prospect of satisfactory and meaningful growth, anyway. For that reason I believe that the package that has been adopted today will serve as a basis for the growth that the Member States as a whole must in fact aim for. If we stop here, we will definitely not have achieved the objectives that we are setting ourselves, but in taking this step we will certainly be able to achieve that other objective. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation that we have adopted on the prevention of macroeconomic imbalances among the 27 countries is certainly a departure from the previous situation. It establishes rules and checks and, in particular, it introduces the concept of symmetry, which means that the Commission must assess not only deficits, but also surpluses. In practice, contrary to the commonly held view that there a few bad countries, such as Greece or Italy, countries such as Germany and the Netherlands are also being placed under supervision due to their overly low levels of domestic consumption. Furthermore, the regulation has an essentially federalist outlook and hence stresses the notion of fairness, which we believe is one of the positive elements that characterise the future of Europe and of the Member States – fairness and solidarity, which will be the preconditions for European growth. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out, now that we have reached the conclusion a year after the proposal was first tabled, that the Feio report reviews the Stability and Growth Pact and hence finally establishes a check requiring States with a debt/GDP ratio of more than 60% to achieve a 5% reduction. It does so by laying down and clarifying the debt criterion and the procedures on the pace that has to be followed. The Commission will have to consider a range of factors in this global economic context before assessing and making its recommendations to the Member State concerned. The report introduces the fundamental principle that reducing one’s debt means paying less interest and therefore being able to spend more on investment and growth, which is the real objective on which we will have to focus over the next few months.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, more than a year ago now, when the initial problems in the Greek economy, and then in the economies of other countries, began to emerge, I was interviewed by the European channel. One of the points I raised was precisely the attention paid to the statistical data that allowed some countries to fiddle their accounts. The Ford report, which we have voted on and approved today, by contrast lays down criteria on the transparency and independence of national statistical authorities, with penalties for those who commit forgery and fraud. It is a fundamental report, in that it aims to prevent a lack of transparency in the compilation of statistical data and ensures that those data are uniform. This will enable the European institutions and the governments of all the countries to proceed uniformly, in other words to have criteria that are not only based on knowledge but which are also uniform in terms of the actions carried out.

 Madam President, Commissioner Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased, and first of all, therefore, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Gardini, and the shadow rapporteurs for their fruitful collaboration on such a highly topical and extremely important dossier as this. As I was saying, we are pleased with the balanced, rational approach adopted in the report, which perfectly takes account of the principle of subsidiarity and the idea of a solidarity clause, which should guide the Member States’ actions in their response to disasters and in their civil protection role. Specifically, I believe it is necessary to develop a predictable, pre-planned system within the European Union’s Civil Protection Mechanism that is in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity. In other words, it must not involve setting up a supranational body, which would be liable to duplicate costs and powers without any assurance that it would work efficiently. I particularly welcome the attention devoted to extremely vulnerable areas such as islands, which is clearly expressed throughout the body of the report, as well as the emphasis on the link between disaster preparation, prevention and response, which make up an inseparable trio. Lastly, I am pleased to see how sensitively other Members have addressed the subject of major regional threats, which I believe deserves our attention; in particular, there have been many references to actions and strategies targeting forest fires.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted overall in favour of Mr Koch’s report because I agree with its targeted approach inasmuch as it asks the Commission for a concrete, circumstantiated commitment to road safety, including the development of the proposed models into a fully-fledged new action plan. The plan must incorporate a set of detailed measures, with clear timetables and monitoring instruments to assess the progress made, as well as a mid-term review. Conversely, I did not wish to support the idea of appointing an EU road safety coordinator, which, in my view, would be likely to duplicate powers and generate an excessively bureaucratic mechanism. Of course, it seems obvious that achieving the target of halving road accident victims by 2020 would also require a financial commitment that currently appears to be difficult to achieve. In conclusion, however, I regret the fact that the Committee on Transport and Tourism was not bold or ambitious enough to accept a complete harmonisation of important road safety rules, such as standardising the EU direction of travel in the United Kingdom and Malta as well, as I proposed in an amendment which the committee chose not to accept.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe I wish to express my satisfaction with the work that has been carried out. It is an historic step in the institutional evolution of Europe following the Treaty of Lisbon that for the first time competences are assigned to Parliament and the Commission in relation to tourism, which is the third component of the economy and of employment in Europe. First of all, I would like to stress that the text that is being put to the House today sets out a comprehensive governance that stems from Europe 2020 strategy and develops a series of proposals to achieve growth that is smart, sustainable and inclusive in every sense. Accordingly, it suggests specific programming instruments such as strategies for macro-regions, interregionality and joint and complementary planning. At times like these, when governance loses its bearings, we know what the negative effects are. Here, on the other hand, the dossier traces a very precise path. Out of these plans and instruments, I wish to call to mind the extraordinary plan to foster a progressive reduction in the seasonal nature of tourism, set out in paragraph 63 of the report. From the point of view of a European economy that, unfortunately, is losing a large share of industrial output, tourism can and must represent an important factor for overall growth, above all if the main public and private players can create an integrated approach between the different policies of the sector, the various financial instruments and build tourism into a real system that brings together the various economic sectors: agriculture, industry, craft, transport, services, and so on. I should mention that the text being voted upon contains numerous references to islands and remote areas which represent, as I was saying at the outset, a tangible way of achieving, through appropriate financial instruments, the criterion of inclusion sought by Europe 2020 strategy. Ladies and gentlemen, the tourism sector is also characterised by sustainable growth in environmental and social terms, which supports SMEs for which we have provided a business incubator tool, for innovation by way of supplying knowledge tools that will enable them to achieve, and the tourist to obtain, better travel solutions. Further, beyond the specific actions already put forward by the Commission I must give credit to Commissioner Tajani for the particular attention paid to SMEs and micro-enterprises, which must be singled out. In the report, they are regarded as guaranteeing innovation from the bottom up and they are expressly recognised as fulfilling the function of ensuring the quality, variety and authenticity of the different regions.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the compromise reached between Parliament and the European Council, European consumers will now be able to know where the meat on their table comes from. My amendment, which is taken up in the institutional compromise, was undoubtedly more ambitious and required more extensive marking of the origin and provenance of other products too – not just of meat, but of milk, dairy products in general and meat used as an ingredient in food. Nevertheless, it is satisfying to know that a road map has been established that will see the Commission present a specific report on this issue in two and three years’ time. The report will therefore include proposals to ensure the increased – not to say full – protection of all Europeans in the near future. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on which we voted today regarding European Union legislation on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, known as ‘mad cow disease’, testifies to the excellence of the European policies that have been adopted to protect human and animal health. The number of cases has certainly diminished in recent years, and this enables us to apply less alarming countermeasures, hence, for example, where a case appears in a herd, it is now possible to avoid culling the entire herd, but to use the milk produced until it is fully depleted. We all remember with great concern the images of entire herds slaughtered if one animal had contracted the disease, and that is something that we shall now avoid. We must, however, continue to be vigilant, Madam President, because the text we have adopted today introduces a considerable risk to health and opens the way to free use of animal meal. In this regard, we must remain vigilant. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Lepage for her determined work in bringing this dossier to a positive conclusion. I have been a staunch supporter of this report throughout, partly because I think it gives real legal value to the text we have adopted and also because it fills a legislative vacuum that has given rise to serious legal dispute between enterprises, public bodies and citizens. This measure avoids the colonisation of the Member States, leaving them free to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of genetically modified organisms. The amendments that this text brings in will therefore allow the individual Member States to ban the cultivation of GMOs due to the impact they may have on the agricultural system, particularly with regard to biodiversity, but also with regard to pesticide resistance, to the invasiveness of certain crops and, therefore, to the protection of our territories.

Mr President, the report by Mr Pieper on the post-2013 cohesion policy reduces the effects of a two-speed Europe. Indeed, only uniform growth can ensure proper cohesion between our territories and overall unity, even in diversity. I voted in favour of the text because it introduces an intermediate category, which allows may European regions to continue to benefit from the same amount of structural funds as they have done so far. The lack of efficient programming for the use of European funds has unfortunately resulted in many regions being unable to make proper use of the resources made available by the European Union, thereby risking a majority of the funds being left unused. Here, however, Brussels is sending out a positive message. We hope that our regions will know how to interpret and use the funds in the best possible way. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

I voted in favour of the identification of new parameters more representative of a country’s progress, and not just its consumption, although I think more should be done. The report in question has had a long and difficult journey, and finally made it to the plenary session having lost much of its content along the way. Parliament should have put forward a proposal taking into account factors including education, health and personal activities, but it confined itself to highlighting the need to establish new parameters, delegating the task of defining them to the Commission. Gross domestic product is an outdated indicator based on economic principles that, by reducing quality to quantity, overlook the meaning of things and individual and collective well-being, undervalue work in itself compared to the object of production, and consider only the production of new objects, not maintenance.

Mr President, as shadow rapporteur of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am completely satisfied with the outcome of today’s vote. The report by Mr Arsenis on the protection of forests is a policy report; it is a basis for confirming how the European Parliament intends to tackle the protection of our forest heritage and the adaptation of forests to climate change. Today, the European Parliament clearly expressed its point of view, in the light of which we expect the Commission to make the necessary proposals and so enable even more detailed policies to be drafted for the sector. I would particularly like to thank Mr Arsenis for his expert and professional work, which involved a long and difficult debate, because – as we are well aware – the forest situation is not the same in all the Member States. Despite this, we found common ground and also achieved some specific objectives, for example, the protection of certain parts from land speculation, greater protection of forests which are prized for their biodiversity, such as the northern Boreal and Mediterranean forests, and a ban on building on land cleared by arson. Mr President, as I have said, this is very important for many Mediterranean countries, including your own country, Greece. Giommaria Uggias,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has endorsed my recommendation for discharge to be granted to the European transport agencies, which support the European Commission. The discharge is granted because the Court of Auditors deemed that the annual accounts of the agencies were substantially reliable, although we must take note of and underscore a number of critical issues. Some of these issues are common to all the agencies or some of them, including for example: cancellations and delays in procurement procedures, failure to observe Staff Regulations, or the violation of the principle of budgetary annuality. These agencies’ commitment to overcome said problems should, however, be highlighted. In general terms, I should like to make two brief political observations, namely the lack of any multiannual programming – which is symptomatic of a leadership deficit – and the dearth of incisiveness in the work of some agencies, such as the European Railway Agency. In the same vein, I should like to note the delay – some two years after the fact – in setting up procedures to determine responsibility for the Viareggio disaster. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are taking a step forward in understanding that this is not a problem linked to some areas of Europe, Southern Europe or North Africa. However, my view of the measure is a positive one. I would like to ask Mr Tarabella whether he or the Commission does not think that the problem of application to veterinary services should also be tackled immediately, so that there could be a measure which would make it possible to eliminate the problem throughout the European Union.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important measure for the agricultural world. However, the measure needs to be followed up immediately by a commitment from the Council and national governments to adopt it forthwith, before the end of the season, in order to solve this problem which does not affect just the southern part of Europe, but the whole of Europe, as today’s vote has shown. Bluetongue affects the sheep and cattle on our farms. Therefore, taking action to totally eradicate it is a health policy objective which national governments can best contribute to through this measure by being flexible. It also needs to be immediately adopted through transposition of the directive. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian delegation from Italia dei Valori 
voted against the text of the resolution on nuclear power, because it was not clear enough to indicate a clear no to nuclear power. Unfortunately, all the amendments that could have improved the text and chosen a Europe free of nuclear power, immediately free of existing nuclear power stations and with no future nuclear power stations, were rejected. A Europe free of nuclear power is the only possible route if we want to guarantee that our children and future generations will have a future protected from the repetition of catastrophes like Fukushima and Chernobyl. These lessons tell us that there is no such thing as theoretical safety. That is why we have to say a clear no to the nuclear option and invest in research and innovation in other sources that are truly green, renewable and clean. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I worked as shadow rapporteur on this dossier and so could not but vote in favour, together with my group. I did so believing it to be a very useful tool for the development of a sector that will be a driving force for the European economy. Industry is moving away from Europe; agriculture suffers from serious deficiencies; meanwhile, tourism is one area that can certainly offer prospects for employment, economic development and intelligent, inclusive and compatible growth. To this end, the instrument we have approved today, which allows for more modern data gathering, processing, treatment and transmission than the previous situation, will surely give impetus to this activity. This is why the ALDE Group and I have voted in favour. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measure we have voted on today is of some help in clarifying the phenomenon of migration flows and praises the work of Frontex. I think this should be seen positively and therefore so should the result of the vote. I do, however, believe that this stance should be accompanied by equal clarity on the part of the Member States, because this challenge affects not only the European Institutions but also policy in the Member States. I must say, however, that so far not all Member States have implemented and practiced such clarity, starting with the policy of the Italian Government, which has dealt with the situation in Lampedusa in a most objectionable and questionable manner. Thousands of migrants there have been essentially abandoned to their fate, whilst human solidarity – never mind legal solidarity – would have led to immediate care and certainly greater respect than has been shown, notwithstanding the fact that the legal problem would then have to be dealt with, as we have done in this House.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a staunch supporter of the anti-nuclear cause I backed this report not only because I think the decommissioning of these plants is of benefit to all, but also because I hope that no more will be able to be built. Today we are faced with a ticking time-bomb across Europe. The operation of nuclear power plants for civilian purposes is founded on engineering practices which are now outdated and anachronistic. It can be said that their safety is ever more theoretical: everything will be fine, as long as nothing happens. In fact, we are dealing with protocols from 50 years ago which, in reality, are not protected against events that may be increasingly unforeseeable. Terrorist attacks could not have been foreseen and nor could the natural and disastrous events – not only earthquakes – which unfortunately are increasingly frequent in our disaster-stricken world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the committee Chair, Brian Simpson, for leading the work of the committee and work on the file, and, above all, for having allowed its conclusion – at least I hope so because the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) will be voting for this – and approval on first reading, and hence the successful conclusion of the regulation. This task actually involves reviewing the regulation, which sets out to establish a common framework for the collection of statistics on tourism and, more specifically, for all its stages, ranging from the collection to the processing, treatment and transmission of statistics, enabling optimum knowledge of the financial world that is activated and revolves around tourism. Mr President, it is clear that, since the 1995 directive, which is the predecessor of this directive, remarkable growth has been recorded in tourism and we must acknowledge, in particular, the great prospects that the economic system of tourism will contribute to the European economy as a whole in the near future. I worked on the file as a shadow rapporteur for the ALDE Group and, as I said earlier, we are going to vote in favour of it. I think the Simpson report will be particularly popular due to the notion of tourism satellite accounts, namely, the adoption of pilot projects that will make it possible to assess the economic impact on individual sectors of the economy, in other words, aspects relating to same-day visits, the evaluation report to be drawn up every five years and the possibility, indeed the necessity, of a five-yearly report to assess the effects of statistics. I will conclude by saying that this is part of the new responsibility arising out of the Treaty of Lisbon and I think this time, we are beginning to assume the responsibilities of Parliament effectively and we will do the same with the next file being worked on, soon to arrive in this Chamber.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we were delighted to adopt the measures proposed by Mrs Podimata. For those of us in the Italian delegation of the Italia dei Valori
 party within the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, this was a moment of great satisfaction, because it shows that Parliament knows how to follow up its statements of principle. In fact, as early as the debate on the report by Mrs Berès on the financial, economic and social crisis, we had argued in favour of a tax on financial transactions. This was done today, so we are delighted to declare that we voted in favour because this tax will shift financial resources from the financial economy – and therefore away from financial speculation – to the real economy. The tax will also respond to the Millennium Development Goals and contribute to large European projects in infrastructure, research, ecological restructuring and in our system of production.

 Mr President, the resolution adopted today has established important principles for the protection of consumers, increasing safeguards against the spread of falsified medicinal products. This is an extremely dangerous phenomenon, and one of the most significant remedies has been to stem the online sale of medicines of dubious origin. Moreover, through the adoption of a number of guarantees, we will establish strict regulations that require permits and inspections. This does not, however, mean that forms of health protection and medical prescriptions are cancelled out. It must be remembered that the legislative power of Member States is unaffected in this respect and that they may retain or limit the ban on the online sales of drugs within their territory. This is an opportunity for Member States to better regulate the matter, but we must remember, Mr President, that citizens can order medicines from another Member State and that this regulation should not be seen as another opportunity to benefit the pharmaceutical industry. Instead we must continue to progress along the trail of liberalisation that the EU is currently blazing by adopting measures such as this. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Cancian on his excellent work in bringing this measure to its conclusion. Mr Mastella will allow me to disagree with him on the idea that this measure represents a great victory for our citizens. One cannot but note that citizens are only protected if they travel further than 250 km by coach or bus. Where is the protection for the rights of citizens of Europe if – as Mrs Meissner has already stressed – entire States such as Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are excluded from this protection? These are the reasons why our group abstained in the vote. We did not vote against the report because some rights are protected, such as those of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. That is why we abstained. As for the rest of it, we would ask to return to the issue as soon as possible in order to really protect our citizens. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Madam President, when, a century ago, Antonio Meucci’s patent was not recognised by the American telephony industry, it was not because of a lack of English or his use of Italian, but instead the failure to meet a condition: he did not have the money to register his patent for another year. In a similar vein, we are now in a paradoxical situation and, quite apart from the vote, I think that the fact that a trilingual patent system is to be adopted, which excludes Italian, is basically a sign of the weakness of our government, its inability to make its voice heard in European politics, and the weakness of our political system, which reflects, above all, on research and innovation. On this issue, we need only recall the competitiveness study published last December, which shows that in recent years, Italy has willingly handed over EUR 4 billion to other countries that have welcomed our researchers. These researchers certainly no longer have any need for Italian, since they have learnt English, French and German and have all the tools required to submit these patents, to the detriment of Italian products.

Madam President, I mostly support the amendments proposed through this text, which in any case essentially does nothing more than codify previous legislation regarding the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and animal feedingstuffs. We are forgetting and letting it pass somewhat unnoticed that we are talking about waste from nuclear accidents. This means that we have to continue to pay close attention to the risks of nuclear plants and to the fact that these are the consequences of the rotten and poisonous results of what, in certain States, we insist on developing. It is therefore a measure that must inspire us all to be as vigilant as possible. Getting to the heart of the matter, I do, however, think that more could be done to bring in compulsory immediate notification, which would allow all risk factors to be dealt with together. Furthermore, there should be no way to avoid the requirement to notify government authorities in the event of an accident. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we have adopted the resolution on waste in Campania, which should be a lesson to us all to prevent environmental disasters like this from happening. We can feel pleased with ourselves today, because in this plenary we have adopted a measure like this, which makes a culture of recycling and reuse at a time of globalisation a measure to be promoted and encouraged in every possible way to ensure that European citizens, who are now free from the effort of producing the goods that are now within everyone’s reach, are aware of their real value. Mr Florenz’s report on the reuse of electrical and electronic equipment, on which we are voting today, is important not only for the future of environmental sustainability in Europe, but also for another aspect: the loss of raw materials. In fact, the efficient and innovative use of materials and resources is a key issue in the globalised economy. I therefore consider it positive that we have set ourselves ambitious targets and also that the actual cost of a product should be indicated in such a way that consumers become aware of it.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent weeks, the various parliamentary committees that are dealing with the issue of the common agricultural policy have been looking into the matter of the post-2013 reform. Clearly, food security is one of the fundamental elements of agriculture. This consideration must therefore be viewed in the light of the report being put to the vote today, in which food security is defined as a fundamental right that must accordingly be safeguarded in every possible way. Such attention is required, Mr President, whenever there is an emergency, such as that linked to the dioxin scandal that we are witnessing at the moment, with the discovery that dioxin is being used in animal feed, but also, and above all, to ensure that we have a common production process that respects the production sector as a whole, that respects the quality of farmers’ work, the environment and marketing, and hence, that respects consumers. This report forms part of a set of measures that this House has developed to promote agriculture, and I can therefore say that I am satisfied. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is one of the pillars of the European Union. There is no doubt that, under the same general conditions, enterprises can produce and sell their products and services without public support, but not all sectors and not all areas are operating under conditions of parity. It is therefore fair, as in this instance, to correct situations of economic disadvantage and allow productive businesses to remain on the market and maintain employment levels, as in Sulcis for example, where 500 families would have found themselves without work, without income and without dignity. We must realise that when we speak of coal, we are talking about areas that have no alternative to mines and should be allowed the opportunity to adopt production technologies that are competitive and compatible with the free market and with the environment. Logically, postponing the deadline to 2018 must represent an imperative to ensure that institutions and companies take immediate action to develop technological, financial and environmental compatibility conditions that are in line with the challenges that await us.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, 14 February, is European Epilepsy Day. This is a condition from which 6 million European citizens suffer, of whom some 300 000 are Italians. It is therefore important that associations, including the Italian Epilepsy Association, dedicated to increase awareness of such a serious condition about which there is still much ignorance, a lack of clear information and regarding which many extremely delicate aspects remain unknown, should organise meeting opportunities over this period. Some steps forward have been made in the last few years at European level, especially through a 2009 directive, but there is still much to do, especially to guarantee full civil rights to sufferers from this condition in the world of work and of mobility, and in guaranteeing the availability of medication during school hours. I therefore consider days of reflection on such fundamental aspects of these problems to be very important. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the waste crisis in Campania, which was adopted by a majority today, is a very important sign. The emergency in Campania has become a European emergency, and that is a decision in favour of the people of Campania. We are saying ‘no’ to the disbursement of funds that are used simply to strengthen corrupt politicians, unscrupulous businessmen and organised crime; ‘yes’ to European money if a credible, environmentally friendly waste plan is put forward; ‘no’ to uncontrolled landfill in national parks; ‘no’ to dioxin-producing incinerators; and ‘yes’ to recycling and environmentally friendly methods. We are also saying ‘no’ to the criminalisation of dissent in local communities, and therefore ‘yes’ to legality. It is an important turning point and a warning to the Berlusconi Government and the regional government run by Stefano Caldoro, which so far have done nothing but talk and bolster up their cliques and the Mafia establishment. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
). 
 – (IT)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the lies told by the Berlusconi government, which assumed office in 2008 telling Italians that the waste problem had been resolved, the European Union is doing the right thing by refusing to grant Italy funding until an environmentally friendly waste system based on recycling of waste and composting has been presented. That system is certainly not provided for by Mr Caldoro’s plan, which is based once again on uncontrolled landfills such as the ones at Chiaiano, Taverna del Re and Terzigno – the Terzigno landfill is actually inside Vesuvius National Park – nor by incinerators, which cause death, cancers and full-blown health crises. In the 13 years that the environmental crisis has been going on, public funds in Campania have strengthened the criminal links between politicians, both on the left and on the right, businessmen and the Camorra. Furthermore, environmental issues are not resolved by criminalising dissent or by criminalising local communities, families and the region, as the Italian Government has done by using batons to restrain anyone who defends the environment and the land. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that if we can now talk about a reduction in errors, we owe this to the skill, independence and professionalism of the Court of Auditors, and I should like President Caldeira to take note of this. I believe that, as well as the Commission, Parliament played an important part in this improvement, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control, which sets great store by the subject of transparency and the effective and efficient use of public funds. We must still see what we can do to improve, however, because there are still too many things that are not right, particularly in very sensitive sectors such as agriculture and cohesion, with often worrying error rates in sectors where fraud in areas such as contracts and over-invoicing is rife. I believe that it is necessary to lower the rate of bureaucracy and reduce pointless red tape and instead introduce a few clear rules to send out a very clear and determined ‘no’ to every form of fraud in sectors where corruption is endemic. Another important factor is to step up the role of OLAF, the anti-fraud office, to combat all forms of fraud and corruption. Another aspect that we cannot fail to emphasise – we learned this also from a recent visit by the Committee on Budgetary control to Italy – is that there is also a risk of the forceful influence of organised crime and forms of corruption on public funds. The role of OLAF could therefore be essential from this viewpoint, together with greater cooperation between Member States, the Commission and Parliament. Another absolutely essential point is that I believe the Commission must strengthen its independence from Member States. I believe that we must block funds to prevent repetition of this type of behaviour, particularly in states where serious errors – I am not talking about minor errors – and very substantial episodes of fraud have been going on for years. The credibility level of the European Parliament and the European institutions is determined greatly by the level of transparency and correctness with which public funds are spent. I therefore believe that we have room for improvement on this score. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find President Sarkozy’s decision to be very serious: once again, in an effort to conceal internal political problems – as has already happened in Italy – he is attempting to regain support by criminalising outsiders and migrants, playing on people’s anxieties over social safety. Before Europe becomes the Europe of markets, it must be the Europe of rights, the Europe of solidarity and the Europe of inclusion. This is why President Sarkozy’s statement was immediately followed by the very serious statement by the Italian Minister for the Interior, who wishes to adopt the Sarkozy method and extend it to EU citizens, expelling them without incomes or homes. Therefore, rather than promoting inclusion policies, policies that reduce social inequalities and seek to unite people, the aim is once again to criminalise people. This is very serious because migrants, outsiders, those who are considered to be on the fringes of society are useful when they are needed, for example, for illegal work; in other words, when they have duties to perform but no rights. If an outsider, a Roma or a migrant commits a crime, he is punished, but this must not be a pretext for justifying very serious expulsions. The Commission must react if it wants a Europe of solidarity, equality and freedom. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when building a Europe of rights, an essential part is played by freedom of information, pluralism of information and independence of information. Is the Commissioner aware that there is one country in the European Union – which is incidentally a founder member of the European Union under the Treaty of Rome – where there is no media pluralism, where a prime minister directly or indirectly controls the public and private TV and print media? What democratic electoral competition can exist in a country where a prime minister – a political party – controls the media? What democracy can exist in a country where a law that bans journalists from publishing judicial news is about to be approved in a matter of days? Forget about Watergate and the press upholding a regime! We are talking lapdogs here! What sort of democratic country wants to control the Internet? What sort of democratic country sidelines anyone who strays from the party line and fails to guarantee free speech and the right to dissent? We are not describing Sudan under Bokassa or Romania under Ceauşescu: this is Italy under Berlusconi, where such things are unfortunately allowed to happen, not least because the European Commission does not have the courage to adopt an independent and free stance with regard to the Member States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to highlight the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I proposed together with four other MEPs, and which half of the European Parliament, plus one, approved, with the aim of committing the Council and Commission to legislation that is truly effective in fighting corruption. I have returned from a visit to Greece on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control and one of the reasons behind the Greek structural crisis is certainly the squandering of public money, something which also occurs in Italy: Italy is eaten away by corruption, as we have recently seen. This corruption mainly hinges on the illegal management of public money, and the relationship between one political faction and a faction of businessmen and white-collar organised crime. It is important for the European Parliament to make its full pressure felt on the Commission and on Member States – Member States that do not conform should be penalised – and for the European institutions responsible for controlling corruption and the fight against organised crime to be strengthened. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recently, there has been yet another environmental disaster in Italy, on the River Lambro and the River Po. Also recently, the Court of Justice in Luxembourg condemned Italy for endangering public health with their illegal waste disposal and their inability to control the collection of waste in Campania. An increase in cases of leukaemia has been reported recently in Taranto through the Ilva steelworks, as well asbestos removal in schools in Crotone and dioxins in Campania. It is an ongoing environmental disaster. I strongly ask the Commission what it intends to do to ensure that the Italian Government falls in line with standards of the European Union directives, particularly with regard to the recent ruling by the Court of Justice, which strongly condemned Italy for not being able to dispose of waste in Campania. For many weeks and months, the city of Naples was a laughing stock all over the world. Luigi de Magistris,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome and thank the President of the Court of Auditors, with whom we have worked productively during this period. As Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I have always maintained that the role played by the Court of Auditors is fundamental. It is fundamental because the Court operates in a very sensitive sector, which people throughout the European Union watch with great interest and with a critical eye where the transparency, accuracy and legality of expenditure and of the management of public funds are concerned. I believe that it must be reiterated today that the Court should always be guaranteed independence and autonomy when carrying out its work because this is fundamental if we are to be able to evaluate properly and to make good decisions. Likewise, we ask the Court to put Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control in a position to carry out their own work as productively as possible. We must find the right balance which allows public funds to be spent effectively and efficiently, because these funds are aimed at important objectives such as economic development and job creation. At the same time, there must be severe punishments for serious irregularities and errors, which the Court has also uncovered in the last financial year, whilst an attempt must be made to avoid unnecessary formalities and red tape. As Mr Kallas was also saying, Parliament must strive to find an equilibrium in the tolerable risk of error. The report, which we have read with great interest, provides some insights, but also includes many grey areas. We must strive to achieve the best results regarding these grey areas. As my fellow Members have also mentioned, the main problems primarily concern the Structural and Cohesion Funds. It is true that the Court, in doing its job, points out errors and irregularities in relation to these funds. However, those who are able to look deeply into and to analyse matters can see that, behind the errors highlighted, there are even graver issues, as the judicial experiences of several countries in recent years demonstrate. There may be fraud, there may be deception. I am specifically referring to one or two errors revealed such as the contravention of rules on procurement, over-invoicing and so on. We must endeavour to make improvements in this area. I believe that the Commission should promote Member States which behave in a virtuous manner, and punish and penalise Member States which do comply with the rules. Furthermore, I believe it is very important for OLAF to use the Court of Auditors’ suggestions as a starting point and to further improve its work because it is in everyone’s interest that it does so. I think it is only through cooperation among various institutions, namely Parliament, the Court of Auditors and OLAF, that we will manage to safeguard the financial interests of all EU citizens.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I must acknowledge the very important work accomplished by the committee and the excellent job done by the rapporteur, as well as the political solidarity that has been on show. This is because, from the outset, we wished to send a very clear message: we intend to work with great rigour to ensure transparency, accuracy and legality in the management of public funds and, therefore, in auditing the budgets. Very significant progress has been made with the Council, which at first did not want to respond. I would like to personally congratulate the Swedish Presidency on this. It has always set out to act to promote transparency and accuracy. From that point of view, we therefore expect further progress, because obviously it is absolutely unacceptable, particularly with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, that Parliament should not have the information and details required to monitor budgets and public funds, in the interest not only of the European Union but also of all European citizens. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening’s very interesting debate has helped us to understand some very important points, particularly concerning the European Crime Prevention Network. Firstly, now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament’s role in the framework of codecision procedure must be increasingly enhanced, and in two ways. First, culture: organised crime and mafia organisations can be eliminated above all with information and awareness. A great Italian judge, Giovanni Falcone, who was murdered by the Mafia, used to say that the latter was a phenomenon that had a beginning and an end. The end must consist of a huge mobilisation in cultural terms, and it must start in Europe and in Parliament. A second point is that organised crime must be combated more effectively, above all with the introduction of the European public prosecution service, and I think also with the inclusion of certain very serious crimes, foreseen only in certain Member States. I am thinking, for instance, of mafia crimes. We must understand that the mafia crisis concerns the whole of Europe, since mafia organisations have the capacity to penetrate right through institutions as well. There is a very close relationship between mafia organisations and corruption, as recent reports have also emphasised, and fraud in the European Union, as we were recently told by the European Court of Auditors too. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that Parliament should be very concerned by the latest report from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation. Indeed, while some governments in the European Union, and most recently the Italian Government, continue to make immigration a criminal offence, violate the right to asylum and indiscriminately refuse entry, I believe that we need strong cooperation since it is a disgrace that the level of poverty described by the FAO in Africa, the Middle East and Asia still exists. Cooperation does not mean undertaking pointless projects which merely generate business for the same old companies, but helping these countries to emancipate themselves. Another disgrace which Parliament needs to address is the privatisation of water, something in which certain governments of the EU engage. Water is a resource that belongs to everyone, an essential resource and not a commodity at the service of the multinationals. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, I would like to talk about the tragedy in Messina – which the President of the European Parliament has recalled today – and its dozens of casualties. So another tragedy has been reported in Italy: the Italian Prime Minister has even claimed that it was a foreseeable tragedy. It may have been foreseeable, but nothing was done to prevent it. Nothing was done because the area is ruled by concrete, by the concrete mafia, by the forest mafia, with their forest fires. However, what the European Parliament should focus on above all is the way in which public money and also the aid allocated by the European Union can be invested in a different form of regional development, to ensure that construction work is carried out properly and the severe environmental damage that has been done can be rectified. More often than not, these public funds end up being pocketed by criminal societies, corrupt politicians and the Mafia. This legislative term must therefore focus on what happens to public funds, which should really be used to restore nature, to protect natural resources, to generate eco-friendly economic development and to create jobs. There must be no more horrific tragedies like the one in Messina. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important decision. The debate has become quite heated but that is because the industrial and employment situation in our countries is extremely difficult. This is an important decision in both real and symbolic terms, since we are dealing with a matter of principle. We must send out a sign of legality and respect in view of the all of the efforts being made by our business world. When I say ‘our world’, I do not mean it in a protectionist sense; I mean that the business community looks to the decision-making in Strasburg and Brussels with a feeling of belonging, searching for guarantees that only the Commission, Parliament, our institutions, can provide for fairer trade. However, we must tread cautiously: this is also a business world that looks at China as a great export opportunity, and that in certain sectors is actually managing to stay afloat precisely because of the market it has managed to develop in China. Thus we are not attempting to be protectionist and raise barricades. We simply do not want to be deceived, especially in an area such as photovoltaics, so crucial for our sustainable future. However, Commissioner, we must try to speed up this investigation so that any compensation can be estimated and claimed much sooner than planned. Moreover, since all of this debate is really about what to do in the wake of something that has already happened, we must also work on prevention. We should therefore strengthen the bilateral agreements to avoid any repeat of this kind of situation with China or other countries in future. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the list of tragedies in Cambodia is very long indeed: crimes against the environment, stratospheric corruption, waste of international aid, aggression against human rights activists, and a very shrewd dictator, who plays with democracy to give himself a semblance of legitimacy and who is still there. Now there is also the issue of the leader of the opposition, who is exiled from Cambodia. Yet I believe there is also another misfortune in that country, and that is an international community that is too obliging, and I have to say that that includes the European Union. Accompanying Graham Watson during our delegation’s visit to Cambodia, we felt that the Commission’s attitude was not sufficiently firm and robust. In Parliament, there is a robustness in the various debates on Cambodia that I would like to see in the other institutions too. Within the framework of European cooperation, I think it important to reflect on the case of Sam Rainsy who, among other things, won, through the efforts of the European People’s Party, an important human rights prize here in this institution. Perhaps that is the acid test, to try to have him return before the elections. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, well done to Russia for its accession to the World Trade Organisation, and I agree with the various boundaries set and the guidance given in the resolution. As a member of the delegation to the EU-Kazakhstan, EU-Kyrgyzstan and EU-Uzbekistan Parliamentary Cooperation Committees, and for relations with Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Mongolia, I would like to add something else that has not yet been mentioned in this debate, namely that Russia has made an effort to redraft its position both with respect to the WTO, and therefore the international community and particularly the Western nations and, through the Customs Union, with respect to the Eurasian countries. I believe we need to think carefully about the compatibility of the WTO and Russia’s accession to it, the new bilateral agreement being negotiated with Russia by the EU, and the Customs Union. I think this is one of the most complicated aspects. We do not yet know how the Customs Union will evolve, or whether as expected it will lead to a common economic area based on the four freedoms of movement that exist in the EU, but I believe that we should be taking an integrated approach to Russia on the one hand and Central Asia on the other. There is no point in creating antagonism between these two areas, bearing in mind the umbilical cord that links Russia with Central Asia. For example, we need to try to ensure that the Customs Union’s standards as regards safety and anti-trust rules are still in line with European standards, and I am also wondering what good the abolition of the visa system will do in these negotiations.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, in itself the Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is an excellent piece of work. It focuses on simplification, which is certainly desirable, but, to be frank, it would be naive to consider it a technical agreement. There is a long list of requests to the Israeli authorities from the European Union, from the High Representative, from our consulates in East Jerusalem, and from this Parliament on the settlements in the West Bank, on the continuing annexation of East Jerusalem, on the situation in Gaza and on the resumption of the peace process. If we look at what the EU has obtained with these requests, we see neither real progress nor any serious concessions. I therefore consider this to be anything but a politically neutral measure. My delegation will vote against the ACAA and I am calling on the Commission, should the ACAA be approved, to exercise the highest possible degree of oversight, both in terms of traceability of products to the Occupied Territories, which is a problem that has nothing to do with the good faith of the Commission but rather with Israel, and extension of the agreement to other products without the involvement of the European Parliament.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tone of this debate has changed since June, when we were among the few voices calling for a swift launch to negotiations for a free trade agreement. Japan has always been a very complex case, more difficult to deal with, understand and decipher than many other countries. We now find ourselves under strong pressure from the Member States and many sectors to move as slowly as possible in the direction of a free trade agreement, as if Japan were enemy number one of European industry. I urge the Commission to proceed with a dual approach. On the one hand, it must be firm, since we have included several conditions in our resolution that are entirely advantageous, with great emphasis on non-tariff barriers. However, an effort must also be made to ensure that it is used as far as possible to provide opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, to create the possibility of cultural cooperation with Japan – since as a country it is an ideal candidate with great potential in this area – and to undertake joint scientific research with one of the leading innovators. The second approach should be to make the agreement a success, since it is much more important than so many other agreements in geopolitical terms. It can serve to stabilise relations with South Korea and our economic and trade relations with China. Let us recall that we are dealing with a great democracy, and that this is one of the chief aspects of the agreement. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we support the proposal resulting from the compromise in the Committee on International Trade. We believe a very reasonable balance has been achieved. On one hand, we have a firm date, a deadline. I would ask you all to consider how absurd it would be to reject the committee’s proposal while we have obligations in the World Trade Organisation that we have to fulfil. On the other hand, we are allowing a couple of years more, thereby at least partly meeting the demands of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. I think this debate needs to be kept in proportion. After all, as the Commissioner pointed out in his speech as well, we are talking about an extremely limited volume of trade, although the decision we make tomorrow will be very important to some ACP capitals. There is a kind of asymmetry between the significance that we attach to what is at stake and how certain ACP countries perceive it. I do not believe that setting such a tight deadline – which might almost seem like an imposition, at least in the eyes of some ACP countries – is an effective way of bringing the negotiations on economic partnership agreements to a swifter conclusion. We do want these agreements. However, these partnership agreements need to be concluded in the best possible way, through persuasion and trying to win the other side round. These two extra years, if they are indeed both necessary, could be an opportunity for us to step up our negotiating efforts, not least by expanding the range of people we talk to in addition to just the governments. The general public in these countries remains somewhat wary, so we must also focus on the members of the national parliaments, who often do not ratify agreements but do carry political weight and influence in the debate in their countries and complain that they are not given enough information. As I proposed during our ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Horsens, it may perhaps be necessary to organise public seminars with the media and non-governmental organisations to explain our position properly. There is a Kenyan proverb that says ‘If you want to go far, go together’. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in November 2010, many of us asked the Commission to wait before signing the agreement and present an impact assessment first. The Commission decided to go ahead and sign straight away, assuring us that everything was fine, only to subsequently turn to the Court of Justice and receive a worrying warning from the EU privacy supervisor. Meanwhile, citizens in the EU mobilised in an unprecedented way, with 2.8 million signatures, whilst many entrepreneurs have reacted cautiously with regard to the future of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), precisely because they believe that existing laws can protect them just as effectively. I think that there are two lessons in this, and I hope that the Commission will learn from them with regard to the next measures announced by the Commissioner. The first lesson is that the Web is now considered by European citizens to be a real common good, like biodiversity or water. It is considered a space for individual freedom that must not be threatened by any kind of measure. In Washington, Senator Wyden, Chair of the Subcommittee on International Trade, whom I visited last February, told us that with ACTA, experiences such as Wikipedia
 might have not come into being. I do not know if this statement corresponds to the truth, but we must also adopt the precautionary principle. Secondly, we cannot implement important measures without the citizens’ approval, and there is a need for debate, which so far has been clearly insufficient. I think this should be understood and, if we do not understand it, I believe we will not go very far in today’s Europe. I became familiar with ACTA just after I was elected. I have followed this agreement as shadow rapporteur in a thousand debates in committee, in plenary, – and I have to say the Commission has always shown a very loyal and cooperative attitude – in interviews and in debates with civil society. I do not know if this will be the last debate. I must say that we will certainly be ready for further discussion and, Commissioner, I really do not hope that we will be able to say ‘acta est fabula’
, the play is over. This is in the public interest, in the interest of freedom of expression and, I must say, in the interest of the European institutions’ image as well. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there have been delays in dealing with this agreement in the Committee on International Trade (INTA), but there are many other very different kinds of delays on the ground with regard to improving the condition of the Palestinian population. This is a debate on how to prevent products from the settlements from benefiting from this agreement – this is a red line that cannot be crossed. I appreciate what the Commissioner has said, but it is also true that so far, we have not had any mechanisms that have worked. It is also a debate on the political impact of this agreement, because I believe, indeed I fear, that its adoption would be interpreted as opening a credit line in favour of a government that does not give much credit, so to speak, to questions from the European Union. No tangible progress in the resumption of negotiations, much less on the continued expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem, much less with regard – apart from some modest progress – to the Gaza blockade. For this reason, the treatment of this dossier is more than technical; it is a highly political dossier, not a trivial one, and we call upon the Commission to assess how a trade policy measure can, as is normal in this context, become a foreign policy act on the ground.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it would be a shame if Parliament and the Council failed to give the green light to negotiations with Japan, though this time around asking for something we have never previously asked for in similar situations. I agree with the rapporteur Metin Kazak: if there are no negotiations, Japan will look further east – as Mr Susta said just now – to the rest of Asia and to the Pacific rather than to Europe. Such a closure would be paradoxical for us, given that it is a fully democratic country, whereas we have ongoing negotiations with other countries that are dictatorships in one way or another, such as Vietnam or Singapore. Moreover, let there be no talk about the European crisis as a reason for holding back such negotiations. The crisis will not be defeated by clamping shut like a clam, through protectionism. The crisis will be defeated by open, intelligent trade, by a wisdom that we have perhaps not always had, and by basing our stance on reciprocity, as I – together with Mr Daul, Mr Guerrero Salom, Mr Susta and Ms Muscardini – called for in written statement No 0016/2012 on fair trade, which I invite you all to sign. In this case, it means not closing the door on Japan, but negotiating measures to ensure the removal of non-tariff barriers, bilateral safeguards for sensitive sectors – and we can strengthen such safeguards – the protection of geographical indications for our products, the removal of barriers that hamper trade today, especially for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which could otherwise find a further outlet in Japan, the opening up of Japanese public procurement to our companies, including SMEs, a mechanism for judging business disputes which today we are finding hard to put in place, as well as cooperation on post-Fukushima energy, based on sustainable development. These and other things we can ask for and obtain from Japan. We cannot agree with simply giving up from the start. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats fully supports the new generalised scheme of tariff preferences (GSP), which rationalises the mechanism and makes it more consistent with its constituent objectives of support for countries in the developing world. Congratulations to the rapporteur, Christofer Fjellner, who managed to strike a balance between the various options. There are now two commitments to undertake immediately. We need to coordinate the application of GSP with that of bilateral free trade agreements, first and foremost, so as not to alter the preferential nature of GSP for developing countries, which could even find themselves penalised by less favourable access conditions than those granted to the beneficiaries of bilateral agreements. Even more important is the monitoring of its entry into force, especially of effective compliance with international conventions on human rights, trade union rights, environmental protection and the rule of law. In this area, we have important news: the burden of proof is reversed, meaning it will be up to countries that are potentially non-compliant with these conventions to demonstrate that they are using the criteria of good governance and respect for human rights, by virtue of which they may enjoy this generalised system of preferences. The fact that information on this matter may come not only from the international organisations themselves, promoters of these conventions, but also from Parliament, the Council and especially from civil society, transforms this scheme into a much more participatory and democratic one. There are no less than 27 conventions to observe, including the United Nations one on climate change. This part of the scheme, without which this good work would, for the most part, be in vain, now needs to be fully implemented. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, in our view there are two basic elements here. The first is the issue of democracy, which means full involvement of the European Parliament in decisions on macro-financial assistance (MFA), its implementation and its suspension. Given that these are not technical or executive decisions, it is important that Parliament always be called upon to give its opinion. The second is political conditionality. As has already been pointed out, there is no point in setting up a European External Action Service if it is not fully involved in decisions as important as macro-financial assistance; there is no point in focusing on human rights and then failing to take them into account when making important decisions. I will add a third issue, which I regard as important: Central Asia is not mentioned explicitly among the beneficiaries of MFA, even though they are countries with which we have important economic relations. The European Union has its own specific strategy on Central Asia and it is vital that macro-financial assistance be one of its pillars. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, South Sudan no longer represents the good news we were still hoping for just one year ago. The peoples of South Sudan and of Sudan are enjoying neither peace, stability nor, least of all, development. ‘Walk on your own two legs, walk for a long time, find water and share it’, goes an old saying from the region, but this certainly does not reflect reality. Today, at the most, people walk for a long time but, if they have not stepped on a mine first, water is not easy to find until the rainy season. In fact, it is not easy to help Juba, just as it is not easy to put pressure on Khartoum. However, I believe that action by the Commission, the European External Action Service and the European Union ought to be based on certain fundamental principles. Above all, we must keep attention focused on this crisis, so that it does not risk becoming a forgotten crisis, one of those points on the agenda that is shelved and deprived of the attention of the media and the international community. Secondly, we must insist on full application of Security Council Resolution 2046, which is a key element. Thirdly, we must not be unprepared for what may happen in Khartoum, keeping in mind the fact that Sadiq al-Mahdi, former Sudanese prime minister, evoked the prospect of an Arab Spring in Sudan, in view of the failures both of the administration and of President al-Bashir himself. Let us therefore remain vigilant, to avoid a recurrence of what happened in North Africa. Fourthly, as we are the main donor to South Sudan, we should have more say in the application of laws in Juba. Currently, uniformed soldiers in South Sudan are appropriating land in an arbitrary fashion. The Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement must re-establish its credibility as far as citizens are concerned, which will be quite difficult without a minimum legal system that is effective and independent. This ought to be the European Union’s first priority. Without delay, I will finish with a final point, to which we have already drawn attention: the creation for South Sudan of a transparent fund to collect the proceeds of oil resources, as happened in Timor. Objections may be made that Timor was good news: well, we would like South Sudan to be good news too. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, Ms de Sarnez, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome this report by the vice-chair of the Liberal and Democratic group, a group that believes, perhaps more than others, in trade as a means of spreading well-being and stability worldwide. This is, nevertheless, a report that cuts to the heart of several matters, provocatively at times and without mincing words right from the introduction. There, it clearly states that, on the one hand, China is getting the most from its membership of the World Trade Organisation while, on the other, its economy is not fully recognised as a market economy. It is a slightly anomalous economy, run by the Communist party, with tariff and non-tariff barriers, discrimination in many sectors, subsidies, obstacles of various kinds, bars to participation in public tenders, export credits and much more besides. What is to be done, then, about China, given that it is a country with which we now have considerable economic and trade interpenetration? The first answer from this report is reciprocity, a principle that is seldom practised nowadays and is not easy to enact, but which is the key to this relationship. At the end of the day, is it really that difficult to make it happen? In recent weeks, with several colleagues – Mr Daul, Chair of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats); Mr Guerrero Salom, Vice-chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament; Mr Susta; and Ms Muscardini – we have been working on written statement No 16, with the aim of basing our trade policy on some key concepts: reciprocity, the agreement of environmental and social parameters, transparency, consumer protection, World Trade Organisation rules, and human rights. Tibet has already been mentioned. These are not slogans but values, which – as this report states – if put into practice in our trade relations, represent the best approach not only for sustainable trade, but also for a less extreme and happier China.

 Mr Martin, I believe that China’s membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is a good thing; it would be a mistake to have China outside the WTO, because matters would become much more complicated. Besides, the battles fought by the Commission, among others, within the WTO through various disputes – such as that on raw materials – have been very effective and satisfying. Furthermore, the WTO can certainly also be relied upon as regards various anti-dumping procedures. That does not mean, however, that we can lower our guard when it comes to granting China market economy status, on the one hand, or, on the other, that we should not exploit our own provisions, such as reciprocity, to demonstrate a firmer stance. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologise to the Commissioner – my dear friend. So, now is the time to give some practical responses to the Arab Spring. Europe has followed what has been happening on the opposite shore of the Mediterranean with enthusiasm. We have followed with enthusiasm, concern and a certain element of surprise what had happened and was happening during those months, and what is still happening with the difficult situations in Egypt, Libya especially, and of course Syria. Sometimes I – hesitantly – remember some of the statements by European foreign ministers who, not much more than a year ago, literally – and I remember this because it shows how far we have come – defined Gaddafi as an example of reformism for the rest of Africa, a statement made last February, and Syria as a country – and again I quote – capable of meeting its citizens’ need for modernity from its leadership. This is where we have come from. Another statement from February last year. In the end, however, with the support and empathy of Europe, the Arab Spring eventually emerged with difficulty, and it was a marvellous change. What has happened in the southern Mediterranean has been extraordinary, and is also a reason for great hope, but naturally there are a lot of difficulties ahead. What help can we give as Europeans? What can we do in practical terms to try and make these people taking steps towards democracy understand that economic development also offers prospects for a better life? We have two problems, among others. The first is that the potential for trade between the European Union and southern Mediterranean countries is definitely under-utilised. We are doing less than we could be doing. The report contains some figures, I will not quote them here, but given the geographical proximity and the fact that we all belong to a single area, Mediterranean Europe, the commercial policy figures are certainly rather unsatisfactory. The second problem is that traditionally we – especially the southern Mediterranean countries – have structured our trade relations in such a way that trade with Europe mainly benefited an elite, an oligarchy which often managed the flows from this trade in an extremely exclusive, if not selfish manner. The Arab Spring is trying to liberate political processes, and subsequently we also need to liberate the economy, in order to ensure that those who want to become producers and players in a global economic and commercial process in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Libya and the other countries really can do so, and can have a direct dialogue with Europe. This also means trying, also through a commercial policy, to provide practical help in a social situation that is sometimes desperate. In Egypt, revenues have fallen over 35% compared with during the Mubarak era. There is little investment, tourism is a resource that has almost run dry, and therefore we need new political tools, and here I think that in our work, we have proposed a series of practical elements to meet these expectations, and we will return to these in the final summary. Meanwhile, I would like to thank the Commission heartily for the constant support it has given me as well as the shadow rapporteurs. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to invite the Commission not to be too cautious, on the other hand, and, above all, I would like to invite the House not to be too fixated on the agricultural issue. We cannot carry on considering trade relations between the European Union and Mediterranean countries solely from the point of view of agriculture and, in fact, the report takes a totally different line. We asked for more connection with civil society, more study grants – and I would like to thank the Commissioner for what he said at the beginning on the development of the Erasmus Mundus
 programme – I believe – it is not an issue which concerns the DG Trade – but I believe that it would be useful also to have an Erasmus Med
, something specifically for the Mediterranean countries, as a written declaration from Parliament had, in fact, requested. We are calling for bilateral chambers of commerce between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries which do not yet exist. We are calling for new credit instruments, something – also through the work we have done with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) – is starting to happen, also for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and we are especially calling for liberalisation of this trade through the possibility of allowing new players and entities, like SMEs in fact, to emerge in southern Mediterranean countries. There is an extraordinary amount of talent in this area in the Arab countries that has always been suppressed by the oligarchies in power. In this sense, technical cooperation to dismantle non-tariff barriers – all elements of our report – is crucial. Let us not miss this opportunity. We have the opportunity to use commercial policy, the exclusive competence of the European Union, to do a truly political job, part of which has still not been done, in order to support these processes. There are those who say that nothing has happened, that there have been no Arab Springs. I challenge anyone in this House eighteen months ago to imagine that Mubarak, Ben Ali and Gaddafi would have fallen from power in their countries in the space of a just a few months. Something has happened, and the development and outcome depend also on us, and also on commercial policy instruments, and I must just briefly say a word about the contribution of our Green friends who have just left us: do not have an ideological approach. It is not true that commerce is not good for development, quite the opposite. The report demonstrates all the rest. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, after so much good news from Africa, what a lot of nasty surprises in Mali, a country which has even practised democracy successfully in recent years: we have had hostage taking, threats of secession from the North, the coup d'état
, fundamentalist gangs applying Sharia law, and the risk of famine; five problems, each of which is a human tragedy that is hard to resolve and, apart from anything else, these five problems are capable of contaminating the entire region. Mali is a collateral victim, partly of the conflict that took place in Libya, and finds itself caught up in an issue that is bigger than itself, bigger than the Malian political class. The real reasons have their origins outside its borders as well as in issues related to the conflict in Libya and, as has been said, even further afield. When, in our resolution, we call for a post-Gaddafi strategy for the entire region, we want political and security cooperation to be much more thorough, to go beyond contacts, and, in conjunction with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union and the United Nations in their respective roles, both food security and political security can be guaranteed, knowing that the later you intervene, the harder it is to find a solution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the many misadventures of Nigeria include the deaths of Franco Lamolinara and Chris McManus, two European citizens who were killed during the failed attempt to free them. This was a very sad episode not only because of their deaths, but also because of the way the operation was coordinated between the countries involved, and for the apparent absence of any European involvement dear Commissioner. Italy has complained about the lack of information about what was about to happen – and this is already one issue – but I must say to the Commissioner that the citizens of Europe need a visible face of our shared foreign policy that is able to face its responsibilities on behalf of Member States, especially where there is little coordination, as was the case in Nigeria. Today, many people are licking their wounds, the Italians who were unable to be part of the liberation plan, the British for a failed operation and Europe for having kept a low profile. We condemn terrorism, which is also a phenomenon totally alien to African culture, and call on Nigeria to do its utmost, but we must also learn what the EU’s responsibilities are, and quickly, if we want to be taken seriously by Europe’s citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the blessed sweetness of its finished product, the cocoa market has been practically cursed from the very start. When Francesco Carletti, a Florentine trader who was the first to circumnavigate the Earth using merchant ships between the late 1500s and early 1600s, brought cocoa to Europe, he denounced a business in which the main financing for investments in this plant was derived from the slave trade. Ever since then, the inhumane nature of the cocoa trade has persisted. If the product comes from Ghana or Côte d’Ivoire – which account for almost 60% of global output – then the use of children is a given, the majority of whom are less than 14 years old and often subject to genuine trafficking, which sees them taken away from their families in nearby countries and shut away in the plantations. Last week, I was in Côte d’Ivoire for an annual meeting of Euro-African liberal democrat members of parliament. There, I met the President of the main non-governmental organisation (NGO) that fights against the exploitation of children in cocoa plantations. The organisation is not without support, since even the wife of President Ouattara has come to its aid, opening the national surveillance committee against child exploitation and labour. That said, we need to move away from depending on volunteers, good examples and harsh words, and instead imbue the markets with a sense of social responsibility that has so far been lacking in the cocoa plantations, with their distinctive non-intensive, non-mechanical culture, and the aggravating factor of the use of pesticides that are harmful to workers. The agreement that has been signed – for which I should like to thank Mr Moreira and the Commission – is a step in the right direction, making the chocolate supply chain more transparent, involving NGOs and promoting fairer prices around the world. Since the EU controls most of the votes of importer countries in international cocoa organisations, it has a special responsibility to put the agreement quickly into action and use it as a way to make the production of this popular treat more humane. As significant as it is, however, this agreement alone will not suffice. We also need consumers to be more aware so that they can make ethical purchases, while also promoting the production and sale of fair trade chocolate, which guarantees prices for producers and that no children were exploited in the plantations of Africa during the process. The EU can do much more in this area, including by setting out regulations on (European) certification that has so far been a private initiative. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Menéndez del Valle, who I congratulate, is a very important document as part of the effort we are making, in the Committee on International Trade and in Parliament as a whole, to define new rules and provide a different impetus for trade in the Mediterranean. It is an essential task and one of the great challenges – taking advantage of the exclusive jurisdiction of the European Union on matters of international trade – to provide solutions to those countries that still today have vast untapped potential in terms of trade policy with us. It is not only a matter of bringing about greater stability and prosperity, but also of expanding the social and production base among those who may benefit from the trade policy. In my view, this convention should have three important effects: firstly, promoting South-South trade, now almost at a minimum in the Mediterranean; secondly, promoting market access for small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to operate what I call – as the rapporteur for another measure – ‘Trade for Change’, in other words, trade measures for countries undergoing democratisation in the southern Mediterranean – liberating economic and commercial processes in countries where the few oligarchies in power have centralised the proceeds from trade into their own hands; and finally, making this trade more readily understandable through simple rules. The problem of Israel must also be addressed because otherwise, the credibility of Parliament is at stake. This is an important work: we often wonder why we have only now managed to simplify the 100 plus different regulations governing rules of origin. It is now important for everyone to ratify it as soon as possible. What is happening with regard to the ratification of the mandate of the European Investment Bank for the Mediterranean is not very encouraging, given that Member States are proceeding very slowly. We hope that there will not be the same delay for the convention. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, to be perhaps a little provocative, we could have opened this sitting with a minute’s silence in memory of the more than 600 homeless people who have died this week from the cold. This is the tribute that we generally reserve for great and famous people. That would have represented an assumption of responsibility – perhaps the first by this Parliament – of great symbolic significance. In fact, what we are witnessing is that the instruments of participatory democracy for the defence of rights provided by the Union are incapable of being applied to the homeless, whether or not they are citizens of the European Union, and this is because, I am afraid, there is often no electoral consensus for this. The Vice-President, Mr Barnier, is quite right to remind us that this is a matter within the competence, above all, of the Member States. However, we are dealing here with a phenomenon that is ever more European, cross-border and visible. We therefore ask: what is the timetable for the strategy that we have demanded from the Commission on a number of occasions? How much – aside from the Progress programme – can be allocated from European funds, including the structural and social cohesion funds? We ask in addition: is free movement for the homeless genuinely guaranteed, or is it possible for a Member State to impose restrictions, precisely because these citizens –European citizens – may not have a fixed place of abode at their disposal? Finally, are basic support services guaranteed? Some Member States have refused this to citizens of other Member States, citing European regulations. Are we sure that this is legally admissible? In conclusion, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has established that every European citizen wastes 179 kilograms of food per year. What European strategy should we adopt to combat this waste? I consider that this is an economic and social issue but above all one of the identity of our own European Union. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the most visible aspect of the changes affecting Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (the BRICS), which is also the most significant one in terms of consequences for the life of our societies, regards the economic and commercial penetration of these emerging powers. These changes may lead to stability and widespread prosperity, but appropriate speed is required, both in terms of responses in the international rules – and we know that unfortunately the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations are at a standstill – and in terms of greater integration of our foreign policy with trade policy, taking into account the fact that our foreign policy in some respects is unfortunately still in its infancy, while trade policy, thanks to the exclusive competences of the Treaty of Lisbon, is fully functional. I am wondering, for example, what the role of trade attachés in our embassies is. These trade attachés are not part of the European External Action Service, but will play a key role in the BRICS countries, one that is as important, if not more so, as that of our diplomats.

 Mr President, I am honoured to have been the promoter of this plenary debate. I believe that European prisons suffer from at least two problems. The first is that it is quite difficult to have the instruments of European democracy enter these institutions. In prisons, there are human rights abuses and people’s dignity is mortified, as concerns both detainees and those who work in the prisons, such as the warders. Prisons are overcrowded, a sign of lack of investment: people are crowded in together and the door is shut. There is little knowledge of prison regulations, while copies of them should be distributed and clearly understood by all. There is abdication of the principal role of re-education that prisons should play, not least because employment for detainees is no longer facilitated inside prisons. There is little transparency and hardly any opening to citizens, schools and non-governmental organisations. Budget cuts threaten essential services and the training of personnel and there is an overall lack of interest by the media and politicians. I now go on to the second point. Personally, as part of the initiative that Marco Pannella launched in Italy, for the past three years, I have visited two prisons on 15 August – the day that is most symbolic of holidays – and I have been struck by the absence of the European dimension within them. There are no exchanges of good practices, and few are the moments of contact between the staff and operators from the various European countries. I therefore applaud the publication of this Green Paper, which may cast light on a series of issues: how to improve mutual trust and, naturally, detention conditions; how to associate detention conditions with European regulations on preventive detention, the European arrest warrant, the conditions of minors, the power to inspect, the right to visits by families and all the activities of cultural mediators, which are necessary. The Council is present today and many answers depend on it. We are dealing with a test of civilisation, that is, of European identity. Prisons will always be prisons. I do not believe that the solution lies in emptying them, but they must cease to be those dark corners of rights and European responsibilities. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, I shall begin with a poem by an Uzbek poet, Jogdor Obid (I translate from the English): ‘Little hands, little slaves dream of warm and sunny days, but suffer from coughs and tremble as they walk. Little hands and little slaves, children’s thoughts, dreams of tenderness, but it all ends up dead and buried’. This is the testimony of Jogdor Obid, describing cotton-picking by children in Uzbekistan. This took place in the period of the Soviet Union. Some things have changed, others have not. For example, the power structure has not changed: the Uzbek President today is the same one who, in 1991, was at the head of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Uzbekistan. Other things have changed: the situation of children in the cotton fields is worse, much worse. In other interviews, Jogdor Obid speaks of seven-year-olds who are slaves, being bought and sold in Uzbekistan to harvest cotton. This is an intolerable situation: our demands are the same as those already mentioned: access for International Labour Organisation (ILO) inspectors; for Uzbekistan to act in accordance with the values of human rights, which are, in fact, included in the country’s constitution; for the Commission to propose a traceability mechanism for the cotton harvested, free from the trade in children and their condition as slaves; again for the Commission, also on the basis of the ILO findings, possibly to decide the suspension of the Generalised System of Privileges (GSP) for Uzbekistan. We have done this with the Sri Lanka GSP+, and we could think of doing the same with Uzbekistan. Naturally, there will be no agreement on this protocol by the European Parliament, which can rely on its new Lisbon powers; at stake are the ever-stricter values of the European Union, not least as concerns our international trade policy.

 Mr President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, just yesterday the Italian statistics office reported that the figure for tax evasion in Italy in 2008 was between 16% and 17% of GDP, which comes to between EUR 255 billion and EUR 275 billion. With such figures there will never be any control of the deficit. In its annual report the Italian Court of Audit spoke of the cost of corruption for 2009 at EUR 60 billion, adding that we will never have any kind of growth. The income gap is widening, and we therefore have no social cohesion. I believe it is imperative for the EU to update its convergence criteria, also adding parameters relating to good governance and social equality. I should say that the verification carried out by the Commission on the tax shield of the last Italian government, that from our point of view violated a large part of the European standards on money laundering, competition and tax evasion – as well as on VAT evasion which, following our appeal, was proven to be correct – demonstrates lack of attention on the part of these institutions regarding an approach that should be fair and global.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s call to tighten up its budget brings a moment of truth for countries who have squandered and badly managed their own resources. However, it should also be a moment of truth for Europe with regard to growing social exclusion, and the need to denounce and resolve it. It is enough to read the Caritas reports and speak to volunteers committed to tackling urban poverty to understand the extent of the phenomenon which now affects even those who never thought they would find themselves in a soup kitchen or a hostel. It is enough to look around. A few weeks ago in Paris, in Place de la Bastille, I saw a homeless couple sleeping rough, with a new-born baby between them. There were others in Rue St-Antoine – so we are talking about a wealthy part of Paris – another couple on the ground, on cardboard boxes, with two children under the covers as well. I stopped to look at the reactions of passers-by and, over the course of 15 minutes, no one even stopped to look. The indifference of a large portion of our citizens is another face of this emergency. Last year, I spent a night in Rome with Emmaus volunteers. I learnt a lot, but I also discovered that they were scandalously alone. With this report, which the Italy of Values will support, we ask that a problem which we often prefer to ignore is not forgotten. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank the rapporteur, Mr Kósa, who has been as tireless as ever. This report begins by citing 40 or so official reference documents, including United Nations conventions, communications from the European Parliament and the Commission, resolutions, green papers and miscellaneous acts, which makes one realise just how much work has been carried out over the years on legislation, regulations, guidelines and recommendations in the field of disability. Moreover, this report puts forward a long list of objectives to further the inclusion of our fellow citizens with disabilities. I would like to mention two of these objectives in particular. The first is the participation of people with disabilities in the decision-making process, based on the principle of ‘nothing about us without us’. The second objective is to regard this subject as a human and civil rights issue, in other words, not an issue about a single group of people, but one that touches on the very identity of the European Union. The reality in Europe is very different, however, Mr President, because sadly, we are witnessing an increase in the suffering and pain of people with disabilities in our countries. We see structural funds that should be available but are shamefully left unused by Member States or local authorities, and we see infringements by these same Member States or local authorities that are not punished as they should be by the Commission. We see good practice in some countries, but unfortunately, it is ignored and not exported or valued elsewhere, and we see treatment that varies from one country to another or from one region to another within the same country, which limits considerably the freedom of movement of our fellow citizens with disabilities.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we could hear a small businessman or woman speak in this Chamber today, we would hear a story that is even more worrying than the details we have been given, especially because of the four structural problems facing this sector, which is a crucial sector and an integral part of Europe’s identity. The four problems are help for internationalisation, reducing red tape – we have heard about the hurdles that have to be overcome just to pay VAT in the various countries – innovation and access to the Structural Funds, which some Member States are not using as they should, and access to credit. Commissioner, it is unacceptable that Europe should recapitalise the banks without imposing strict conditions to make them facilitate access to credit for such a crucial sector of the European economy as small and medium-sized enterprises, which are now not being rewarded but held to ransom, if not crippled, by the credit institutions.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, we received a delegation of citizens who described themselves as ‘indignant’. Some have come a long way to get to Brussels, even travelling by foot from Iceland. Being indignant is the exact opposite of cynicism, indifference and resignation. It is a non-violent, transparent way of asking for the current European crisis to be tackled, rewarding the European institutions for being assertive and playing a leading role rather than being at the mercy of national governments, but, above all, it is a way of tackling this crisis with tools involving the real participation of the people. The European Union will have to take difficult, even unpopular decisions. Yesterday’s meeting was short but significant, because it showed that we need to exploit this crisis in order to rebel against the tribal fragmentation of Europe, which prevents it from having a shared vision, but, above all, it showed that we need to involve citizens fully in processes from which, to date, they have felt excluded.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support and thank the rapporteur for the outstanding work she has accomplished in committee, sometimes in circumstances that can hardly be described as relaxed. Trade between the European Union and the Palestinian Authority is minimal. We are certainly a long way from achieving the full potential of this relationship, and who knows when we will also be able to implement the sections relating to fishing, considering the dual illegality the Gaza Strip is subject to: the illegality of the blockade by the Israelis and the illegality of the control exercised by Hamas over the Strip. However, we are finally taking full responsibility for our relations, we are making international trade a fully-fledged instrument of foreign policy and above all we recognise the Palestinian Authority as a negotiating partner with full rights. Paradoxically we are doing this while at the same time, at the UN headquarters in New York, we are dragging our feet on the question of recognising its independence. Let us now hope for rapid implementation with good will shown by all sides. This should include ensuring we do not grant the products of the Jewish colonies any kind of special trade privileges, either as products declared as Israeli or as Palestinian products.

on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree to a large extent with my fellow Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). There is a degree of hypocrisy and also one of hesitation in what the Commissioner told us. In the 2010 communication, a paradox emerged in that the word Taiwan can neither be written nor spoken. Yet, it is a small China; very democratic and extremely vital both from a trade point of view and in terms of technological innovation. There is a very real principle which we must adhere to, especially in our trade undertakings. Taiwan exists and it exists de facto as a Sovereign State; Taiwan is a full member of the World Trade Organisation; we have excellent trade links with Taiwan and it is negotiating or will negotiate free trade agreements with several third countries. Something else is also true, which is that China, the People’s Republic of China, always responds with much irritation to our contact with Taiwan, nevertheless we do get the impression that it would be able to adapt with a certain level of pragmatism to a next step. Therefore we return to the original question, which we have still not had a compelling response to: is a free trade agreement possible with Taiwan, even at a lower or sectoral level? I think that this Parliament would be ready to support the Commission in such an undertaking. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Minister, Mr Nicolai, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that there are three things we can be sure of. The first is our deep friendship with the Palestinian people, a people that is suffering, that suffers every day. One has to visit the occupied territories to see the daily suffering of the Palestinian people, and this is a people to whom the international community owes a debt. The second certainty is the tie that binds us to Israel as Europeans, a tie that is probably stronger than that with any other country outside the EU, because Israel is an indispensable part of Europe’s cultural and moral identity; it is part of our family. The third certainty, unfortunately, is that Europe is always divided or highly conservative in its positions. These limitations are clear also in this vote at the United Nations, which will probably be another mortifying occasion after the absence of any European policy to speak of in the Libyan crisis, and yet it is only up to us, Minister, Commissioner. European citizens are finally asking for a qualitative leap, a position from Europe as a whole and, if possible, I hope there will be a position in support of the declaration of independence, as many Israelis too are asking, contrary to their government, and as Palestinians are asking from a basic sense of justice. Support for independence would first of all be in line with the reality of the Palestine that there is, that exists despite everything, and that no one can cancel from the maps. Its identity paradoxically grows stronger in the national sentiment with every day that passes, thanks to the occupation. In second place the security and the very identity of Israel would be strengthened. This security and identity are guaranteed more by the existence of two separate States with clear borders than by the prospect – and this is something we should ask the Israeli leaders in 20 years’ time – of a single State shared by Palestinians and Israelis. Finally, this declaration of independence would be a break with the stagnant waters of European diplomacy and the negotiations that are going nowhere. If we fail to embrace this break then we are condemning ourselves, after the financial crisis, to remaining on the sidelines also of international diplomacy. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I recall meeting an Italian entrepreneur a few years ago in Uzbekistan. He was trying – successfully – to tie up some contracts to sell the shoes that he made in what was not much more than a workshop, without knowing Russian or much less Uzbek, yet he managed it. This is a slightly unusual example because, in the end, while the European Union is a major international economy, on the one hand, on the other, 90% of our revenue is created by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), of which only 15% export to outside the European Union and only 30% trade outside their own country. Essentially, we are faced with a contradiction that reveals a profound vulnerability. The very concept of an SME necessarily implies the ability to be reactive and flexible – as shown by this Italian entrepreneur in Uzbekistan – and these skills also apply to internationalisation. However, this potential is largely wasted. We do not use the opportunities presented by the markets, by consumer goods and by the new lightweight technologies that we could use in public tenders – though in that situation with a certain wariness, because I think the public procurement sector is still the most difficult for SMEs hoping to internationalise. Unfortunately, the tools available to SMEs are obviously not suited to their needs, which is the very reason behind this debate. There are too many instruments and too much bureaucracy involved in using them, as well as a lack of multilingual skills available to SMEs – which is a significant obstacle – and insufficient training and information. That is why we are asking the Commission for a thorough revision of the measures to assist in the internationalisation of SMEs, as well as for a precise target. Let us set ourselves an objective along the lines of doubling the rate of internationalisation among SMEs in 10 years – something we can use as a yardstick for the new policies. That said, we also call on SMEs, because internationalisation – quite aside from all the objective difficulties and hitherto inadequate instruments – is also a question of culture, mindset, openness and keeping up with the times. The survival of SMEs, millions of jobs and the identity of our Union are at stake. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to return to the previous point, namely Prime Minister Berlusconi’s visit to this institution, because, as we have learnt, it is already the subject of jibes and ridicule. I should just like to know, Mr President – in the light of your explanation that there has been no official request for a meeting and that there will be no official visit by the Italian Prime Minister to the European Parliament – whether you will be meeting him and what the status of that meeting would be, tomorrow, during a visit which, I can assure you, most members of the public in our country regard as something of a mockery, given that the Prime Minister was due to appear in court in Naples tomorrow.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is in favour of this request; many things have happened in the Mediterranean this year, and I think that the events in Libya over the last few weeks deserve our attention. We cannot postpone the vote until such time as Colonel Gaddafi is captured, if he is captured – because this could happen soon, or it could take a long time. It is clear that the Libyan situation is an ongoing crisis. Europe has not always spoken with one voice in recent months on Libya; at times it has even been weak, and I believe that, with a vote, with an official pronouncement from Parliament, we can make a decisive contribution.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a debate that fails to inspire much of a reaction among people. The issue of the Doha negotiations is far removed from most citizens, the media, and even many governments, which are now busy dealing with far more pressing financial and economic priorities. This is not a debate that truly excites Brussels, nor even, it seems to me, Geneva, at least not from what I have seen this year, both in the WTO Parliamentary Assembly and in its steering committee, of which I am a member. There is an air of resignation about the fact that nothing is happening now, that nothing must happen, that nothing can happen, that the challenges facing a better-regulated and more generous global market are too complicated, and that the boundaries between the opposing blocs – between emerging countries that regard themselves today as powers and the former powers of old, which are now struggling, countries in constant transition, with an identity crisis – are themselves always shifting and vague. In other words, the ship that the World Trade Organisation – and, therefore, we too – are aboard does not know where it is heading, because, as Seneca wrote, ‘If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favourable.’ In the meantime, Commissioner, the poorest countries are losing out: they were encouraged to comply with international trade rules, and a good 32 out of 48 of them have joined the WTO, but what good has it done them so far? Theirs is a paradoxical situation: they account for less than 1% of international trade, but have 12% of the world’s population, people who are often forced to live without access to basic services. The forthcoming Eighth WTO Ministerial Conference has a duty to adopt at least – I repeat, at least – a package of measures to help them, and yet we have received no guarantees on that score – anything but. We call on you, Commissioner, to look into this matter. Although it would have no significant impact on international trade balances, the poorest countries would benefit greatly from measures such as the introduction of duty-free access quotas for their products, the simplification of rules of origin, the introduction of measures to correct market distortions in sectors such as the cotton sector, the provision of technical assistance to internationalise their economies and – an extremely important requirement for us members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – the extension of the TRIPS waiver beyond 2016 for pharmaceutical products and data protection. As far as we understand, none of this has been agreed yet. I understand your disappointment, Commissioner – we are disappointed too. We support you and the Commission in your commendable efforts. If there is no prospect of meeting the needs of the poorest countries, then we can well imagine the situation regarding much more complex issues, such as the balance between emerging countries, the European Union and the United States. If I am not mistaken, Pascal Lamy today inaugurated work on the construction of the WTO’s new headquarters in Geneva: this is a first step, and I must say that the need for proactive and industrious efforts to revive the work programme, objectives and the identity of international trade itself has never been so great.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this modification of the Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament we have an opportunity to uphold two principles, namely the transnational list, so that we have something more than an embryo at last, and a genuine step in the direction of European federalism, and we in the Italia dei valori 
party welcome the rapporteur’s tenacity in this regard. However, it is a mistake to think that the transnational list alone will reawaken the interest of the citizens, half of whom already fail to vote in European elections. We need innovative quality indicators that are in touch with society. We in the Italia dei valori
 party have proposed in committee to set a ceiling on MEPs’ mandates, in order to change those in office and create a process of renewal. This amendment was rejected – on rather ridiculous grounds, in my view – by MEPs instinctively seeking to protect themselves and their position. We are committed to making other changes for the next part-session: the first change concerns the regional dimension of elected representatives and constitutions – of MEPs – to ensure that they have a strong relationship with their home region, and the second change will be made both through the amendment tabled jointly with the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament – and I am grateful to Mr Gualtieri – and with a separate text aimed at ensuring a ‘clean Parliament’, as requested by the public. A ‘clean Parliament’ that prevents people who have received definitive sentences – and thus obtained all the guarantees of a fair trial – for extremely serious offences such as terrorism, corruption, organised crime, incitement to racial hatred, and so on from standing in elections. It is a disgrace that those guilty of such crimes should be able to sit in this House today. More courage is needed, ladies and gentlemen, and it is only with pioneering European rules that the European Parliament will obtain all the credibility it deserves. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the impression is that we are having difficulty bringing together all the possible instruments and making even small but tangible gestures. We have: political dialogue, trade policy, development coordination, immigration policies and humanitarian aid with separate managers, procedures and budget lines and sometimes Europe picks a card and uses the policy it likes the most, but we need to pursue every option to help whoever is most deserving and to update all the instruments. For example, trade with Egypt and Tunisia cannot continue with the same agreements for other countries in the region. A Mediterranean development bank is needed or, alternatively, the mandate of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could be extended, just as the European Investment Bank can finance small enterprises in Moldova or in Ukraine, but not in Egypt. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe reach the Caucasus and Central Asia, but there is no Mediterranean integration cooperation organisation. What initiatives do we intend to adopt in this direction? Is Parliament currently asking for a specific Erasmus programme for the Mediterranean and why is the Commission not rolling out this initiative immediately? An Arab employee of a multinational can obtain a visa for Europe, but a small Tunisian entrepreneur who wants to sign a contract cannot. High Representative, it is up to you not to waste any initiative and to consistently bring together all our actions from the many European Union bodies, otherwise, the change will take over and inspire the Mediterranean, but it will not have inspired us.

 Madam President, in addition to the opening of a delegation in Ulaanbaatar – something that we can no longer put off, not least because pursuing relations from Beijing is very bad for symbolic reasons – and in addition to the long-awaited partnership agreement, we are all aware both of the country’s mineral wealth and of its weaknesses in terms of social justice, even though Mongolia has, in its own way, developed a form of democratic cohesion. I would especially like to ask the Commission where Mongolia should be placed from a geostrategic point of view: it is not a country covered by the Central Asia strategy. I think, however, that some of the measures in this strategy could perhaps be extended to Mongolia, in view of its cultural history, which is similar to that of the other countries. The country also currently has observer status in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the European Union is examining the possibility of helping it become a full member, given the ancient cultural links that exist between Europe and Mongolia.

Madam President, it is difficult to oversee the final steps in the formation of a new country along a peaceful path. The ultimate objective – peace – must be safeguarded, but without losing significant pieces of the global agreement. Khartoum’s military action in Abyei appears to be jeopardising the good overall outcome of this journey, though not the founding of the 54th African state on 9 July. The South must not react to provocation and not lose sight of the final objective, which is not only independence but also the constitution of credible institutions and the advancement of its population, 90% of which lives below the poverty line. The people are unlikely to benefit from foreign investment, which already promises to be transparent and not predatory. I believe that this – the problem of foreign investment in South Sudan – will soon be a new front line that the European Union must monitor and on which it must assert the credibility it has earned in recent years in this region.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is something wrong about holding a debate in May 2011 on a natural disaster that occurred in summer 2010, a disaster that left 12 million people homeless and destroyed 20% of the country concerned. I do not support the socialist position, which was expressed by Mr Susta just now. It is partly due to this hesitation that we are still racking our brains trying to work out which instruments we can adopt in order to actively help Pakistan, and on top of our frustration at not having achieved that yet, we are also conscious that we need a trade policy approach that is more mature in political and humanitarian terms: trade policy must become one of the instruments for helping populations in difficulty. I admit that the Commission has acted swiftly and effectively by proposing a package of measures, which obviously needed to be discussed and rebalanced so that they did not penalise a European sector that has already been tested by the crisis. It is thanks to the work done by the Committee on International Trade, including that contained in certain amendments – among which the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports Amendment 37 – that businesses, too, can request application of the safeguard clause. However, it seems that these are bad times for Pakistan and that too many people are failing to face up to their responsibilities. We are asking India to change its attitude and to soften its ‘no’ stance at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as a tangible sign of good-neighbourly relations. True, relations are difficult between those two countries, since there was also the Mumbai attack and Pakistan’s poor cooperation in identifying and capturing the perpetrators of the attack. Yet that affair could be something that breaks the bad habits of a bad relationship between neighbours. We are also asking the Pakistani authorities for something, namely, to be more determined to consider this issue from a bilateral point of view in their relations with India. Bilateral meetings have recently taken place, though little has come of them, perhaps due to a pride issue on the Pakistanis’ part. It is clear that cricket diplomacy, emphasised by Pakistan’s Members of Parliament, whom we met just two weeks ago, has so far failed to produce meaningful results. Lastly, it is the WTO, above all, that we are asking – as we did in Geneva during the recent Interparliamentary Assembly – quickly to adopt mechanisms that will enable international trade rules to respond swiftly and flexibly to emergencies in a country hit by unforeseen disasters. This tariff reduction affair may end up achieving nothing, or it could open a new era in trade relations. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these negotiations are a little like the four-armed God Shiva, since it takes so much effort to conclude such a complex agreement. I am now going to explain the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Firstly: access to medicines. While I welcome the Commissioner’s statement, I confirm that I am against any attempt to implement protectionist measures in a sector in which Europe actually hindered access to low cost medicines in the past. Exploiting the issue of counterfeiting purely for protectionist purposes is about as low as it gets. The agreement should instead be an opportunity for the Indian and European pharmaceutical industries to cooperate with one another. Secondly: industrial sectors. We are asking India to allow sensitive sectors such as the automotive and alcohol sectors, in which our exports are today heavily taxed, to also feature in the agreement. Thirdly: agriculture. For our part, we declare ourselves willing to discuss agricultural products and to open up our market, but with a few conditions attached: obviously, we must say ‘no’ to GMOs and do everything we can to protect geographical indications. As regards this last aspect, I would remind you that geographical indications are not just a trade policy matter; they are also part of Europe’s identity. We therefore hope that a huge effort will be made to simplify registration procedures in India’s bureaucratic system, which is very onerous, perhaps even more onerous than the European one, which says it all. As regards public procurement, I congratulate the Commission if it is true that India seems to be prepared, for the first time, to include public procurement in an international agreement. Indian railways – to give you an example, 17 000 trains transport 18 million passengers every day, and there are plans to build a further 25 000 kilometres of track in the next 10 years – are one of the many markets that could potentially be opened up with this free trade agreement. If the negotiations go well, both parties will benefit: sustainable development will be promoted, child labour will gradually be eradicated and a more progressive form of social protection will be upheld. I feel it is pointless and detrimental to oppose this, and so I call on all the groups in Parliament to reject a priori
 a compromise text. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Schlyter for his excellent report on a sensitive issue on which a great deal of common sense is needed. Not all investment agreements can be replaced by European agreements, but not even the Commission can ignore agreements that infringe European provisions, and we agree with the rapporteur about placing the emphasis on transparency. Ideally, we should have a clause that automatically repeals the 1 200 agreements currently in force. Unfortunately, however, that would mean legal uncertainty for investors and too much work, perhaps, for the Commission. Our amendments in the Committee on International Trade have been successful, firstly, in ensuring that the Commission’s powers are fully respected and, secondly, in stating that legal certainty should be guaranteed. Some of the amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow in plenary may now alter this compromise and balance, and I call on my fellow Members, and the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs in particular, to come up with a balanced measure that is acceptable to all. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for time immemorial, if there is one trade that is difficult to control, it is the arms trade. There are various ways to make this control difficult. One is to trade in apparently harmless weapons or techniques that can easily become a weapon, and that is why we are concerned with dual use in the regulation. Another difficulty is the plethora of rules that make any control system ineffective. When we started working on this case, the Commission asked us to amend a regulation dating from 2000. Meanwhile, this has been revoked and we were called on to amend the more recent 2009 regulation on the basis of the same obsolete proposal. We have just entered trialogue and we already have a new legislative proposal from the Commission, again to amend the regulation. The first request is therefore to establish clear, simple and transparent rules for European exporters having a consolidated text. Four points on the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). With regard to shipments of low value, we in the ALDE concur with the Council in being very sceptical about this system. Parliament has already limited the maximum value from EUR 5 000 to 3 000 and imposed various other criteria. The list of destination countries is very limited. This is something that small and medium-sized businesses legitimately want, but our main message is that we want security above all, as well as trade, and we must go back to work on this in the trialogue. We support the policy of ex ante notification and the obligation of registration by Member States. Finally, we demand the maximum degree of transparency to ensure that the regulation provides a mechanism which informs stakeholders, such as human rights or peace monitoring and trade unions organisations, of the various stages that made up the decision-making process, including through a report to the European Parliament Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Generalised System of Preferences is one of the few methods of differentiation that works in favour of developing countries in international trade. It is a delicate instrument that must be used in the best way. Tonight we are talking about an extension, which means that the Commission date will be postponed once the new final proposal has been submitted. In the meantime, however, we are saying that this is a tool to be handled with caution, and that also applies to inter-institutional relations. Until now, even on the basis of the pre-Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament has not always been fully involved in decisions, as happened at the time of the discussions on Colombia or Sri Lanka that fired the enthusiasm of this House. We must also consider the merits of an ex-post
 evaluation of the decision to implement the regulation. What is the impact of the effects of a tariff reduction, what about its suspension, what are its mechanisms, what is its procedure? Sometimes an on-the-spot examination of these issues may reveal surprises and suggest the most relevant criteria to make the impact of the regulation as effective as possible. As far as the conditions are concerned, the world is changing and the instrument must show greater compliance with regard to those countries rewarded by the tariff concessions. The main concept of respect for human rights must be complemented by a broader vision in which, as noted by the rapporteur Mr Scholz – whom I thank for the excellent work he has done in this report – various indicators are taken into consideration: post-conflict rehabilitation, the specific situation of women, trade unions, the situation of recovery after natural disasters, environmental sustainability and compliance with international social agreements. If we were to adopt a combination of these criteria, I would not be surprised if the list of beneficiary countries we came up with were different from the current list and perhaps more deserving, but we will be able to talk about this again once we have the final proposal for a regulation.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you have already provided some information, Commissioner, but I would like more details. Firstly, the WTO. What exactly are we doing at the WTO concerning the initiative that was already taken in 2009 but which, as far as I know, concerned magnesium and bauxite? Do we have a procedure at the WTO regarding rare earths? Is such a procedure possible and do we initiate it alone, or can we initiate it together with the United States and Japan, as I think would be desirable? Secondly, you have said that we need to increase supplies from other deposits, including European ones. Is there a role for Greenland? What is the precise thinking in this respect? Thirdly, the recovery of rare earths from recycling. Are we moving towards a set of European rules on so-called urban mining? Will there be a directive or a regulation? What is planned in this respect? Fourthly, with regard to studies and investigation, the development of investigations, will we have some specific provisions in the Eighth Framework Programme also? Furthermore, with regard to the stockpiling system, will we have common European rules on stockpiling in this case, too? Finally, to what extent is the issue being dealt with bilaterally with China as part of the high-level economic and commercial dialogue and in the negotiations under way on the new partnership and cooperation agreement with that country? Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, this agreement contains a clause that does not convince us and has never convinced us. I am talking about the refund of customs duties that Korea will receive for imports of products from China or other countries. We have already discussed this, but as a liberal democrat I consider this measure to be deeply flawed. It is a kind of export subsidy, and I would like it if, when voting on this agreement, we had an assurance that this clause will not set a precedent and will not be included in any other future agreements. Tomorrow’s vote will conclude one leg of the journey we have undertaken together, but only one leg, because the relationship between Parliament and the Commission must continue, not least with regard to the actual implementation of the safeguard clause. For the sake of European industry and European workers, we cannot make any mistakes when implementing it, or else we will face great problems in future agreements. This is the Year of the Rabbit in the Far East, so I hope European industry will run like a rabbit, taking advantage of what this agreement can offer it. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start my speech with a statement supposedly made by the Italian Foreign Minister yesterday in Damascus, during which he said – listen to this – that Syria ‘is a stable country in which the population’s desire for modernisation has been satisfied’. Meanwhile, a few days ago, Italy’s Interior Minister made another statement in which he shifted his responsibilities to Europe, which has allegedly abandoned Italy ‘as usual’, he added with a hint of mischief. As usual, however, we are witnessing the habit of blaming Europe when it suits, only to ignore it irritably when Brussels disapproves of the agreement on sea repatriations, which violates humanitarian law and lines the pockets of African dictators – some of whom are today being toppled – and continuing even today to lavish billions on the Libya of Mr Gaddafi, or refusing EUR 10 million of aid offered to the Italian Government by the European Fund for Refugees, which Italy decided not to use, possibly because it would have to be spent in keeping with Europe’s transparent rules and not the in-house criteria of the Italian Civil Protection Agency. Therefore, I think that we will achieve nothing by acting like this and by making these declarations. The lesson of recent weeks has really not been learnt. Lampedusa reminds us that history is stronger than certain political games and recourse to declarations that create illusions. It reminds us that not everything can be bought with money, that Europe is not something that can be called upon when it suits, but is a project that must be committed to each day, demanding rights and solidarity but also respecting the commitments undertaken. In order to slow down migration in a sustainable and purposeful way, five things are needed: democracy, development, respect for international law, European solidarity and also, above all, no prejudicial rhetoric.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am a liberal democrat both in Europe and in Italy. Sometimes, however, in my country, my fellow party members and I are called communists merely for opposing the current government. It seems that the same thing is now happening to our colleagues in Bulgaria, with liberal democrats and socialists being called criminals simply because they represent an opposition force in their country. We disapprove of this move, because if it is a joke, then it really should only be a short one. Behaviour of this kind can become really dangerous in the end. In addition, after everything that has happened in Egypt and Tunisia, only yesterday, the Italian Foreign Minister visited Damascus in Syria and called it ‘a democratic country that completely satisfies its citizens’ need for modernisation’. If our representatives make speeches like this, it is our duty as Members of the European Parliament to denounce them and the Commission must keep a close watch. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I began working at the European Parliament as a political adviser in 1991 and at that time the conflict between northern and southern Sudan was already a recurring crisis. Finally, after 20 years, it seems we are seeing a bit of light at the end of a long, arduous tunnel. As Mr Milana and others have pointed out, much still needs to be done, but many of us were preparing for the worst and expecting the civil war to start up again. I therefore congratulate the north and south of the country on this initial referendum result. Every day counts now until the declaration of independence. No-one can allow themselves to put a foot wrong, either in Khartoum, in Juba, in Brussels or at the African Union in Addis Ababa. For example, the idea of opening an EU delegation with special status until the declaration of independence is definitely to be welcomed. Sudan is about to teach us,the international community, a wonderful lesson about cynicism and about crises that, more out of a sense of resignation than anything else, we often consider to be unsolvable.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the fate of Eastern Christians is changing the map of cultures, with communities thousands of years old – ‘Copt’ means ‘Egyptian’ in Greek – now looking to emigrate overseas to escape from the violence they have been suffering. However, the media or xenophobic parties should not make the mistake of calling this a clash of religions or a clash of civilisations. I would like to recount a short incident that I find significant. Years ago in Cairo, an old man from the countryside who delivered milk to our house three times a week stood at our door crying. We could not understand what he wanted, as all he could say through his tears was ‘Said Akbar
, Said Akbar
,’ the great old man, the great old man. We eventually realised that he was showing his Christian customers his grief at the death of Karol Wojtyła, who had just passed away. This was a simple, sincere man, a Muslim who acted with all the ancient mutual respect of the Mediterranean peoples. This short but significant incident, reflecting widespread values in Egyptian society, happened in the same country in which the Copts were massacred at Christmas. Today, however, Eastern Christian communities need protection. They are sometimes trapped in the settling of scores between terrorists and fundamentalists and authoritarian powers. European foreign policy should not remain powerless while the world changes. It should not be afraid to say the word ... (The President cut off the speaker) Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it really is true that Haiti is a case apart, that it is different, because anniversaries of disasters are always commemorated in order to remember the victims, to learn from one’s mistakes and do better next time, but it is different in Haiti because there is nothing to remember – nothing has happened yet. Instead of saying one year after
 the earthquake, we should actually be saying one year of
 earthquakes, because there was the seismic earthquake, then the earthquake with regard to the shambolic aid distribution, then the health earthquake with the cholera outbreak, then the political earthquake with the non-transparent elections that were held at probably the worst possible time, and now the earthquake that is, in some respects, historical too, with the return of the former dictator in the guise of a dubious multi-millionaire tourist. The Commission is doing good work – very good work, in fact. I visited Haiti last June with the Committee on Development and I saw the excellent work being done, for which we thank the Commission. However, there needs to be greater political protection and an enhanced role for the international community, which must set targets and deadlines and must directly oversee part of the reconstruction. This must be balanced with the increased involvement of the population and local NGOs, which are often frozen out instead. A lesser role for the national politicians and national government institutions of Haiti, then, and a greater role for the so far fragile partnership between its citizens and the international community.

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Côte d'Ivoire is a test case and a test case we cannot afford to fail. This applies to the European Union above all because there is no way we can acknowledge a stolen victory but neither is there any way we can stop exerting maximum pressure on the Ivorian leaders over this massive fraud. Furthermore, it will not be acceptable for a single euro from European taxpayers to end up in or even pass through an illegal government that disregards even the most elementary rules of democracy. Côte d'Ivoire must be made aware of this. Côte d'Ivoire is now also a test case for the African Union, which is dealing with the situation in a very interesting way, so far showing a degree of firmness and unity that would have been unthinkable only 10 or 15 years ago. This is a sign that the Ivorian affair should not be exploited to revive old stereotypes of black Africa being incompatible with democracy. Even though we hover on the brink of widespread violence, which would be catastrophic, Ivorian society is so far also passing this difficult test: it gave a majority to the reformist candidate Mr Outtara and appears to have learned the lesson of the great Ivorian writer Ahmadou Kourouma, who in 1998 published a book with the apt title ‘En attendant les votes des bêtes sauvages
’ (Waiting for the Wild Beasts to Vote), which tells this very story from a democratic and very Ivorian standpoint Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are only a few of us here this evening to talk about anti-dumping, which is, however, an issue we speak about a great deal in our own countries. I believe that there is no issue in international trade that business people, small and medium-sized enterprises, trade unions and consumers care more about than dumping. Dealing with dumping is basically a daily task for a large part of our productive economy. The Commission is working hard and is certainly doing its duty when it comes to anti-dumping initiatives, but we are calling for action based on the following principles. Firstly, transparency of action, full transparency of procedures, of the evaluation criteria adopted and their results, and then communications and a communications strategy, because the actions taken on anti-dumping by the European Commission can serve to reassure our business people and workers. Secondly, there is space for the exercise of discretion in anti-dumping procedures. This is common sense, but sometimes I have the impression that too much discretion is exercised in the decisions that are taken. Thirdly, following the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament must be better integrated, involved and informed. It seems to me that there the Commission is labouring somewhat to recognise Parliament’s role in international trade – even though much effort has been made, for which we are grateful to the Commissioner – and Parliament certainly needs to have a stronger voice on anti-dumping as well. Lastly, there is the question of dialogue with society. Once again, perhaps, the Commission still has much to do on this issue. Parliament cannot merely sit and listen to the players in society, including in anti-dumping matters. In this respect, the Commission should probably take note of the new requirements with respect to the exclusive powers on international trade recognised to it by the Treaty of Lisbon. Lastly, it is clear to us that anti-dumping must be part of a coherent commercial strategy and an integrated policy based on the criteria of honesty and openness. Bearing this in mind, Europe will be able to move forward with its head held high. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first the epicentre of a terrible earthquake, in precisely the poorest and worst-governed area in the American hemisphere, and now cholera in the country which receives one of the highest amounts of per capita international aid. What a contradiction! It is not just a terrible combination of bad luck: in Haiti, in the streets crowded with children and tents crammed in amongst the rubbish, no one knows where to begin. The local political class is often greedy and focused on power games rather than taking control of the reconstruction efforts, and the bureaucratic machine, decimated by the earthquake, has a weak administrative culture and, in some cases, has even obstructed the distribution of aid. There are many, often badly run, international organisations and, in fact, they have failed to protect the population. Visiting the country with the European Parliament delegation in June, the concentration of abandoned fields, rubble which had not been removed and rubbish already gave a clear indication of how bad the situation could become. Now cholera is here. The Commission and the Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) have so far done what was required, but they must now redouble their efforts. My feeling is that now, as well as strong recovery action, Haiti needs greater protection at the international political level. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today marks a fork in the road between two crucial principles. On the one hand, there is the duty of solidarity towards a country that has been hit by natural disasters, bringing its society, which already has structural problems, to its knees. On the other hand, there is the necessity for a balanced trade policy. With the European Commission’s proposal to suspend duties for Pakistan, the European Union is rightly avoiding a policy of mere humanitarian aid, allowing Pakistan to strengthen its economy and therefore its society. The fact that all 74 of the tariff lines involved relate to the textile and clothing sector is almost inevitable for a country that can export only products within this sector. We liberal democrats definitely prefer recourse to this kind of measure, rather than agreeing on humanitarian aid which is incapable of giving the country a genuine boost. However, as Mr Melo reiterated a short while ago, we must not be naive and we ask the Commission – above all – not to make the mistake of naivety. The Commissioner is well aware of the critical situation in which some textile districts, such as Prato, find themselves. Prato is a special case: The situation there has gone out of the control of the national authorities and there is widespread illegality, which is also exacerbated by the crisis in the European textiles sector. Since we believe that it cannot be just the European textiles sector that pays for our rightful humanitarian solidarity with Pakistan, we ask for three things to be done: 1) To set up regulatory instruments to avoid all possible triangulation with other countries that could profit from the duties from which Pakistan is benefiting; 2) Not to aggravate the crisis in the European textile sector, by implementing measures that could instead support it, such as a reduction in the cost of electricity; and 3) To avoid creating a precedent for other countries that suffer such natural disasters. By working in this way, I think the aid for Pakistan is shared and sustainable, including in the long term, and that is what that country needs. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Madam President, if you were to visit the Ponte Rialto
 in Venice – perhaps with Commissioner De Gucht – and wanted to buy a pair of shoes advertised as Italian, a tie, a traditional mask or a glass from Murano, there is a chance you will be ripped off, realising that the product purchased was not made in Italy at all, but in some country in Asia. I believe that the proposed regulation under discussion is beginning to inject some order into an ever more confused global market. It seeks to protect the consumer – including you Madam President, and Commissioner De Gucht, if you go shopping on Venice’s Ponte Rialto
, or elsewhere – as well as the European industries that have not relocated (whilst those that have will be penalised by this regulation). Above all it will correct the asymmetry on the trade markets, which sees Europe as the only large area lacking a regulation on compulsory origin marking. This is not a protectionist proposal; in fact, I find it to be very balanced. It only applies to a limited number of products, to the final product destined for the consumer, and – as far as my group is concerned – it is a 5-year pilot project because we shall support the amendment with the sunset clause. In addition, we also introduced in committee – through an amendment of my own – a provision that aims to avoid any excessive bureaucratic burden that would harm businesses. If the vote tomorrow is satisfactory, it will mean that one stage has been won, but it will not be a conclusive victory. We shall then need the full support of the European Commission in our dealings with the European Council. The Commission has already been full of suggestions and very cooperative, for which we are grateful, and this is a reason why we must continue to work together. I am sure that in five years, we shall be satisfied by the result we have obtained. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations have been difficult, with strong opposing opinions as well as different interpretations of the consequences of this agreement. As far I as can make out, the current status of the negotiations provides for an imbalance in the treatment of geographic indications and marks, in favour of the latter, as well as the failure to act, in violation of Article 22 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of International Property Rights, on marks that use denominations protected by geographical indications. ‘Parmesan’ – one of a number of possible examples – can be freely produced as ‘Parmesan’ in the United States and Australia and exported to China or elsewhere in direct competition with European products, one of the strengths of which is geographical indications. Consequently, European products seem to be propping up unfair competition without any effective protection from the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. I should like a clarification in this regard. ‘Parmesan’ means ‘from Parma’, not Australia or the United States, and this applies equally to all European geographic indications. We must be careful because if, in the course of 21st century globalisation, in a few years’ time, we no longer have our geographic indications, it will partly be because of today’s mistaken choices and we shall lose an enormous piece of our identity. In this regard, if all that were permitted by the ACTA, the agreement would be unacceptable. There is also the question of the Internet, as already mentioned. The European Union is in favour of a society of widespread knowledge, open to all, and the ACTA must not in any way constitute a restriction on the freedom of access to the Internet. Much has been gained on this issue. The Commissioner has given his important assurances, but it would be unacceptable if the acquis communautaire
 were tarnished, as still appears to be the case, by the possibility of legal injunctions provided for by Article 2, and by the possibility of criminal sanctions, including for individual users, as provided for by Article 2(14)(1). I appreciate the highly important assurances on access to medicine for developing countries, but we know that the list of countries adhering to the ACTA is very limited and excludes the great powers of counterfeiting, in Asia, in particular, but not only there. So for this reason, given everything we have to lose on geographic indications and risks on the Internet, the impression – for now – is that the agreement represents only a disadvantage and on this basis, perhaps it is better to let it drop.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs De Keyser has already said nearly all there is to say. I would like to dedicate this minute to a baby boy who I met on 1 December 2009 in Luanda, when we were in Angola for the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly. The baby boy was at the end of his life, he was dying due to malnutrition in his mother’s arms in the Divine Providence Hospital in the centre of Luanda, near the place where we were doing our work and near the stadium that was being built for the African Cup; in other words, he was surrounded by plenty. Yet this was not an isolated case: every day in Luanda, children are still dying of hunger, due to malnutrition, in the arms of their young mothers who have not been taught anything about nutrition and who are often left to their own devices. For a Christian, sights like this constitute a sin – a great sin; for a politician, they are a sign of the failure of our policies; and for the ruling class of that country, Angola, they are also a sign of greed and the unfair distribution of wealth. I believe the reasons why that child had such a fleeting existence on the earth give us much food for thought and I hope my testimony will contribute to this reflection. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a summit between China and the European Union is a model affair between two friends who have mutual reasons for satisfaction. In certain respects, they go back a long way, because Europe and China have both contributed to a safer and more prosperous world. Trade policy represents a crucial factor in this combined effort, even if something is not working properly, and even if it is true to say that over the last five years, the European trade deficit has tripled. This is not sustainable for the European Union but perhaps inevitable, due to China’s constant social and environmental dumping, its world record for counterfeit medicines, its market that is closed to services, its unwillingness to take part in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and its instinctive reaction to conduct a closed policy, even with regard to human rights: from the oppression of Tibet, which is culturally, spiritually and ethnically stifled, to this obstinate refusal to recognise the de facto sovereignty of Taiwan, the repression of freedom of expression in the media and on the Internet and the shameful systematic use of the death penalty. All this is old politics to us – and we are bound to say this to our Chinese friends – because why should we offend the intelligence of a people whose civilisation has always kept pace with the times? We have little to teach China. Quite the contrary: all the competitive clout wielded by the Chinese, including in trade policy, derives from the fact that China has 1.5 billion inhabitants and one Foreign Minister, 1.5 billion inhabitants and one fiscal policy, 1.5 billion inhabitants and one currency, and the Europe of 27 + 1, which constantly falters in its dealings with China, still has a lot to learn and must recover its unity.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, discussing the problems of sparsely populated areas and of the outermost islands in this Chamber – especially in the light of my parliamentary commitment to mountain regions – is the first step towards creating a network to preserve these regions, in which European citizens live in completely unique conditions and often on low incomes. These are sparsely populated areas with low population density in which there is a phenomenon of ageing populations, because the young people often leave, and a percentage of graduates that is below the national average. These criteria, particularly GDP, but there are others too, need to inspire a European support strategy for mountain regions, which have fewer services, infrastructure problems and which are particularly vulnerable due to the agricultural crisis and climate change. Mountains are places in which people live and which they study, and today they must also become a political laboratory, because they are an immense resource for cultural, clean energy and quality agriculture development, and for the quality of life that is indispensable for guaranteeing greater well-being among urban populations. Beyond the Commission, the Member States and the local authorities, it is the responsibility of local communities, too, to understand how to control their own destiny in 21st century Europe, with an integrated approach and especially active participation in decision making. I speak from experience when I say that in mountain regions, it is better to organise 10 local sporting events than one single World Cup, and this should be the working method for everybody: we should increase the number of widespread initiatives and demonstrate greater political creativity, starting with the creation within the College of Commissioners of a specific delegation for mountain regions and islands.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mr Kazak’s report which basically tells us that the European Union has a remarkable instrument in its hands to further develop its relations, including its political relations, with Turkey: the commercial policy. The crucial geo-strategic position of Turkey for the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Central Asia and the Caucasus has already been noted. There is a beautiful poem by the Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet which goes: ‘this country shaped like the head of a mare coming full gallop from far off Asia to stretch into the Mediterranean’. We would like the mare that is Turkey to be a true fulcrum of the relations with these regions, of which Turkey is one of their centres. However, to make this happen, political and trade relations with Armenia need to be stabilised, the Cyprus question needs to be closed, and I would highlight paragraph 11 of Mr Kazak’s report on the actuation and application of the customs union with regard to the part of Cyprus occupied by Turkey. So not everything is perfect. Mrs Balzani also pointed out that there are some problems, especially in the areas of counterfeiting, the defence and protection of intellectual property, and the application of the customs union to the services sector and to procurement. I would like to thank Mr Kazak. The Mediterranean is destined to change and we want to change it together with Turkey, which, according to the International Monetary Fund, is expected to experience growth of some 37% between now and 2020, which tells us all we need to know.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘acta est fabula, plaudite!
’ – ‘the play is over, applaud!’ – as Roman actors used to say at the end of a performance. The play is over and perhaps we are on the eve of its conclusion, although it may not yet be time to applaud. During this debate, we have been given important reassurances by Mr De Gucht, but we know that 64% of counterfeit goods come from China, which is not a party to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). We will therefore need to assess whether it is all worthwhile – in other words, whether we ought to sign the agreement if it does not bring any real benefits, as the Commissioner concluded. There are not many causes of concern remaining, but they are significant. A lot has been said about the Internet, and we appreciate the Commission’s efforts, but we remain vigilant. As regards access to medicines, I repeat what has already been demanded by other Members: there can be no lumping together of counterfeit medicines on the one hand and generic medicines on the other. It is vital to allow access to medicines at competitive prices, which are crucial for patients in developing countries. The question I should like to ask is whether the Doha declaration on the TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement and public health will be included at least in the preamble of the ACTA text. Lastly, as regards geographical indications, we find ourselves in a potentially paradoxical situation, because registered trademarks that might violate geographical indications would enjoy greater protection than the geographical indications themselves. Here, too, TRIPS provides a sounder basis in many respects, and we therefore call for vigilance and a firm stance. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are a little like the Ryong, the dragons of Korean mythology, which are gentle, benevolent but highly determined dragons. We are also aware that we are the European institution that is directly elected by our citizens, and we therefore call for an effective safeguard clause. Parliament is willing to conclude the agreement at first reading, but on condition that there are concrete proposals taking account of the interests of European workers and industries and especially of Parliament’s institutional prerogatives. We have six demands, which have already been put forward in part by other Members. The first one is no provisional implementation before the safeguard regulation has been adopted and before Parliament has given the agreement its approval. The second is a regional or, in any case, a flexible safeguard clause, because Europe is diverse and it is important for the agreement to be accepted and welcomed by its various stakeholders. The third and even more important demand concerns Parliament’s role in the procedures: the right to call an investigation – we have, of course, asked to extend this right to industry – the right to be given full information, and access to the online platform. The fourth concerns comitology in implementation of the regulation: the Council cannot have a greater role than Parliament. We insist on Parliament having a strong role, with a procedure – the advisory procedure – providing for a veto in cases where the Commission decides not to apply measures after an investigation. Fifthly, with regard to customs duty drawback, customs duties must be included in the safeguard clauses and must be one of the factors in any investigation and monitoring. Lastly, the sixth demand is that there needs to be monitoring of social and working conditions and environmental standards, and there needs to be a level playing field putting the Koreans and Europeans on an equal footing as regards CO2
. We are fully in favour of this Free Trade Agreement and of any Free Trade Agreement that is an instrument for stability and peace. Nobody, however, should be naive about its content, nor can the Council ignore Parliament’s role. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we do not want any more pogroms in Central Asia. Central Asia is a region that presents a high risk of interethnic conflicts. The peoples are very mixed, and the borders were drawn up under the Stalinist regime. Just consider that Kyrgyzstan has a Kyrgyz exclave in Uzbek territory, and there are four Uzbek enclaves in Kyrgyz territory, including one that is inhabited exclusively by Uzbek citizens living in Kyrgyzstan who are of Tajik nationality – this shows the complexity of the situation. We now have 300 000 people who are displaced. One hundred thousand people have taken refuge in Uzbekistan and very many have died: we do not even know how many, possibly even 2 000. What can be done? First of all, as the Commissioner stated, it is very important to guarantee justice, because – as the experience of other countries demonstrates – there can be no reconciliation without a form of justice. Therefore, we need to persevere with this committee of inquiry. The second point: while continuing to provide humanitarian aid, we also need to deal with a number of political issues. Mr Swoboda mentioned one, namely, that we must confirm to this interim government that it is, in fact, doing a good job. The referendum was a success not only from the point of view of its content, because it redresses the balance of the relationship between the Presidency and the parliament, but also because of the way in which it was organised and because of its high turnout. I would also like to understand how we Europeans should respond, if we do respond, to the OSCE request to send international police forces: shall we leave policing entirely up to the Russians, or will there also be a European contribution? The third point: what is the United States doing? It has a very large military base in Manas, but it seems to me that US influence in Central Asia is declining in general. I think it is important for us to harmonise certain issues with the US Administration as well. As for the 27 July donors’ conference mentioned by the Commissioner, I would like to understand what Europe’s priorities are here. I believe that we need to invest, above all, in education and in strengthening the civil society that exists in Kyrgyzstan. It is active, as the high turnout at the referendum showed. I would like to conclude by emphasising that the European strategy of taking a regional approach to Central Asia is certainly the right one. This is a region that needs to be considered in its entirety. I think that in the medium term, we will gradually need to apply this strategy to Afghanistan, too, because we cannot have one policy for Afghanistan and another for the countries of Central Asia – for the other countries of Central Asia. This is a paradigm case for the prevention of conflict, a little like what EU-FAST turned out not to be for Haiti, through the coordination of civil and emergency protection. We now have the legal instruments: the citizens wanted them, and we need to prove that we are up to the challenge. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I am in favour of this proposal because it aims to bring the new psychoactive substances under the same criminal law provisions as other substances controlled under the UN conventions. Psychoactive substances, like many other drugs, are a threat to society, affecting the functioning of the brain which creates symptoms such as changes in consciousness, behaviour and cognition. Tackling the distribution of psychoactive substances is not to be underestimated. Though Member States do have their own policies on tackling illicit drugs, when psychoactive substances are being distributed from one Member State to another efficient cooperation between Member States is indispensable, especially in an era when commerce and communication are no longer limited by physical and geographical boundaries.

 I support this proposal as it empowers the Union to take steps to protect cultural national treasures, in the context of the opening-up of the Union’s internal borders. This acknowledges the need to provide cultural objects special protection in the light of the rules governing the internal market. In addition this proposal aims to improve cooperation between the national authorities responsible for matters related to the return of cultural objects. For this reason it is proposing that authorities should make use of a new EU administrative cooperation instrument: the Internal Market Information system (IMI). The IMI is an electronic tool designed to improve communication and cooperation between the authorities of the Member States in the context of the implementation of internal market legislation. That will make it possible to share information about national treasures and stolen cultural objects, it will provide secure internet access, and will be used in all the EU official languages.

 I am in favour of this report because it aims to ensure the efficient monitoring of the crossing of external borders. It is fundamental to set strict rules for the search and rescue operations and on the identification of migrants intercepted at sea in order to enable Frontex to respond more effectively and to prevent deaths at sea. The “operational plan” governing Frontex-coordinated border surveillance operations must henceforth include procedures to ensure that persons needing international protection, victims of trafficking in human beings, unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable persons are identified and given appropriate help. Furthermore, through the sea operation, the participating units will address the special needs of children, victims of trafficking, persons in need of urgent medical assistance, disabled persons, persons in need of international protection and other persons in a particularly vulnerable situation throughout the sea operation.

 I support this report, because I believe in the importance of improvement of transparency and predictability of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations. The parties affected by the imposition of provisional anti-dumping and countervailing measures, in particular, importers should be made aware of the imposition of such measures. This proposal aims at modernising both the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations, entails four central changes: the removal of the lesser duty rule in anti-dumping cases where structural raw material distortions are present and in all anti-subsidy cases, the obligation for Union producers to cooperate in ex-officio investigations, the reimbursement of duties collected during expiry reviews, and the two weeks' notice before provisional duties are introduced, commonly referred to as the shipping clause. The Commission’s rationale is based on three objectives: to increase the effectiveness of the instruments, to reduce the threat of retaliation from third country, and to increase transparency and predictability.

 I voted in favour of this proposal because the fraud and related illegal activities affecting the Union’s financial interests pose a serious problem to the detriment of the Union budget and thereby the taxpayers. For this reason we call to the European institutions to ensure that public money is devoted to structural growth, fiscal consolidation and jobs. There are differences among the Member States legal and sanctioning systems. This fragmented legal framework creates incentives, for the potential perpetrators, to move across the European territory to the most favourable judicial system. I believe we should respond with a unique voice to fraud and any other activities affecting the financial interests of the Union through deterrent measures. I consider this proposal for a directive on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interest also as an important step in the field of EU Criminal Law. This area has been significantly enhanced since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and should be used to the fullest extent. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this proposal because with this text we lay down provisions for the European Parliament to set up temporary committees of inquiry to investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Community law. I consider it is of fundamental importance to guarantee inquiry committees the possibility to request documents, to summon witnesses, to hear officials and other servants of the Union or of Member States and to request experts’ reports when necessary to carry out investigations. However I believe that Parliament should lead the way in ensuring that the inquiry committee remains independent. For this reason it should closely monitor the impartiality and discretion of the examination and assure transparency and accountability throughout the investigation process. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted for this report as the development of relations between European Parliament and national parliaments is of essential importance. The resulting exchange of information is enabling the national parliaments to provide the EP with sounder evaluations and the EP to adopt decisions on the basis of broad consensus. This is ought to make it easier for European provisions to be transposed into national law rapidly and effectively by the national parliaments. Another important aspect is the so-called 'European mainstreaming' within the national parliaments, where European awareness can be achieved much more effectively by the national parliaments than by the European Parliament.

 I support this report in order to further elevate EU-Japan relations through the timely conclusion of the negotiations of a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement. Japan has been an EU strategic partner since 2003 and since has already cooperated in a number of fields such as customs cooperation and legal assistance in criminal matters, science and technology, internet security, academic and research cooperation, the peaceful use of nuclear energy, business community contacts and the promotion of people-to-people links. Moreover, the further enhancement of EU-Japan relations will aim at providing a long-standing framework for a closer relationship contributing considerably to the deepening of political, economic and cultural relations with tangible results for the citizens of both regions.

 I voted for this report as I believe we need to support the financial institutions of the Republic of Tunisia in order to sustain the population and strengthen their path onto democracy. Thanks to the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, Tunisia was the first Mediterranean country to enter in a free trade area with the Union. Unfortunately Tunisia's economy has been significantly affected by the "Arab Spring" and by the regional unrest that followed, particularly in neighbouring Libya. These events and the weak global economic environment, in particular the recession in the euro area, Tunisia's main trading and financial partner, has had a very negative impact on the Tunisian economy, leading to a slowdown in growth and generating large external and budgetary financing gaps. For this reason I think that the Union's macro-financial assistance will aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external financing situation of the country thereby supporting its economic and social development.

 I backed this proposal because I believe that the objectives of the European Maritime Fisheries Fund are to boost innovation, help communities diversify their economies, finance projects that create new jobs and improve the quality of life along the European coast.

 I fully support this proposal because it aims at achieving a greater impact on research and innovation by developing closer synergies, increasing coordination and avoiding unnecessary duplications with international, national and regional research programmes.

 I voted for this report because I believe that the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme will accelerate the clinical development of effective, safe and affordable medical interventions for poverty-related diseases. There is a need to develop partnership with developing countries such as sub-Saharan Africa to tackle the negative impacts of poverty-related diseases which affect 1 billion people. Moreover, given the humanitarian aspect of this important sector we need to make sure that the best possible outcomes are achieved. Therefore, coordinating closely with other organisations from public, private and voluntary sectors is also vital, not only to maximise the investments of Members States but also to minimise overlap and duplication.

 I voted against this report because although I support completely the need to urge Russia to undertake a credible, thorough and independent investigation into Sergei Magnitskyʼs death in pre-trial detention, and to bring all those responsible to justice, I believe that ordering a visa restriction for people not condemned by a tribunal would be inconsistent with our own legal standards.

With this text we reiterate our full support for the International Criminal Court and we urge the EU to continue fighting against the use of the death penalty and to strongly support the moratorium as a step towards abolition. As for bilateral relations between EU and UN, it is essential to support actively a comprehensive reform of the United Nations system, and especially its Security Council, in order to strengthen its legitimacy, regional representation, accountability and effectiveness. We also need to work towards the goal of the EU having a seat in an enlarged UNSC. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I support this report because it highlights the importance of having free European media, in particular a financially sustainable and independent broadcasting service able to promote EU democratic values. I consider as being of fundamental importance informing the public about the policies and goals of the EU, notably by enhancing understanding of the issues that unite and divide Europe and so bringing EU citizens closer together. Moreover I believe in the need to establish a coherent EU media broadcasting strategy in the context of the EU’s external relations by promoting freedom of expression and media pluralism and by strengthening democracy and human rights in Europe and in third countries.

 I voted for this report because the European Consensus on Development remains the most comprehensive basis for Union development cooperation. It sets out common objectives and principles for development and underlines the Union’s commitment to poverty eradication. The European Year for Development will also act as a catalyst for EU support by raising awareness through political public debate, building momentum and exchanging best practices between Member States, local and regional authorities and civil society. It will help foster a sense of joint responsibility and solidarity among Europeans and people in developing countries. Combating global poverty is not only a moral obligation, it will also help to build a more stable and peaceful world, reflecting the interdependence of richer and poorer countries. The Lisbon Treaty has firmly anchored development policy within Union external action in support of the Union’s interest in a stable and prosperous and more equitable world. Development policy also helps address other global challenges and contributes to the EU-2020 Strategy. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this proposal because I believe it is important that Member States get appropriate instruments to ensure the effective exercise of the Union’s rights in international trade agreements. In my opinion this is a highly important piece of legislation which will streamline the EU’s ability to act quickly and more efficiently, with measures to enforce its trading rights coming from dispute settlement decisions. I believe that in a global context where the number of retaliatory trade actions is increasing the mere existence of this recommended regulation will present a credible threat and will hopefully dissuade our trading partners from not respecting the rules of the game.

 I voted in favour of this resolution because I strongly believe that both internal political developments in Iran and the interim agreement on the nuclear issue have opened a great window of opportunity both for reforms within Iran and an improvement in its external relations with the EU. Most of all I am particularly satisfied because with this text we call for a more independent EU policy towards Iran. We also urged the Council to start a discussion on the relief of the nuclear-related sanctions. In addition I believe that Iran should be involved in the discussions for finding a solution for the Syrian crisis. On the other hand, I consider it important that, besides the nuclear deal, various topics including human rights and regional security need to be discussed between the EU and Iran. In this resolution we express our grave concern regarding the human rights situation in Iran, in particular the widespread allegations of torture, unfair trials and the high number of executions in 2013 and 2014.

 I fully support the creation of an Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund because it will offer support to Member States to identify, share and promote best practices and to establish effective cooperation in the framework of the Common European Asylum System. The aim of this Fund is to create flexible tools which will allow Member States to receive financial resources according to their specific situation and needs. I also consider of great importance the fact that the main objective of the Fund is to promote effective integration of third-country nationals. On top of that it will enhance solidarity and responsibility between Member States. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this regulation because I believe it is necessary to adopt an integrated EU approach towards migration and asylum applications. I also believe that a comprehensive EU immigration policy will not only enhance social cohesion inside the European Union but it will also create a strong deterrent against illegal immigration, human trafficking and terrorism. With this text we also stress the importance that all Member States must create an area without internal borders where people may enter, move, live and work freely, confident that their rights are fully respected and their security assured.

 I am strongly against this resolution because its text consists of a series of attacks on Russia with the tone and language of the Cold War. This will only help to inflame the debate and to destabilise Ukraine. The resolution ignores the fact that half of Ukraine is pro-Russian and Russian-speaking and has no plans whatsoever to join the EU or NATO. To oblige Ukraine to make a choice between the EU and Russia means splitting the country and encouraging its dissolution. I believe that threatening Russia with sanctions, without leaving space for political dialogue and negotiation, is completely irresponsible. In addition I am astonished by the reckless decision of the Commission and the European Council to allocate a huge sum, EUR[nbsp ]11 billion, just for a couple of years, in favour of Ukraine. We do not have such money. And we cannot trust to have it back from a corrupt country on the brink of bankruptcy. We did not ask for any prior commitment by the Ukrainian Government in the fight against corruption, nor did we explore alternative financial aid possibilities, such as recovery of the assets of the Ukrainian oligarchs that are hidden in European banks.

 I voted in favour of that report because its aim is to prevent inconsistencies from the policies pursued by the EU and so avoid adverse repercussions for developing countries. With this text we call on the EU and its Member States to ensure that the new ‘post-2015’ framework includes a Policy Coherence for Development objective which makes it possible to develop reliable indicators to measure the progress of donors and partner countries and to assess the impact of the various policies on development.

 I am in favour of this report because it acknowledges that the revelations concerning the US NSA surveillance programme since June 2013 have profoundly shaken the trust between the two transatlantic partners and the trust between citizens and their governments. These revelations also undermined the confidence of members of the public in the functioning of democratic institutions on both sides of the Atlantic. With this text we strongly condemn the vast and systemic blanket collection of the personal data of random people, often including intimate personal information. It is important to make it clear that the systems for indiscriminate mass surveillance by intelligence services constitute a serious interference with the fundamental rights of citizens. Privacy is not a right that is a luxury, but is the foundation stone of a free and democratic society. In addition mass surveillance has potentially severe effects on freedom of the press, thought and speech and on freedom of assembly. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I strongly support this report because I believe that the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) constitutes fundamental progress in the judicial cooperation between Member States in criminal matters.

In particular, it would be really important to review the judicial remedies for the determination of the competent court and for criminal activities which fall within the competence of the EPPO.

 I support this resolution because I agree that Turkey is a strategic partner for the EU and an important regional player for its wider neighbourhood. I am in favour of full EU membership for Turkey. For these reasons I am deeply concerned at the recent developments in Turkey with regard to allegations of high-level corruption. With this text we strongly regret the removal of the prosecutors and police officers in charge of the original investigations, as this goes against the fundamental principle of an independent judiciary and deeply affects the prospects for credible investigations. I consider regrettable the serious breakdown of trust between the government, the judiciary, the police and the media. Therefore, it is fundamental to urge Turkeyʼs Government to show full commitment to democratic principles and to refrain from any further interference in the investigation and prosecution of corruption.

 Mr President, I believe the discussion today is an opportunity to call on the UN Human Rights Council to follow up the implementation of the UN Secretary-General’s recommendations on the protection of human rights in Western Sahara. Morocco, as a new member of UNHRC, should acknowledge the right of the Sahrawi people to self-determination in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions and should put an end to the ongoing violation of human rights of the Sahrawi people. Also, I believe that Morocco should urgently release all Sahrawi political prisoners. For these reasons, I would like to ask all colleagues to vote in favour of all the amendments on Western Sahara proposed by the political groups. We cannot turn a blind eye to this unlawful occupation, and we cannot ignore the fact that one of our neighbouring countries is perpetrating the last case of colonial oppression in Africa.

 I support this report because this new directive will improve the legislation which prevents the conversion of the proceeds of criminal activity into legitimate funds via the financial system. To be able to do that, the operations of business registers have to be improved. Indeed, the identification of the beneficial owner of the business or the business transaction is crucial in preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. We must bear in mind that massive flows of illicit money damage the stability and reputation of the financial sector and threaten the single market as well as international development. I am persuaded that, in addition to the criminal law approach, a preventive effort via the financial system can produce results. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I strongly support this report, which denounces the continued occurrence of torture and other forms of ill-treatment throughout the world. We have the duty to reiterate at every opportunity the absolute condemnation of such acts, which are and must remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified. With this text we underline that the implementation of the EU guidelines on torture remains insufficient, and therefore we urge the European External Action Service and the Member States to give renewed impetus to the application of those guidelines.

 Mr. President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I share the view that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is an influential political, economic and religious actor in the Middle East and the Islamic world. It is also the world’s leading oil producer and an important partner for the EU. Nonetheless, we cannot ignore that KSA is the only country in the world in which women are not allowed to drive. With this text we call on the KSA authorities to eliminate all restrictions on women’s human rights, freedom of movement, health, education, marriage, employment opportunities, legal personality and representation in judicial processes, and all forms of discrimination against women in family law and in private and public life. Also, we ask Saudi Arabia to define a minimum age for marriage and take steps to ban child marriage in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which were both ratified by KSA.

 I am among the signatories of this text and I supported it because I believe that the growth of instability in Iraq must be addressed in a coherent and effective manner. Iraq is suffering from a new surge in sectarian violence and we need to advocate an inclusive political process in view of the elections planned for April 2014. Iraq has seen about 1[nbsp ]500 civilian deaths from violence since the beginning of this year.

 Mr President, I have two questions for Commissioner Füle. First, I appreciated the most recent position taken by Baroness Ashton on the Ukraine-EU-Russia relationship. She says that the crisis in Ukraine was wrongly perceived as a confrontation between East and West, when the reality is that of a convergence and a synergy. Baroness Ashton accepts the concept of a Eurasian integration process where Russia and the EU cooperate in the creation of a common area of trade, stability and peace. My question is: why insist on keeping two systems of customs union alive, instead of creating just one free-trade zone?  Secondly, the Ukrainian Parliament is proposing to have in a new government three ministers who belong to the Svoboda Party, which is a neo-Nazi, anti-Semitic entity. What do you intend to do to maintain coherence with your past position on the inclusion of the Haider party in the Government of Austria? Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Mr[nbsp ]President, I am listening here to a long list of horror stories about Iraq. A few of my colleagues have mentioned what was a major origin of the horror, namely the war – one of the most stupid, expensive and useless wars of the last decades, waged in the name of exporting democracy and defending us from threats that did not exist. So, since this is a time when many of us would like Europe to play an increasing role in the world, with more intervention, accomplishing more and better things on all fronts, I would simply like to remind my colleagues that once the cameras have gone, once the spotlight has shifted, the problem may be that democracy is not there in the way that you expected. You have to contribute to rebuilding a country which is very hard to rebuild, and you have to address all the problems that are now apparent. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 This Parliament is taking a very important position on the issue of the use of armed drones. The resolution agreed upon is the first step towards the total prohibition of the use of this horrible weapon.  If there is one reason to forbid forever the use of drones it is simply the fact that they are a new weapon. We received a Nobel Prize for peace, and one of the main points is this: stop inventing new weapons; stop using technology and science to invent new weapons. So I am really surprised by all these limitations that are put by some colleagues on this issue. International law prohibits arbitrary killings, and this should be the main reason, in addition to what I have already said, for having a firm position against this new weapon. So I hope that this resolution will be the first step towards a total ban on this weapon. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted for this report because the proposal for a new legislation on confiscation of the proceeds of crime was strongly advocated by this Parliament. Thanks to this directive, Member States will have common rules for the freezing and confiscation of criminal assets through direct confiscation, value confiscation, extended confiscation, non-conviction-based confiscation and third-party confiscation. This will harmonise the EUʼs freezing and confiscation regimes, facilitating mutual trust and effective cross-border cooperation. Most of all, it will also constitute a step towards strengthening the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders which is an important aspect of the fight against cross-border serious and organised crime in the EU.

 I voted for this report because I support the creation of the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps. The Corps will fill the gaps which currently exist in humanitarian volunteer work, and will also help to cultivate public awareness and the idea of EU citizenship.

 I fully support the creation of this regulation because, as the economic crisis is exacerbating poverty and social exclusion across the Union, we must take tangible actions to alleviate the needs of the most deprived persons. In fact the aim of this Fund is to establish a new, broader instrument, able to relieve the most severe forms of poverty such as food and material impoverishment. Although the budget for the Fund is still far from being enough, nonetheless it does have the potential to play an important role ensuring the predictability of the support, which is essential for the charities and civil society organisations. I also believe that it is important to stress that this kind of fund should remain a complement to national policies, as the obligation to combat and eliminate poverty remains the responsibility of Member States.

 I voted against this resolution because I could not agree less with its approach to the Ukrainian crisis. Ukraine is not an EU protectorate. It is a sovereign country with a freely elected parliament. We should stop telling them what kind of government they should have, what kind of constitution they should adopt, and when and how to hold elections. It is not the European Union’s business to ‘liberate’ Ukraine or to take sides in its political process. It is ridiculous to ask Russia to stop retaliatory measures against Ukraine and, at the same time, to threaten EU sanctions if it does not follow our diktat. I believe that the latest events in Ukraine show, instead, the need for a thorough review of the Eastern Partnership project. This policy should be redesigned with a view of including Russia in its scope and not antagonising a country which is not an enemy – because Russia is part of Europe and should be treated accordingly.

 I voted for this resolution, which endorses the Commission’s communication entitled ‘Towards the elimination of female genital mutilation’. With this tool, EU funding to prevent female genital mutilation (FGM) and to improve support for victims will be increased. FGM is a brutal practice which does not occur only in third countries but also affects women and girls living in the EU and constitutes a clear violation of fundamental rights. For this reason we call, via with this resolution, on the Member States to use all existing mechanisms to pursue, prosecute and punish any resident who has committed the crime of FGM, even if the offence was committed outside the borders of the Member State concerned.

The ATT will prevent the illegal trade of weapons, international terrorism and organised crime and will limit serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. The strongest point of the ATT is that state parties are obliged to establish a national control system for these transfers and to evaluate, before authorising any transfer, the risk that these arms might impair peace and security or could be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law or human rights. It is also important that not only trade of arms but other acts such as rental, licensing, grants and transfers of relevant technology also fall under the prohibition. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I believe that in the last few days Ukraine has shown up a need for a deep review of our Eastern partnership project. The major flaw of our Eastern policies is their anti-Russian, Cold War profile. This policy should be redesigned with a view to including a rational approach and not antagonising a country which is not an enemy; because Russia is part of Europe and should be treated accordingly.  Another major blunder is our excessive interference in Ukrainian political affairs. Ukraine is not an EU protectorate; it is a sovereign country with a freely-elected parliament. We should stop telling them what kind of government they should have, what kind of constitution they should adopt and when and how to have a political election.

 Madam President, it is time for the EU to stop taking sides and positions at every political turn in the Egyptian transition. Europe should focus its attention on the quality of institution-building. Therefore, our efforts should all be directed at strengthening the rule of law and bolstering institutions and economic reform. To that end, I attach primary importance to major issues such as asset recovery. The restitution of frozen assets is – over and above its economic significance – a strong signal against the impunity for corruption and money laundering that has so far been enjoyed by unscrupulous political leaders in Egypt and elsewhere. I would reiterate that the only way to build a sustainable democracy in Egypt is by following the path of national reconciliation and inclusive political process. Any ban, exclusion or repression directed against any political force or actor in Egypt repeats past mistakes and leads only to increased radicalism. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this proposal, which will significantly reduce bureaucracy and remove yet another obstacle to a truly transnational and borderless European Union. The regulation aims to fulfil the very important role of making formalities easier for citizens who move across borders. A large number of EU citizens live in a Member State other than their own, and this number is steadily increasing. However, administrative formalities across borders are generally considerably more complicated than within each Member State. For this reason this text aims to simplify the cross-border recognition of public documents and to reduce the number of documents needing certified translation. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I fully support this motion because wildlife crime constitutes a threat to the welfare of the animals and to the conservation of the animal and plant species concerned, putting the local ecosystems as a whole at risk. Furthermore, illicit wildlife trafficking often involves transnational organised criminal networks and is used as a source of revenue with an annual turnover of at least USD 19 billion. This is why tackling wildlife crime requires a coordinated global response at the highest political level and between enforcement agencies. Moreover, an EU plan of action against wildlife crime and trafficking needs to be established and effective judicial systems developed in order to better combat this crime at local, national and regional level.

I voted for this resolution because, although equality should be a fundamental principle in the European Union, there is still discrimination concerning the access to the healthcare system. As a matter of fact, the healthcare system is in many cases restricted as a result of financial constraints. I do believe that the eHealth system could play a key role in reducing these inequalities. Nonetheless, Member States must invest in affordable, high-quality health systems. Moreover, some patients are obliged to undergo medical treatment outside their country of residence and this is not acceptable. Also, I would like to highlight that every citizen should have the opportunity to use IT tools or the skills needed to take advantage of eHealth services and we have the duty to make this possible.

I voted for this report because it is necessary to regain consumer confidence in the single market for foods, as the agri-food sector is one of the biggest sectors in the EU economy, providing 48 million jobs and worth EUR 715 billion annually. I would like to point out the importance of inspections and the effectiveness of unannounced inspections, which should be made regular and mandatory by Member States. Additionally, there is a need for Member States to improve coordination between different health authorities, given that a lack of adequate information exchange often paves the way for dishonest actors in the supply chain.

I voted for this resolution because I believe that labour inspection plays an important role in protecting employees’ rights. It is the responsibility of companies to ensure legal working conditions but unfortunately they do not always do so. Irregularly employed workers suffer from consequences such as the fear of having an accident or being caught, which in turn affects the productivity of companies and the economy as a whole. We need to win the fight against unsafe working environments. Also, in this time of economic crisis, undeclared work has negative consequences for Member States’ economies and creates social and financial insecurity. For all these reasons, all Member States must commit to taking the necessary measures on this issue at national level. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I support this resolution because it stresses the need for the EU and its Member States to honour their commitments to fulfil the ‘aid effectiveness agendaʼ. The Treaties give the EU the legal basis to strengthen the coherence and the effectiveness of the EUʼs external action and the only obstacles to this are lack of political will and bureaucracy. It is vital that more effective coordination is achieved by the EU and its Member States through joint programming, including domestic division of labour in order to avoid overlapping of actions and high transaction costs. Moreover there is a clear need to undertake a careful analysis of each recipient countryʼs specific needs, while ensuring that projects financed are embedded in the local economy and benefit those most in need.

I voted in favour of this regulation establishing a new instrument for stability and peace as I believe it is vital to support a common EU action on preserving peace and strengthening international security. This financial instrument aims to increase stability and security in the areas of conflict prevention, crisis response and peace-building. Even though I supported this text however, I believe that there is still room for improvement.

I voted in favour of this regulation establishing a new Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance as I believe it is extremely important to encourage and support countries in transition towards accession to the Union. In addition, I think this instrument could also generate far-reaching benefits to Member States as the enlargement process reinforces stability in Europe and allows the Union to address global challenges. I believe it is essential to make a better use of the funds and provide motivation for using the assistance in a proper manner.

I fully support Parliamentʼs position on the legislative proposal renewing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) as I strongly believe that the current crisis is exacerbating unemployment rates and poverty across the Union. I consider this fund to be a valid instrument able to mitigate the effects of such a persistent difficult economic situation by introducing financial support for re-skilling workers made redundant and facilitating their re-integration. In addition, I believe that a new EGF criterion with the wider eligibility scope signifies a more precise answer to market needs. Indeed the new EGF will now include: small and medium enterprises, the self-employed, workers with non-standard employment contracts and farmers. On top of that I completely agree with the importance of softening the stringent conditions imposed by the application procedure. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I was strongly against this agreement it is a blatant violation of human rights. Morocco invaded and occupied militarily the territory of Western Sahara and it has no legal title to dispose of its natural resources. Today, in entering into an agreement for the exploitation of Western Sahara’s waters, Parliament has agreed to be an accomplice of a colonial robbery. The text of the agreement contains a generic and hypocritical reporting obligation for the Kingdom on the respect of human rights and international law. Morocco does not have the slightest credibility in this regard, as it continues to practice torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, along with targeted assassination and political persecution in the occupied territories.

The number and gravity of natural and man-made disasters increased significantly in the past years, and climate change is expected to trigger even more extreme disasters in the future.

The newly created South Sudan is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 50 % of the population living below the poverty line. Also, having emerged from a war and being located in an unstable region, it is in danger of failing if the international community and local stakeholders fail to cooperate in developing a joint strategy to turn it into a democratic and inclusive state.

Madam President, as a shadow rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Instrument, I would like to congratulate Mr Kukan for the huge effort and the result obtained during these difficult negotiations. With this instrument we finally have a good tool for implementation of the neighbourhood policy, especially with regard to the principle of a partnership of societies. More specifically, I hope this instrument will provide a good base for rebuilding our Eastern Partnership. The previous debate demonstrated what the major flaw of our eastern policy was: its anti-Russian profile and its cold-war and clash of civilisations inspiration. All the foreign policy instruments we are discussing are opportunities for dialogue and cooperation, not for confrontation with the ghosts of the past. Let us learn the lesson of the failed Eastern Partnership and move forward, making better use of these powerful instruments. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

Madam President, Morocco invaded and militarily occupied the territory of Western Sahara and has no legal title to dispose of Western Sahara’s natural resources. The EU should not be an accomplice to a colonial robbery.  If Morocco and the Commission had intended to take into account the reason behind Parliament’s rejection of the fisheries agreement, they would have included in it the need for Morocco to give to the Sahrawi people the revenues coming from the exploitation of their waters. Otherwise they could have excluded from the agreement the waters of Western Sahara, following the example of the US Congress and US Government, which do not include Western Sahara in any economic agreement with Morocco. None of that has happened. The text of the agreement contains only a generic and hypocritical reporting obligation for the Kingdom of Morocco on respect for human rights in international law. Morocco does not have the slightest credibility in this regard as it continues to practice torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, along with targeted assassination and political persecution in the occupied territories. I reiterate therefore my earlier invitation to vote against this shameful agreement. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)). Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

The question has nothing to do with the core subject of this discussion. Even the USA can do something good; what they do is not necessarily wrong.

The principal aim of the European Neighbourhood Policy is to strengthen the partnership between the EU and the countries and societies of the neighbourhood, in order to build and consolidate healthy democracies, respect for human rights and the rule of law. For this reason I believe that this is the right context to discuss about the on-going violation of human rights in Western Sahara. As neighbours and partner countries, we must urge Morocco to continue negotiations for a peaceful and long-lasting solution of the Western Sahara conflict. The Sahrawi people have the right to self-determination through a democratic referendum, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. Also, I believe that Morocco should urgently release all the Sahrawi political prisoners. We cannot ignore that the rights of Sahrawis are those of us all.

The EU should do everything possible to save the lives of people in danger. For this reason with this resolution we welcome the intention of the European Commission to establish a task force on the issue of migratory flows in the Mediterranean. In addition the EU must continue to offer humanitarian, financial and political assistance in crisis areas in North Africa and the Middle East in order to tackle migration and humanitarian pressures at their root cause.

I fully support this report because it strengthens the control of trade in drug precursors, especially of acetic anhydride which is often used for the illicit production of heroin.  It is very important to create an EU system of licensing and registration capable of monitoring the trade of substances which are widely used in various legitimate industrial processes, but which can also be misused by criminals.

This report is really thorough in stressing the Sahrawiʼs right to self-determination and the need to organise a referendum. Unfortunately we lost an opportunity to highlight the importance of not re-instituting a fisheries agreement with Morocco while the controversy over the exploitation of Western Saharaʼs natural resources remains unresolved. In fact, to be consistent with our human right policies we should have voted for the amendment signed by almost 100 MEPs, asking the Commission to submit clear proposals on how such an agreement could be implemented in a manner acceptable to all parties concerned.

The persisting economic crisis and austerity measures in several Member States are putting the lives of EU citizens under heavy pressure due to unemployment, social exclusion and poverty. In particular, this austerity policy is having a direct adverse impact on young peoples’ prospects of gaining access to and remaining in education and employment.

We call too on the Member States to make public expenditure and investment in education, training, and research and innovation a priority.

 Madam President, Commissioner Füle, I am a strong believer in the European Neighbourhood Policy. This policy is the future of the European project and should continue to be characterised by the European spirit at its best, by which I mean tolerance, dialogue and leading by example. We should never see this policy degraded into a patronising and neocolonising endeavour. We are not carrying out an exercise of hostility and competition with Russia. We are not playing a repetition of the Great Game of two centuries ago, because Russia is also part of Europe and is not a threat to us. Likewise, we should not be perceived as a threat to them.

I support this resolution because it states that a lasting solution to the current crisis in Syria can only be achieved through a Syrian-led inclusive political process with the backing of the international community. For this reason it is fundamental to support the efforts of the European Union and of UN-Arab League Joint Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi to achieve progress in the Geneva II process and at the UN Security Council. With this text we also urge the EU and the Member States to live up to their humanitarian responsibilities and to increase their assistance to Syrian refugees. I personally strongly believe that any military intervention – with or without UN authorisation – in Syria is bound to have grave and highly unpredictable consequences and that a worsening of the situation on the ground cannot be excluded.

I support this text because after the military coup of July Egypt is in a very unstable and worrying situation. The political tensions continue to provoke violent clashes, which have resulted in more than 1 000 deaths and many more injured. I am firmly convinced that any exclusion or prosecution against a democratic political force or actor in Egypt can only lead to increased radicalism. We need to condemn in the stronger possible terms the disproportionate use of force against the protesters without penalising the Egyptian population while suspending aid to the country. In addition, with this resolution we urge the EU to proceed without delay to establish an EU mechanism providing legal and technical assistance to Arab Spring countries in the process of asset recovery. This instrument, already supported by this Parliament on several occasions, was delayed because of the turmoil in Egypt. It is vital to bear in mind that asset recovery has a highly symbolic value and may contribute largely to restoring accountability, creating stability and building solid institutions in the spirit of democracy and the rule of law in the partner countries concerned.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself for the umpteenth time – this is the third year of my term of office – and time and again we deal with the same problems as if it were the first time. And this year, as in every other year, we are once again witnessing a mass slaughter. The Mediterranean has now become an open mass grave. It is also the tomb of civilisation and, above all, the tomb of the hopes of thousands of people fleeing – men, women and children as has just been mentioned – fleeing from their countries and fleeing, above all, from civil and religious persecution. Europe has major responsibilities because it has negotiated with murderers like Gaddafi, who have used these poor martyrs – and Gaddafi did so precisely to raise the stakes and at the very moment Europe was in negotiations with Libya. Every time, we find ourselves debating the issue as if it were the first time. What I want to know is what are we planning to do about it? What actual responses are we going to give our citizens? Yet again, this is another tragedy and, as Mr Moraes quite rightly has pointed out, the Italian Government may have changed, but we still have to give answers. Sonia Alfano,

Mr President, I would like to offer you my best wishes on your new position. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy that today, we are debating in plenary a resolution that stems from the many petitions that reach the European Parliament, and that refers specifically to the question of waste. These petitions demonstrate the concern of European citizens about the harm done to the environment, human health and the economy by waste management practices prevalent in various areas in Europe. Even though I agree with the overall structure of the resolution, I am rather dissatisfied with how some of its passages address the issue of incinerators. At times, it seems that thanks to technology, any problem related to public health and the environment has been completely overcome. Until last year, right here, we were hearing the same words about nuclear power plants. Today, however, in this same Chamber, it is difficult to find anyone willing to defend the nuclear industry. Is it possible that politics is simply unable to take a long-term view? Do we really have to wait for more epidemiological studies confirming the increased cancer rates already found throughout populations living near incinerators? This is not the NIMBY syndrome, but simply the citizens defending their right to health. There are alternatives that are virtuous and create employment. We must implement the spirit of the Waste Management Directive strictly, with a waste cycle based on the concepts of reduction, reuse and recycling. Landfill and incineration are residual, hierarchically inferior options, resorted to only after everything else possible has been done. If there was a political will to that effect, incinerators would be a nice memory. I think that Parliament should take a more advanced stance and better protect its citizens in this area. I hope that the European Commission will propose stricter criteria and procedures for building incinerators and opening landfill sites, and encourage serious ‘zero waste’ policies in all Member States.

Madam President, I first of all wish to thank Mr Cashman for his excellent work and, in particular, for his great patience. As we all know, democracy is based on making legislative work public, on the transparency of the decision-making process, and on the people’s right to make informed decisions. For this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Treaties have proclaimed the fundamental right to access documents and information. This right must be guaranteed for all citizens, from local to international levels, in order to ensure that the institutions carry out the task for which they were created: to work on the citizens’ behalf in a transparent manner. Transparency is essential to prevent and combat corruption and the infiltration of the institutions at all levels by organised crime and powerful interests. I am particularly satisfied because the report on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding access to documents has accepted some important amendments which I submitted, in particular, those on financial and budgetary transparency, on the beneficiaries of European funds, on how EU money is spent, and on how European policies are implemented, all of which can be accessed via a database on the Internet. Other amendments submitted by me are included in the report, establishing rules for accessing information in electronic format contained in European databases, rules to limit exceptions to document access, especially when they refer to European legislative procedures, and rules for overriding the power of Member States to veto the publication of documents. The ALDE Group will therefore vote in favour of the Cashman report and I hope that the majority of this Parliament will support it, despite the opposition of some Members who have induced their groups to follow the interests of economic bureaucratic and industrial lobbies or those entrenched in the defence of the class and its secrets. The ALDE Group moreover asks the European Commission and Council to accept the proposals of the European Parliament and, under the Danish Presidency, to launch negotiations so as to finally take the necessary steps forward to assert the fundamental and democratic right of citizens to acquire the knowledge they require in order to make their decisions.

 Madam President, Commissioner, there are many facts that unfortunately lead us to the conclusion that human rights and freedom of expression are constantly being violated in Kazakhstan.

Their newspaper Stan.kz
 first went into print in March 2007 with a network of correspondents throughout Central Asia, providing prompt and professional information about what was going on in Kazakhstan and its neighbouring countries, and winning a positive response from the people. It is surely no coincidence that the attackers took the journalists’ laptop, which contained important video footage from the strikes of the oil company workers in Mańğystau. This is just the latest of many examples of intimidation which all too often involve the public authorities. I call on the Commission to take a decisive stance in condemning such practices and to take their attempts to violate the freedom of the press into due consideration in the EU’s negotiations with these countries. Finally, I support the proposal to organise a round table at EU level between the Kazakhstan authorities, the workers’ representatives in the province of Mańğystau and the oil company representatives, in order to find a solution to the serious situation that emerged with the strikes of May 2011.

 Mr President, I would like to request a roll-call vote for the final vote on the report on organised crime. My thanks go to all the shadow rapporteurs: Mr Iacolino, Mr Crocetta, Mr Albrecht, Mr de Jong, Mr Kirkhope, Ms Borsellino and Ms Costa, since they all made a decisive contribution to the drafting of the final report. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, relatives of mafia victims, judges and witnesses are here in the gallery. If Parliament adopts this report today, we will be giving due recognition, and be able to dedicate this work, to all the innocent victims of organised crime and mafias. Their memory, the memory of those who paid with their lives for choosing not to give in to the foulness of moral compromise must guide us, and it compels us to send strong, unequivocal signals, such as the one I hope we are about to send to Europe’s citizens today. (Applause) Sonia Alfano,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with the work that has been achieved with the political groups, particularly the shadow rapporteurs: Mr Iacolino for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Mr Crocetta for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Mr Albrecht for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mr Kirkhope for the European Conservatives and Reformists and Mr de Jong for the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. Their noteworthy contributions were decisive in arriving at an advanced and ambitious final draft. Organised crime and mafias are one of the main threats to the security and freedoms of the people of Europe. For the first time in European political history, an official document is making explicit reference to mafias and to the need for specific, transnational measures to fight them. It is crucial to focus on organised crime and mafias because, as the Europol reports show, organised criminal groups are cropping up everywhere; they are taking root in the Member States and have heavily infiltrated the economy, finance, politics and all levels of government. With this report, Parliament is proposing a concrete political line of attack, a serious, coordinated intervention and a treatment that is at last a match for the seriousness of the situation. This treatment is based on the intelligence gathering and analyses of those who fight organised crime every day. I take this opportunity to thank the judges, police representatives, researchers and witnesses who have contributed their precious experience to drawing up the definitive solutions proposed here. In a spirit of service and self-denial, they represent their Member States on a daily basis in an unequal fight against criminal organisations. What drives criminal organisations is profit. That is why in the report, we have prioritised attacking assets that can be directly or indirectly traced back to organised crime. We are therefore looking forward with extreme interest to the proposal for a directive that the Commission is due to submit in the coming months on a European body of law to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate criminal assets. I am therefore very happy to see Commissioner Reding here, and I would like to put Parliament’s specific political wishes to her. We ask for European rules to allow so-called extended confiscation and effective preventive measures, such as non conviction-based confiscation; we ask for rules to allow the targeting of assets held by front persons; and, above all, we call for rules to use confiscated assets for social purposes, so as to turn it into a cultural operation with the full involvement of civil society, without which merely fighting organised crime would be a wasted effort. To give an idea of the importance of the document to be voted on tomorrow, I will give a list of the measures requested at European level: harmonisation of legislation on organised crime; rules for greater victim protection; extension of the offence of mafia association to all Member States; greater coordination and cooperation between Europol, Eurojust and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and with national authorities; improved judicial cooperation and full implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions; rules on transparency and prevention to stop public funds ending up in the hands of organised criminals; rules to counter financial crime and money laundering; and rules to prevent people convicted of offences connected with organised crime from standing in European elections. We are absolutely sure about one thing, Commissioner: these demands, which we vigorously called for in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and which we are about to adopt here, will not remain mere words. We will use every means at our disposal to put them into practice, in line with the Treaties in force which, fully in accordance with the democratic nature of the European Union, assign to the national parliaments and the European Parliament the fundamental role of guiding and assessing policy in the area of freedom, security and justice so as to protect the interests of the people of Europe. That is why we hope the Commission will immediately acknowledge the political importance and significance of this House’s position. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I would like to dedicate this work – this first step that Parliament is about to take – to all the innocent victims of organised crime and mafias. Their memory, the memory of those who paid with their lives for choosing not to give in to the foulness of moral compromise, must guide us, and it compels us to send out strong, unequivocal signals, such as the one I hope we will send to the people of Europe tomorrow.

 Mr President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, the first meeting of the EU-Tunisia task force, which is charged with support for the transition to democracy and economic recovery, took place today. This year, Europe’s financial commitment was doubled, and obviously I welcome this, because Tunisia, with which we have a privileged partnership, has also agreed to accept sub-Saharan refugees fleeing from the war in Libya. The European Union, which has often reaffirmed its commitment to the refugees, must without fail support and aid Tunisia to manage these migration flows while fully respecting human rights. Norway, although not part of the European Union, has agreed to accommodate more than 300 refugees, while EU Member States have agreed to accommodate fewer than 400 refugees in total. I consider this to be a deplorable and shameful attitude, a real insult to the principle of solidarity that should underpin the European Union’s Mediterranean policy. I should remind you, what is more, that these refugees are currently confined in camps in intolerable conditions. This morning in this very Chamber the European Parliament approved by a large majority an allocation of EUR 43.9 million for managing the migrant and refugee flows arising from repression by authoritarian regimes and movements linked to the Arab Spring. These additional funds will be used to assist the Member States most affected by these flows and to reinforce marine patrols by Frontex. Let us reaffirm our assent to a Europe committed as much to the promotion of human rights as to the management of migration flows, and let us reject the idea of a fortress Europe that is xenophobic and closed. Today, the European Union is paying the price of its previous support for the dictatorial regimes of North Africa. Our former friends Gaddafi and Ben Ali have fallen or are falling and their people are fleeing repression. I should like to know what stage the joint EU resettlement programme, currently blocked in the Council, has reached. I am asking you, Commissioner, whom I know to be extremely sensitive and pro-active, how, in the current situation, can the European Union make a concrete commitment with regard to this humanitarian emergency? In conclusion, I am taking the opportunity of asking the Commission whether it is aware of what is happening in Palermo, where the Italian authorities are forcing 250 migrants to remain aboard a ship, without any provision authorising their detention, and denying them their right to freedom and to communicate with the outside world. Thanks to numerous reports presented to the Public Prosecutor’s Office at Palermo by many organisations in Palermo and Sicily fighting for human rights, the Palermo Public Prosecutor has just opened an investigation. This event follows some extremely serious facts that took place at Lampedusa last week, where the situation is out of control and where the safety of both the local population and that of the migrants themselves is at risk.

 Mr President, I would like to say something about the botched attempt at evacuation that took place in Parliament in Brussels last week. I think what happened was totally against the rules, because nobody came round to our rooms to warn us and tell us that we had to leave and evacuate the building, and then outside Parliament we were all free to do whatever we liked. I would therefore like to know how much this Parliament spends every year on evacuation procedures and Parliament’s safety. I would expect an institution of this kind to have somewhat stricter rules, at the very least. Sonia Alfano,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have studied the anti-corruption package presented by the Commission in June extremely carefully, and I have to say that I am impressed with the content of the package. It is a good starting point, and all the European institutions, especially the European Parliament, must strive to achieve real, measurable results quickly. Today corruption is the main route by which organised crime penetrates the legal economy and the public sector. Corruption creates criminal systems, and dangerous connections between entrepreneurs, politicians and public officials. It is estimated that the cost of corruption in Europe is some EUR 120 billion. I have to say that this is a conservative estimate given that in my country, Italy, alone, corruption accounts for EUR 60 billion a year, practically the amount of a financial package that at the moment would save my country from default. With regard to the June communication and the proposals presented, I would like to ask the Commission what measures it intends to propose to improve the fight against corruption in the private sector. Can it give us some details about how it intends to improve financial investigations? What measures does it intend to propose to combat political corruption, and what point have the assessments of the review of the tender directive to combat conflicts of interest and of the draft directive for regulating concessions reached? As Mr Albrecht has already said, this Parliament and these institutions have already been working on equally important problems, such as terrorism, for some time. This directive, the directive on corruption, gives ample space and visibility, and above all it gives us the chance to consider and to understand once and for all the extent to which organised crime is firmly entrenched in all 27 Member States. In any case, Commissioner, this is what you said exactly one year ago, and these answers are crucial for us, especially considering the fact that in a month’s time we will be voting on the report on organised crime in Europe, for which I am the rapporteur. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment of the Frontex Regulation, on which we are voting today, is designed to strengthen the European Agency, endowing it with greater operational capabilities and strengthening the enforcement of the fundamental rights of refugees and asylum seekers but, above all, the ban on refoulement. The creation of a fundamental rights officer role within the Frontex Management Board and the requirement for Member States to show solidarity with each other are steps in that direction. The reform of Frontex must enable us to tackle the real migration-related emergencies in Europe. Only today, the Financial Times
 reports that approximately 85% of the 104 000 migrants who entered the EU illegally in 2010 arrived via Greece, and not via Italy or Malta, and unfortunately the same will be true in 2012. Only if Frontex fully respects migrants’ human rights and helps to prevent the huge number of deaths in the Mediterranean, which has now become a burial ground in which the lives and hopes of people fleeing poverty, oppression and desperation are extinguished, will we be able to say that we are on the right track. This must be Frontex’s goal, and the European Parliament will have to monitor the progress made in this regard. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Ms Hautala and Ms Sargentini on their excellent work. Through the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, transparency has become a basic right of European citizens. We are on the right track, but unfortunately, even in this day and age, there is great resistance when we talk about transparency. In my opinion, there is no middle way: anyone against full transparency obviously has something to hide and would prefer for decisions to be taken out of sight from citizens and the press. The Commission refuses to accept the proposals to revise the regulation on access to documents, which were put forward by Parliament in the report by Mr Cashman and provide for greater transparency. The Council, meanwhile, systematically refuses to make the identities of Member States known during discussions and votes in their meetings. The legal services of the Commission, the Council and Parliament continue to use excuses to hide their legal opinions, despite the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the Turco
 case. Even in Parliament, there is substantial resistance to guaranteeing access to information for citizens, particularly with regard to the activities of Members and the expenditure of this House and its Members. The so-called Galvin report has finally been published, though unfortunately, the names are missing from it. I believe that transparency is one of democracy’s basic tools for combating abuses of power, waste and corruption, and for forging closer relationships between citizens and institutions. In my view, the report by Ms Hautala and Ms Sargentini works along these same lines and hence it deserves the maximum support. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I shall be voting in favour of this report. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday 60 000 Italians demonstrated in Val di Susa against the absurd project to build the Lyon-Turin high-speed rail link (‘TAV’). As an MEP I condemn all forms of violence, whether the violence of the rioters who created disorder yesterday or the violence of the Italian members of parliament and ministers who today tried to liken the peaceful ‘No TAV’ people to the ‘Black Bloc’. Everyone knows that the high-speed rail link in Val di Susa will never be built. Can an area be militarised for 20 years? This is the result of failing to listen to the people and should be a lesson to the EU. Works are done with the citizens for the citizens, not for party political committees on the left and right. The deadlines imposed by the Commission for the provision of the European contribution, amounting to EUR 662 million, have expired. Mr Kallas should decide to withdraw the funding immediately. With these extensions, Italy is enjoying privileges not granted to other Member States. Therefore, I urge the Committee on Petitions to send a delegation to Val di Susa as soon as possible to establish what is happening and listen to local people. The European Parliament should not abandon these citizens and their arguments. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is the first instrument implemented in the European Union that puts into practice the principle of mutual recognition of criminal judgments. That instrument is fundamentally important now and should remain so, especially for fighting mafia groups and organised crime. In the report on organised crime, for which I am the rapporteur in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we are proposing a series of considerations and requests concerning the European Arrest Warrant. One of the main requests is for the EAW to be strengthened and better enforced by the Member States, bearing in mind the requirements and the specific nature of the fight against organised crime. I therefore ask the Commission how it intends to proceed and whether it intends to submit a proposal to remove the Member States’ discretion in the transposition of Articles 3 and 4 of the framework decision, concerning the grounds for mandatory non-execution and optional non-execution. With regard to the grounds for optional non-execution, I also ask whether it may not be appropriate to restrict them in the case of offences typically attributable to organised crime, including the offence of association with a mafia organisation, for which double criminality should not apply anyway.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before the vote, I should like to take a few moments to remind the House, the Council and the European Commission that two years ago, there was an earthquake in L’Aquila in which 309 people died and over 1 650 people were injured. Now I have raised the matter, I will send all MEPs today a video that was filmed in L’Aquila on 13 January. I urge all colleagues to look at it because the citizens of L’Aquila are waiting for a strong response from Europe. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask my fellow Member if thousands of deaths are not a matter to think over and reflect on for a long time, seeing as she just said that we do not have sufficient reason to believe that nuclear power is dangerous.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the emergency situation is teaching the European policy on asylum and immigration a serious lesson It is again evident that the EU does not have a legislative and operational framework that enables it to cope with extraordinary but not unforeseeable events, such as the events of recent months in North Africa. Lampedusa, Italy and Southern Italy are paying for these mistakes, but the main ones to pay are the refugees who are received in such an inhumane manner. Despite Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and the principle of equitable sharing of solidarity, all the countries are actually concerned only with their own affairs and the attitude of France, which shares a border with Italy, is unacceptable in the current European scenario. In this regard, I urge the Commission to consider the possibility of seeking an explanation from the French Government. For years, the EU has entered into agreements with third countries run by dictatorships, funding their activities and putting business interests before democratic requirements. Europe has remained silent before the Libyan raids: does it also intend to remain silent in the face of the unsustainable situation of the tent camps? Of course, we all agree that we cannot make deals with Colonel Gaddafi, yet, a few months ago, I did not hear any objections to the Italy-Libya treaty, which has led to the immigration issue being addressed in the most inhuman way. Today, President Berlusconi tried to use the same approach with Tunisia, offering money. Perhaps, though, the new Tunisian Government has learned its lesson. Yet, like it or not, it is the responsibility of the EU and the 27 Member States to take action, bearing in mind the overriding priority of international solidarity and the protection of human rights. For this reason, I hope that the European Commission proposes the introduction of the emergency procedure laid down in Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection as soon as possible, and that this proposal is adopted by the Council in the near future, because otherwise it will be in vain. I also call for a parliamentary delegation, not a delegation of political groups, to be sent to Lampedusa to verify both the humanitarian conditions of the immigrants and the non-refoulement
 principle. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to speak before you highlighted Parliament’s determination to call for the resignation of the other MEP, the last MEP, who has not yet resigned. I thank you and thank Parliament for making a firm and determined decision to implement a zero-tolerance policy because this is all about the credibility of everyone in this House, and above all we must remember that we represent 500 million citizens and not the lobbies, thank you.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as some have said, Baroness Ashton, you have shown great courage by taking the bull by the horns in this case, but I think there are a number of basic steps to be taken. Meanwhile, you have spoken about bringing the guilty parties to justice. Let us call them by their real name: we need to bring Mr Gaddafi to justice. You also spoke about violence. Instead, I think it is right to say that genocide is taking over in these territories, yet again. We cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand. I think the first thing we need to do is to recognise the Libyan National Council, a transitional council. We must have an interlocutor; we cannot carry on speaking only of sharply reduced humanitarian aid. There is no doubt that we must all speak up for a no-fly zone. We cannot continue accepting the vetoes of China and Russia, countries that are run by dictators. China censors the Internet while Russia kills journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya. I think that right now, the first thing to do is to begin setting out our stall and recognise the Libyan National Council. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that events in the Middle East have made it clear to the European institutions that they cannot continue to ignore the violation of fundamental rights and of national constitutions. Please forgive me but I must again report a shameful action by the ruling majority in Italy, which would like to save Mr Berlusconi from the trials that have just begun over serious crimes such as extortion and exploitation of child prostitution. The Italian majority, in fact, called on the Constitutional Court to decide which court should try Mr Berlusconi. Certainly, the Constitutional Court will throw out the request of a judge on a personal basis, but we must not continue to ignore Mr Berlusconi’s umpteenth attack on Italian democracy and the independence of the Italian judiciary. Many colleagues have already signed a petition to send out a strong signal that will reach the Italian people from their own MEPs. It is a curious coincidence, Mr President, that while Mr Berlusconi has been attacking the judiciary for years, the Minister for Justice, Mr Alfano, has ingenuously come to Strasbourg to describe the plan for making justice efficient and cannot find a single moment to meet the European Parliament. Perhaps he is afraid to face uncomfortable questions from the representatives of the people concerning the Italian justice system and the way people are trying to destroy its independence?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so immediately willing and far-sighted in offering Italy assistance, although the assistance was rejected in the first instance by the Italian Government itself. Commissioner, you have rightly stressed the need to support Tunisia at this time of democratic transition. However, I wonder, and I ask you all: what has happened to the money that Europe has been pouring into Tunisia all these years and which it is still pouring into Libya, which – as we know – are democratic regimes? Therefore, it is now wonderful and amazing to cheer this awakening of the Tunisian people, although I wonder how on earth all that money was ever granted. If the Libyans woke up tomorrow, what conclusion would we draw from that? Would we have thought yet again that we had been funding democratic regimes, only to realise the next day that we had been implementing a disastrous policy instead? I ask myself, Commissioner, how on earth Europe has kept quiet about this democratic awakening, while only the United States has offered strong guidance in this respect. I would like to pick up on what Mr Portas and Mr Tavares said. They pointed out, extraordinarily, that in countries like Tunisia, emigration is viewed as a crime. To begin with, regarding all the people who have landed on Lampedusa – and I would remind Mr Madlener that they are not Libyans but Tunisians, although that is hardly important because Libyans will soon be arriving as well – who will decide whether they are refugees or not, given that a situation of extreme confusion reigns in Tunisia at the moment? Above all, however, how will we feel if we repatriate these people, in the knowledge that they will be thrown into prison as soon as they arrive? These, then, are the points that I believe we should be thinking about, and, above all, we should realise that racist policies like those implemented by the Italian Government have unfortunately produced only highly negative results. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is barely credible for the European institutions to still want to conclude a framework agreement with a dictatorship like Libya. We cannot go on saying that Libya has very important trading relations with European Union Member States and acts as a partner for the European Union in the Mediterranean basin, and putting respect for human rights as a secondary issue. The primary condition for us to be able to start a credible dialogue with Libya is for that country to ratify the Geneva Convention. We cannot barter economic interests for human lives: not just the lives of Libyan citizens, but also of people from other countries who are fleeing civil wars and religious persecution and pass through Libya only to find death and horrendous torture. We have a duty not to forget the thousands of calls for help made by people held in Libyan prisons. We cannot forget the horrors that Gandufa prison revealed to us. Libyan citizens do not enjoy many political and civil rights, such as freedom of expression, assembly and association. The oral amendment by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which seeks to replace the term ‘treaty’ in recital B with ‘agreements between Italy and Libya on joint coastal patrols’ is absolutely unacceptable, and the Italian delegation from Italia dei Valori
 will vote against it. The agreement between Italy and Libya is much more complex: it is a treaty with precise conditions regarding more complex issues than joint coastal patrols. For the European Parliament to remain credible, it needs to call a spade a spade, even if that may be embarrassing. A separate discourse needs to be entered into for the UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency, which is unable to carry out its work in Libya and is accused by the Libyan regime of incredible abuses and crimes. Are these the bases on which agreements should be conducted? We cannot deal with either terrorists or dictators. We are the European Parliament, not the board of directors of an economic giant.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, Directive 2001/77/EC lays down the definition of renewable energy sources with the aim of identifying those for which public incentives may be provided. Renewable energy sources exclude the incineration of the non-biodegradable part of waste. Since 1992, Italy has provided incentives by increasing its citizens’ energy bills and building incinerators, which are scientifically proven to be bad for people’s health and the environment and which the European Union has thus classified as a residual integrated waste management option. Two infringement procedures have been launched with regard to these incentives and, despite formal legislative intervention, in Italy, waste incineration is still being encouraged as a source of renewable energy, with the Acerra case being just one example of this. I realise that it may be difficult for you to remember the details of the situation concerning the CIP 6, which is why I have submitted a written question. However, I would ask you to confirm that incentives may not be provided for the incineration of non-biodegradable waste as a source of renewable energy and that there are no derogations in place for this. I would also like to know whether it is not considered inconsistent for the Waste Directive to establish incineration as a residual waste disposal option, while Directive 2001/77/EC encourages it as a form of renewable energy. Does the Commission intend to review this matter? Sonia Alfano,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the Italian Government’s propaganda, which was soon disproved by the Commission, the waste crisis in Campania is a structural problem that is anything but resolved. Questionable lists aside, we need to realise one thing: the people of Campania continue to live – and die – surrounded by waste. The local, regional and national politicians, on the right and on the left, have an enormous responsibility. The task of solving the problem cannot be offloaded on to the citizens, who are already suffering from completely unhealthy living conditions. The European Union must insist that a worthy solution is found, or else its intervention will have been in vain. The construction of incinerators, which, by the way, are financed as renewable energy sources and thereby infringe current European legislation, will not solve the issue. The waste would be turned into ash, causing harmful and deadly emissions. Pursuant to the Waste Directive, incinerators shall be the last option in a hierarchy of integrated waste systems that presents virtuous alternatives that have no public health or environmental impact but instead create employment. As far as Mafia infiltration is concerned, I feel it should be acknowledged that, while Mafia infiltration, particularly in the field of waste, does happen in the south, it happens primarily in the north. This has been especially true over the last few years. I therefore have three questions for the Commission: what action does it intend to take to ensure that the solution to the problem does not affect people’s health, and how does it intend to prevent decisions from being imposed on the public and areas from actually becoming militarised? Does it think that the immediate launch of a cancer registry for the entire region should be one of the conditions for closing the infringement procedure? What is the Commission’s assessment of Law No 210 of 2008 and, in particular, of Article 9 on incentives for the construction of incinerators, in which European legislation on State aid is clearly infringed?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a number of years, many families in Italy and just as many Romanian children have been suffering the consequences of Romania’s block on international adoptions. The Hague Convention is the benchmark framework to be implemented uniformly in all countries of the European Union, and Romania needs to make an effort to adjust to it. If Romania believes that the block on international adoptions works to protect children – for example, from the risk that a market for the illegal trafficking of children would be created – it must also deal with this problem with the help of the European Union, by toughening up controls and introducing strict regulations. However, we need to make an effort to ensure that many respectable families can adopt children, who deserve a second chance for a happy childhood. I would therefore ask the Commission how it intends to support a possible commitment from Romania to remove the moratorium on international adoptions and, furthermore, I should like to know the Commission’s position on the possibility of creating a European adoption agency, including in the light of the studies carried out.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 and 14 January, a referendum was held at the Fiat plant at Mirafiori in which both blue- and white-collar workers were asked to vote for or against the recovery plan for the plant in Turin. The plan is based on a new collective agreement that undermines workers’ fundamental rights relating to illness and strike action, and even the midday break during eight hours’ work on an assembly line. The referendum is illegitimate because the chief executive officer, Mr Marchionne, has threatened workers that if the agreement is rejected, the business is likely to abandon manufacturing in Italy and move elsewhere. This strategy of fear, of unbridled capitalism without consideration for rules or rights, was supported by the government and even by much of the Democratic Party, an opposition party that has its roots in the Italian Communist Party. The only unions to oppose the agreement were the Italian Federation of Metalworkers (FIOM) and the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL), and they were ousted from the union representation. In any case, the referendum passed with just 54% of the votes. As a result of this agreement, workers’ rights in Italy have slipped back several decades. Europe should know this and bear it in mind.

 I think it was a good idea for the Commission to attend Parliament today to report on the ban on the use of unenriched cages for laying hens, which will enter into force from January 2012. The implementation data are not very encouraging and, hence, very tough action is required against Member States that, out of indolence, have not made any progress for a while. The prohibition of these cages has been known since 1999, and those Member States that joined later were perfectly aware of having to take action on this issue according to precise timescales. Delay is unacceptable. Deadlines must be respected to make the European Union’s actions credible. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union requires the EU to enforce its policies, bearing in mind the welfare of animals as sentient beings. We must not always hide behind the problem of competitiveness, which should not be considered as an issue of quantity and prices but, above all, of quality, environmental sustainability and ethics, too. The critical and aware consumer must be at the heart of a new economic model that the EU should spearhead. I therefore hope that the Commission will proceed swiftly and determinedly to implement Council Directive 1999/74/EC, to protect both animals and consumers. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been following the legislative procedure for the European citizens’ initiative very closely and I am happy – partly on the basis of the statements by the Council and the Commission – that the first petitions will be launched a year from now. I am also proud to be able to announce to the European Parliament that in Italy a broad grassroots movement of citizens, associations and committees has sprung up in the wake of the approval of the outrageous directive on animal research. This movement will not sit on its hands this year, but will work to prepare a proposal for the Commission: a proposal to give the European Union modern and civilised laws and that says ‘no’ to animal testing – a cruel and scientifically ineffective practice – while strongly encouraging alternative methods. Saying ‘no’ to vivisection must be an objective of the European Union, since it is a desire of its citizens. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is well known that the activities of the Italian Government represent a constant violation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We only need to think of the agreement between Italy and Libya, which succeeded in infringing dozens of articles of the Charter, or the proposed ‘bavaglio
’ law that set out to gag the press and the legal system. We are talking about a government supported by a parliament elected in an undemocratic manner, without allowing citizens the chance to express a preference, a government that yesterday won a vote of confidence with votes from the opposition benches from Members of Parliament who publicly admitted that they had been approached with promises of standing at future elections and cash for votes. (The speaker was interrupted by a heckler)
 The facts prove that corruption has taken place. This is business as usual for the corruptor Mr Berlusconi, as the final judgments handed down in the Mondadori and Mills cases reveal. (Do not tell me the European Parliament is letting fishwives in now?)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union cannot back down from the energy challenge that will decide the fate of the planet. We must dispel the myth that the economic development of a country is closely tied to an increase in energy consumption. Europe must pioneer a new sustainable economic model, based on lower use of resources, including energy, with greater productivity. We must therefore break the link between economic growth and an increase in energy sold to industries and the public and instead link it to an increase in energy services that create employment and energy efficiency. For these reasons, I believe that energy efficiency represents a priority for the future of the EU, in both economic and environmental terms, and I hope that the Commission will immediately take the necessary measures to implement the binding objectives that Parliament established today.

 Mr President, notwithstanding the European Convention on Human Rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union and the national constitutions, serious violations of human rights persist on a daily basis in the European Union and in the Member States. In my country – Italy – there is a regime in force in which freedom of the press is violated, political parties take part in elections by submitting fake signatures, State secrecy covers up violent attacks (including by the Mafia), our Prime Minister – though not for much longer, we hope – profits from international cooperation with regimes like those in Russia and Libya, as was also confirmed by WikiLeaks. The European Union cannot allow itself to turn a blind eye to all of this. For these reasons, I support the report, which contains many of the amendments submitted by me and approved in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Amongst these, I should like to single out paragraphs 20 and 40, which call for human rights violations to be monitored and penalised, and for national legislative proposals with the potential to violate human rights to be frozen before they become law, until the EU approves them. I also supported the incentive to use Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union to address human rights violations and to bolster the mandate of the Agency for Fundamental Rights. The report makes numerous positive references to minorities, rights, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, immigrants and asylum seekers, freedom of the press and social rights. For these reasons, I would urge my fellow Members to vote in favour of the report. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciate the work carried out by the two rapporteurs. However, the problem with this draft directive is that it is based on the most usual kind of stalking, in which a person has been a victim of violence by another and therefore must be defended against a repeat of whatever physical or mental abuse took place. Obviously, this is a matter of fundamental importance for hundreds of thousands of women in the European Union and therefore I fully support its content. Unfortunately, however, these measures do not take into account the victims of organised crime who, in the majority of cases, do not need to be defended from an identified or identifiable person, but from organisations against which a restraining order certainly cannot be applied. Therefore, I think that the European Parliament should regard this directive as a first step in implementing the Stockholm Programme, which talks expressly about measures to protect the victims of criminal activity, and it seems to me that Mrs Jiménez and Commissioner Reding are of the same mind. I appeal to the European Commission to ensure that the package of measures to protect victims, which is planned for 2011, also protects victims of organised crime and victims injured in the course of duty on a European level.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that, in the final version of the report, involvement in criminal organisations for offences relating to the trafficking of human beings is an aggravating factor that doubles the minimum penalties from five to ten years in prison. In addition, Article 6a makes explicit reference to the seizure and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds from this kind of offence. This approach – which I believe is absolutely right and I hope may also be carried over to other legislation – looks the facts in the face and recognises that the trafficking of people for various forms of exploitation, such as, for example, prostitution, criminal activities and organ trafficking, is carried out by international criminal organisations. I am also pleased with the provisions of Article 7, which directs Member States not to prosecute people for their involvement in criminal activities that they have been compelled to commit as victims of trafficking. Often, in fact, those who suffer the violence of trafficking not only suffer injuries, but also the insult of being incriminated for doing what they were compelled to do, prostitution being a typical example. Therefore, I support the report and I should like to thank the two rapporteurs. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 There is nothing more inhuman than exploiting the lives of other living beings for profit, infringing every fundamental right. Trafficking in human beings is one of the basest activities in history; it is a widespread and highly complex phenomenon. I am pleased that Parliament has approved at first reading the proposal for a directive on trafficking in human beings. This is a significant step forward in combating the phenomenon, which is the main activity of a large number of international criminal organisations. The most important point is the recognition that organised crime is the main problem to tackle. The EU is finally making a real, explicit distinction between crime and organised crime, because the latter is a truly separate issue. There are many other positive elements such as a broader definition of exploitation, greater protection for victims and the rule stipulating that victims of trafficking shall not be charged for crimes they have been forced to commit as a result of violence or the threat of violence against them. As Amnesty International points out, often women who are victims of trafficking are arrested for prostitution, or are not guaranteed full access to justice. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 As the statements by the government representatives of numerous States demonstrate, the extraordinary zeal with which Julian Assange is being investigated is clearly designed to punish him and WikiLeaks for having revealed certain top secrets to the world, such as the concerns of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who asked the US embassies in Rome and Moscow for information on any personal investments of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Putin that might influence the foreign or economic policies of their respective countries. Mr Berlusconi is described as Mr Putin’s spokesman in Europe. Clearly, what is taking place here is the unprecedented punishment and persecution of a man and an organisation whose only crime is to have made the world aware of certain grey areas that put governments in an uncomfortable position. Hence, it is our duty to protect the freedom of WikiLeaks and to guarantee fair treatment for Julian Assange, who should pay for his crimes, if proven, in a fair trial. I therefore call on the Commission to state its position on the WikiLeaks affair and to explain how it intends to monitor the situation so that this affair is not used to clamp down on freedom of information and to impose restrictions on the Internet, which has once again proved to be an exceptionally powerful democratic instrument, and which must therefore be protected.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the energy efficiency policies implemented so far by the various Member States for 2020 will not enable us to achieve the target of a 20% reduction in energy consumption; we will be lucky to manage 10%, which is a decidedly disappointing result. If energy consumption continues to increase, achieving the 20% renewable energy target may also be in jeopardy, since that target is calculated as a proportion of the EU’s final energy consumption. I am firmly in favour of setting a binding target for energy efficiency also, so as to ensure that Europe’s climate and energy policies are mutually reinforcing. Unfortunately, the facts suggest that counting on the goodwill of individual Member States is not going to work. The European Union must show the way with clear and effective policies and objectives. Let us stop investing in new facilities to produce more energy, and let us plough our money and our efforts into the cleanest energy in the world, energy that we can avoid using. Lastly, I call for the adoption of Amendment 2, which calls on the Commission to launch an initiative on the energy performance of existing buildings in 2011. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 18 December 1990, the UN adopted the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. This Convention is one of the UN’s nine main instruments on human rights. Unfortunately, 20 years later, none of the Member States of the European Union have signed or ratified that Convention. I believe that recognising the rights of third-country nationals who live and work legally in the European Union must be a priority for a Europe which faces new challenges in relation to integration, non-discrimination and protection of human rights. For this reason, I ask all Members to support Amendment 16 and to sign Written Declaration 96 – to which I am a signatory, together with Cornelia Ernst, Sylvie Guillaume and Franziska Keller – in order to petition Member States to ratify the UN Convention on migrant workers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the Belet report because it recognises and specifies the fundamental role played by public sector broadcasting in Europe. I see this as an important step for Parliament, which is clearly stating that public broadcasting needs to remain independent of political power. This report seems to have been written specially for Italy, where the RAI is now at an advanced stage of decomposition because it has been taken over completely by party politics, to the detriment of the cultural and informational depth of public broadcasting and, hence, of the entire country. Just look at what happened last week on the programme called ‘Vieni via con me’ (‘Come away with me’). The Minzolinis and Masis of broadcasting, professionals of public disinformation and their paymasters, are incompatible with the report that Parliament has adopted today. The European Union should take note and act accordingly. We want no more party politics on the RAI! Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of information about prescription-only medicinal products is a sensitive subject because it has an important effect on the protection of the right to health and welfare of all citizens. The European Commission sent us a proposal on the revision of the directive that risked opening a loophole in the legislation, which would have allowed pharmaceutical companies to exploit an unclear distinction between the definitions of information and advertising to promote their prescription-only medicinal products, to the detriment of the people. Of course, there is still much to do with regard to a suitable strategy for information on medicinal products, but fortunately this time the European Parliament has reacted as it always should. Parliament has taken a stand to protect citizens and defend a patient’s right to better information, and it has not given in to pressure from pharmaceutical companies. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Evans on the recast of the directive because I really regret the fact that in the compromise text, which was adopted due to strong pressure from industrial lobbies, all references to PVC and halogenated fire retardants have disappeared, even though all the studies carried out by the Commission have demonstrated since as far back as 2000 that the disposal of these substances poses serious risks for human health and the environment. Transferring the costs of industry to the environment and to citizens is an approach that we absolutely cannot support because, in addition to distorting the free market, it represents an unacceptable trade-off between peoples’ quality of life and the profits of business. I hope the next time the directive is updated, in three years’ time, that citizens' right to health and environmental protection will be placed right at the forefront. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have read the report carefully and I endorse it overall. However, I was left rather puzzled by various references to the future of coal in the European strategy, in particular in paragraph 52, in which the Commission is asked to draw up legal provisions to facilitate the building of coal-fired electric power plants. Several years ago in the United States, a political and citizens’ movement was started which has de facto 
led to a sort of moratorium on the building of coal-fired power plants. As well as CO2
 emissions, this decision is also based on the problem of dealing with the ash, which contains many toxic substances. Therefore, I absolutely do not support the defence of coal-fired power plants and I would note that so called ‘clean coal is, in many cases, more of a slogan than a reality. I have also heard several fellow Members fiercely defend nuclear energy, in terms of both costs and safety. Unfortunately, whoever says this shows that they do not know what they are talking about. Alternatives exist, they are renewable, they are genuine, and the European Union must plot its path for the coming decade in that direction. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciate the presence of Commissioner Hedegaard and the stance she has taken. I should like to thank you for your commitment to keeping Parliament continually updated on the developments for Cancún. The fight against climate change must be conducted on a global level and with everyone’s involvement, but the idea that our position must depend on that of other countries is irresponsible and does not do justice to the role that the EU has set itself, namely a leading role in guiding cultural revolutions at a global level, primarily the fight against climate change. We must set ourselves ever more ambitious targets and ensure that they are reached by the various Member States. I therefore thank the Commissioner for having reminded Italy, a few days ago, to maintain its financial promises of EUR 200 million to combat climate change. Unfortunately, I must inform the Commission that the Italian Government’s budget does not seem to provide for these funds at the moment. I would therefore ask the Commission to use all the powers available to it to make the Member States keep their promises, particularly when it is a matter of such a significant battle for the near future of the people of the world ...

 Madam President, the disaster of April 2010 is one of the most serious environmental disasters ever to have happened in the world. If the same thing happened within a closed sea such as the Mediterranean, the lives of tens of millions of European and non-European citizens would be threatened, with no way back. Yet in Italy – as Lega Ambiente
 protested with regard to an ill-conceived energy policy – we are seeing an extraordinary increase in research applications and permits granted by the ministry for identifying and extracting oil resources that would be sufficient to cover the Italian energy requirement for little more than one year. It is obvious that the sacrifice is not worth it. All this is compounded by concern over the fact that BP has announced an agreement with Libya for offshore extraction just under 500 km south of Sicily. I hope that the Commission undertakes, through this now imminent measure, to defend life in the Mediterranean against the attacks of multinationals and governments who are complicit and care little about our collective welfare.

 Madam President, I would like to report to Parliament that last Sunday, during the Pope’s visit to Palermo, the Italian Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union were suspended. Freedom of expression and of thought and the inviolability of private homes were trampled over. On this occasion, the Italian police insisted on the removal of a banner bearing a phrase from the Gospel: ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves’, while the same police force put up posters that were homophobic and against common-law couples. Inside the bookshop Altro quando
, the owner had put up a banner bearing the phrase ‘I love Milingo’. The police entered the private premises and seized the banner without any court warrant and using methods that were unedifying even by their own standards. It is paradoxical that in a lay and democratic State, as Italy is supposed to be, public freedom of expression is suppressed by the authorities in order not to offend the papal sensibilities, while Prime Minister Berlusconi is able to swear in public without this representing a problem for the Church. On this occasion, all the lay and religious institutions yet again rode roughshod over democracy in Italy, increasing the unbridgeable gap that has now emerged between institutions and the public. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Saturday, the Italian newspaper Il fatto quotidiano
 published a document signed by the Mafioso former mayor of Palermo, Vito Ciancimino, in which he wrote that Marcello Dell’Utri and Silvio Berlusconi were cut from the same cloth as him; that they belonged to the same mafia-dominated political system. This news comes to the attention of the magistracy as the truth emerges about the mafia massacres of 1992, which saw the deaths of judges Falcone and Borsellino, namely, the State negotiated with the mafia for the end of the ‘season of bombs’ and this favoured, as appears to be the case, the establishment of the Prime Minister’s party, Forza Italia
, which was indeed founded with the help of Dell’Utri, sentenced to seven years for mafia association and still a senator in the Italian Parliament. In the light of this and in the light of the recent murder of Mayor Angelo Vassallo by the Camorra, I reiterate the importance of the request made by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which, as a result of my continual pressure, has once again asked the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for a report on organised crime at European Union level. Europe cannot continue to turn the other cheek for fear of tackling a problem which is no longer local but globalised, and which right now closely affects the government of a Member State. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, under Rule 175 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, I call for this document to be referred back to committee. We have been waiting for this directive for a great many years but, as has been stressed in several other speeches, there are some items that need to be thoroughly amended in order to ensure adequate protection for animals. Adoption of this legislation will allow for experimentation for teaching purposes and the reuse of the same animal several times, even in procedures that cause it to suffer. It will not in any way encourage alternative methods that are considered scientifically valid. This is not a matter of adopting an extreme position, but rather of respecting Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which requires us to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals since they are sentient beings. We do not want to hold back research, but rather to encourage it along an ethically sustainable course. It is unacceptable to say that we can adopt this directive now and amend it in the years to come. We should take responsibility for making the necessary corrections to it now. This is not a political or ideological position; it is common sense, and common sense has no political hue. Sonia Alfano,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all unfortunately aware of the information situation in Italy. We are classified as a partly free country by Freedom House and occupy 71st place along with the islands of Tonga, ranking only just above East Timor. The ‘gagging law’ is only the latest development in an overall situation in which the country’s democratic defences are being greatly weakened, in particular, due to the lack of free information. As the OECD indicates in its most recent report, the disintegration of democracy and of the vested rights to information and free expression is unfortunately spreading throughout Europe. We need only think of France, with its government-appointed top public television service executive, or Hungary, Estonia and Romania, which, after taking tough legal action to limit freedom of expression, are making it impossible for information to play its essential democratic role as government watchdog. For this reason, I believe it is the Commission’s duty to make a strong, consistent commitment to defending media and information freedom, in line with the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. I therefore ask the Commission what action it intends to take to promote genuine media pluralism in the EU Member States and, in particular, when it will issue the communication on indicators for media pluralism, which was promised for 2010, together with the associated legislative proposal. I would not like to think that, as with the expulsion of the Roma in France, the Commission is tempted to give up its defence of freedom and democracy in Europe in order to cover up the work of Member State governments, which are increasingly concerned with hiding their wrongdoings from the press and the public. I hope that you, and also Commissioner Reding, will be able to reassure me on this point. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with you, Mr President, that it is the European Union’s duty to play a fundamental role in international issues and that we must speak with one, strong voice. It is most certainly our responsibility to intervene promptly and decisively each time human rights are oppressed, no matter where in the world that happens. I hope that the next six months of the Belgian Presidency will be distinguished by an unwavering commitment on those issues. To demonstrate that commitment, I ask for immediate attention to be paid to what is happening in certain Libyan prisons in the Sahara Desert: 250 Eritrean citizens, including women and children, have been shut up for days in inhumane conditions, in violation of all international regulations on human rights and asylum. Many of these citizens were denied political refugee status, even though they met all the necessary requirements. The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Frattini, actually accused the European Union of not even having published a press release. I think now is the time for the European Union to speak with one, strong voice. Right now, we must not turn our heads and look the other way, because 250 people are asking us to save them from death.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to bring to the attention of the European Union the fate of 250 Eritreans who are now sending appeals for help by text message, as they are being detained in the Sahara Desert by the Libyan authorities.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the right to petition is one of the main instruments available to European citizens for active participation in the political activities of the European Union. In approaching my mandate as an MEP in the spirit of service and respect for the citizen, and the priority that this must have in the decisions of the European Parliament, I have often taken an interest in the petitions submitted ... (The President asked the speaker to speak more slowly)
 I have often taken an interest in the petitions submitted and in their progress in the relevant committee. Unfortunately, despite the fact that Parliament’s Rules of Procedure stipulated, in Rule 5(3), that Members shall be entitled to inspect any files held by Parliament or a committee, I have discovered that the internal e-Petition 
database is only accessible to members of the relevant committee. I contacted the committee in question but, unfortunately, did not receive a response. I think that this discrimination, which reduces the importance of citizen’s petitions and undermines the work of the parliamentary committee, ought to be redressed immediately. We have little time, Mr President, so we try to say everything in one minute. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is undoubtedly a good piece of work and I should like to compliment the rapporteur on it. One of the first phrases of the explanatory statement struck a very positive chord with me, and I would like to quote it directly: ‘waste management policy must transform the EU into a recycling society’. However, I do detect some contradictions there. For example, the fact that separate collection is mandatory as long as it is the best option from both the environmental and economic standpoints. In other words, investments made by Member States in this area are not to be subject to discussion even if they are contrary to European guidelines. In this way, as has already been seen with the framework directive on waste, the European Union will provide little more than a suggestion. Plus, we forget – by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, which the European institutions all too often hide behind – that it is our duty to provide ambitious and incisive responses to the problem of waste. Let us fix targets for separate collection and stipulate their fulfilment. Let us use best practices, like the ‘zero waste’ policies enacted in some parts of the USA and make them binding for all Member States. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Cashman report because I believe it is the responsibility of this House and of the European institutions to abide by and uphold the commitments made to people who live in less developed countries, in particular, the countries of Africa. We cannot get to 2015 and realise that the eight goals that we set ourselves have not been achieved, because behind the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, behind these percentages – let us not forget this – there are billions of people who are suffering and do not have the opportunity to live in dignity. The European Union must set an example and lead the way as far as development assistance is concerned. Public debt cancellation, together with a greater commitment to ensuring that aid is put to good use, is one of the key points of this solidarity-based project, the achievement of which – we have to be aware – cannot be postponed without sacrificing more human lives.

According to a survey published by the Region of Sicily at the end of 2009, 75% of citizens believe that European funds have no positive impact whatsoever, or very little. If we then consider that, according to the Court of Auditors, 51% of resources earmarked to Sicily for the 2000-2006 programming period were not spent and that a good percentage of the funds utilised were blighted by irregularities, we can easily understand the almost total lack of public trust. I therefore fully support the report by my fellow Member. Only total transparency with the aim of ensuring that the public is made aware of the effective use of public resources can restore trust in the institutions. Anyone must be able to know to whom funds are allocated and, above all, to what end they are directed, while also being able to follow all stages from programming to the implementation of interventions. Enabling citizens to monitor European funds not only represents a fundamental manifestation of the democratic process but also constitutes a deterrent to any form of siphoning off of those public resources. I remind you that transparency does not merely mean making documents public: that is only the first step. Information must be accessible and easily intelligible; otherwise, its production will be merely a technical exercise that does not serve the purpose of any democratic control. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me a moment. (The speaker pretends to gag herself for a few seconds, to show that she cannot speak)
 This is what would happen in Italy if a law tabled and approved last week in the Italian Senate, the ‘draft law on wiretapping’, were also to be approved in the Chamber. This decree-law more or less bans journalists, bloggers – everyone – from publishing wiretaps. This is clearly unconstitutional, and is also against the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights which states, in Article 11, that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, as well as to receive and impart information. I would like to use a single example to focus the attention of the European institutions, because this really is an incredible form of censorship. I would like to use an example that is striking, evident and real. My father was a journalist killed by the Mafia and over the last seven years the true circumstances surrounding that Mafia murder have come to light through wiretaps. Through wiretaps, we were able to discover that he died because a fugitive was hiding in the area where we lived. I therefore call the attention of the European institutions to this matter.

 As regards the Ţicău report, I voted in favour of the common position on updating the directive on the energy performance of buildings, because the aim is that, from the end of 2020, all newly constructed buildings will have an energy balance equal to zero, an aim that the European institutions must make every effort to achieve. Europe has a shared commitment, and is firmly convinced that in the near future, it will not be necessary to produce more energy, but to make better use of that which is already produced. Energy saving and energy efficiency effectively represent a source of energy production. We do not need to wait ten years to move in this direction; instead, Member States need to commit as of now to achieving energy efficiency targets, using financial resources that, until today, have been dedicated to producing greater quantities of energy. I remind you especially of the iniquitous launch of the nuclear programme in Italy, which damaged and endangered the health of citizens and the environment. A huge quantity of public resources was wasted on this launch in order to produce, in less than twenty years, the same quantity of energy that we could do without if we were to invest the same resources in energy efficiency right now. Green investments for our children, not radioactive waste! I will now move on to the explanation of vote for the Rühle report. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 I voted in favour because I think it is important for Parliament to support the simplification and rationalisation of public procurement law. This will make work easier both for administrative bodies and for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which will find it easier to participate in tenders. I consider it essential to refer to the use of public procurement as a means of encouraging paths of sustainable development, by introducing environmental and social criteria within invitations to tender. I also think that it is the duty of this Parliament and of the European institutions to continue pressing for all-round transparency surrounding the use of public money, particularly with regard to public procurement, using all possible means and especially the Internet. Citizen control represents a crucial contribution for using public funds in a way that is genuinely in the collective interest and, as the Committee on Regional Development reminds us, for fighting the corruption that prevails within local and regional authorities.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of Parliament’s resolution on the new Digital Agenda for Europe because I believe that guaranteeing easy and affordable broadband access to the entire population is a strategic priority for the European Union. Extending Internet use means broadening and developing citizens’ freedom of expression, favouring their participation in democratic life and permitting the dissemination of knowledge and innovations. What I would like to highlight is that the spread of broadband in Europe would guarantee broader freedom of information. As noted by Eurostat, we must not forget that Europe also has two or possibly three speeds as regards the spread of the Internet. Italy, especially in some regions, as well as Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Portugal, are the least developed States in this sense. It is no accident that in the Freedom of the Press index for 2009 drawn up by Freedom House,
 Italy was listed among the partially free states, in last place in western Europe together with Turkey, and 72nd in the world together with Benin and India and preceded by Tonga. I also hope that thanks to these resolutions and the principles that have been mentioned, the Italian Government will decide to release the investment of EUR 800 million as soon as possible which was intended to break down the digital divide in Italy and which, according to a statement by Gianni Letta, the Deputy Secretary to the Italian Council of Ministers, is not a priority at the moment. I would like to emphasise that the quality of the service in Italy is inadequate for current needs and that for years consumer associations have been complaining that the access costs are among the least competitive in Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 16 people convicted of various types of crime have been elected to the Italian Parliament and, at the last European elections, Italy sent three MEPs who have been convicted by final judgment. There is no law in Europe prohibiting people who have been convicted by final judgment, or who are awaiting further legal proceedings, from standing for election; everything is left to the discretion of the Member States. Italian citizens have come up with the ‘Clean Parliament’ programme. We therefore call on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to amend the Act concerning the election of representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage to make it a condition, in order to stand for election to the European Parliament, not to have any criminal convictions, including those that have not become final. The Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in the last Parliament, Mr Leinen, undertook to do this, but everything was left to his successor, Mr Casini, who has already stated that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will not pursue it. We would point out that not only is this the responsibility of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but that Article 223 (formerly 190) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union actually stipulates that the European Parliament should implement a uniform electoral procedure throughout the European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, my political group. On 5 March, the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, signed an interpretative decree-law, also known as the ‘save list’ decree-law. In fact, this decree allows the rules of the game to be changed after the electoral campaign has started. On the website of the Quirinal Palace, Giorgio Napolitano himself states that, unlike the draft decree proposed to him by the government in a tense meeting on Thursday evening, in his view, the text subsequently drafted by the Ministry of the Interior and the Prime Minister did not present obvious defects of an unconstitutional nature. Article 87(5) of the Italian Constitution lays down that the President of the Italian Republic shall promulgate laws and issue decrees with the force of law, and regulations. The President of the Republic absolutely cannot participate in the drafting of procedures and of decree-laws. The President of the Republic’s predecessor, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, considers it to be an aberrant distortion of our democratic system. It is clear that the government is doing what the constitution prohibits. That decree, Mr President, has changed the rules of the game for an electoral competition that has already begun and allows those who have broken the law to stand, having been readmitted to the electoral competition. I wonder why Parliament is always ready to take a stand against countries that violate laws but does not acknowledge that there is a country among the 27 Member States that is violating laws.

Mr President, if, instead of all this squabbling, we had had the opportunity to take the floor, we perhaps could have also done our electorate a good turn, since it is 10 o’clock in the evening and we all knew that we should have taken the floor. Every one of us comes here to voice the demands of our electorate. One minute of speaking time is already very little, and shortening the list is, in my view, also rather arrogant.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Gas Natural
, a Spanish holding company, has submitted a project for on-shore regasification plants which would affect the Trieste area, and which has been approved by the Italian Ministry of the Environment. The Trieste regasification plant technical board has highlighted some important shortcomings. Following the informal meeting that took place between the European Commission, Italy and Slovenia on 26 January 2010, the Italian Permanent Representative to the European Union publicly speculated that the European Union had approved the project, whilst the official word from Slovenia is that the opposing sides have been called upon to reach an agreement. This accord will probably be difficult to achieve in practice, because of the atypical background to the regasification plant affair. In fact, it turns out that the bodies responsible for providing guarantees and for safety have failed to comply with their protection duties. Significant delays in drawing up external emergency plans and in communicating with public bodies and authorities responsible for managing emergencies have been highlighted, as has a failure to inform the public about the risks of serious accidents concerning codes of conduct, and the absence of an objective assessment of the domino effect caused by a possible accident in high-risk industrial plants. For these reasons, we believe this is yet another attempt to set up a high-risk plant, in the knowledge that there are absolutely no protection and safety measures in place. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw Parliament’s attention to the rules on company transfers contained in Directive 2001/23/EC. I am saying this because Eutelia S.p.A., an Italian company operating in the field of telecommunications and information technology, counts among its clients some very important businesses, but not just businesses: for example, it also provides services for the Bank of Italy, the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Italian Senate. Furthermore, it is involved with the Schengen project, so it manages some very confidential data. In May 2009, Eutelia all but divested itself of its IT branch, transferring it to its subsidiary, Agile, which basically has a fund of only EUR 96 000 to pay its 2 000 employees. Subsequently, in October 2009, 1 192 people received redundancy notices. These people are still employed, despite having received redundancy notices. Moreover, the ridiculous thing is that the rule that I referred to just now imposes specific requirements of entrepreneurship on those who acquire parts of undertakings … (The President cut off the speaker) Sonia Alfano,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the European Crime Prevention Network. This network was set up in 2001 by Council Decision 2001/427/JHA. Its objectives were to facilitate cooperation and exchanges of information and experiences at national and European level; to collect and analyse relevant information aimed in particular at the exchange of best practices; to organise conferences, seminars, meetings and initiatives with the objective of facilitating the exchange of experiences and best practices; and to provide its expertise to the Council and the Commission concerning crime prevention. The Decision envisaged that the structure would be based on contact points designated by the Commission and the Member States; these contact points were to include at least one representative from the national authorities, while the other designated contact points could be researchers or university academics specialising in this field. Member States were, in any case, required to involve researchers, university academics, NGOs and civil society. Even Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction were involved in the work as expert bodies. In 2005, the network underwent its first internal structural reform. This foresaw the permanent establishment of two commissions – one for the work programme and one for research – while the running of the website was transferred from the European Commission to the United Kingdom, which still keeps it updated. In 2007, there was another review, which acknowledged the particular need to strengthen the secretariat and highlighted the need to confront the problem of resources for the permanent commissions and the national representatives. In March 2009, an external evaluation was published concerning the functioning of the network. This focused on the importance of the objectives that brought the network into being but, at the same time, regrettably highlighted the organisational failure that had impeded the achievement of the important objectives that we were speaking of earlier. The problems thus brought to light, which have led to the virtual collapse of the network, included the lack of suitable resources, an ineffective secretariat, lack of commitment on the part of the national representatives and a very poor work programme. The evaluation also considered the possibility of disbanding the network. In consequence, the network appointed a working group to examine the recommendations made in March 2009 and took the view that certain amendments needed to be made to the Act that created the network. In particular, it was suggested that there should be an external secretariat financed with funds from Community programmes. Although some Member States had revived the idea of disbanding the network, others suggested that it should be reformed. The Swedish Presidency of the European Council agreed with this proposal, to the extent of making it a priority in its own six-month term of office. At this point, I must stress how embarrassed I am to see these empty seats, given that these proposals were made by the Swedish Presidency itself. The proposal envisages that the network should be composed of a secretariat, of contact points designated by each Member State and of a board of directors. This board of directors should be made up of national representatives appointed by Member States and would be presided over by a chairman in charge of an executive committee. I think there is also some confusion in this respect between contact points and national representatives. Civil society, the academic world, the world of experience and hence, of experts, are all being completely left out of the network. This is a very serious matter. The structural links between the network and the other Community institutions and bodies that are concerned with crime and its prevention have been completely cut off. The Decision does not envisage any form of cooperation with the European Parliament and the requirement for knowledge of languages has been omitted, despite having been requested previously. Speaking as rapporteur, I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and is incapable of tackling crime prevention for several reasons. First, it has been unable to fulfil the objectives for which it was created; second, there has been no cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Member States, and I believe that this must be regarded as a sort of sabotage of the network itself. Crime prevention cannot be reduced to the exchange of best practices. Unfortunately, we have witnessed what is almost a type of tourism on the part of various officials who have visited various countries and have often not even managed to speak to one another because there were no interpreters. The failure to involve civil society and NGOs, or to develop materials on prevention such as books for schools, makes this network completely ineffective. To make the network function, I think we should strengthen its powers, and also incorporate the fight against crime and the prevention of organised crime. I therefore suggest that we reject this proposal, which could have been accepted only if the Council had presented a genuinely ambitious proposal. Unfortunately, this has not happened. Sonia Alfano,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Members who have taken part in this debate. I should, in particular, also like to thank Mr Barrot for having taken our concerns on board. Our proposed rejections are not unjustified: they are not intended as a simple ‘no’ to the Council. On the contrary, we should like to be involved, given that the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force within a few days, and I consider that Parliament’s role as colegislator is of fundamental importance. I had personally asked the Council formally to present a much more ambitious proposal on the European Crime Prevention Network and to do so immediately after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This proposal was not presented. Therefore, it proved truly necessary to reject the proposal, and I believe that Parliament has the right to operate on the basis of full codecision, especially regarding such important issues as this. I thank Mr Nicholson for what he said concerning the roles of victims and perpetrators, roles that are too often reversed. In the few months that I have been in Parliament, I have noted that Parliament and the European Union have accorded an extraordinary degree of importance to the fight against terrorism, while sadly there is a lack of will to address not only the fight against crime, but the organised crime that is at the root of it. It is impossible to imagine combating or preventing crime without considering the possibility of a more comprehensive operation to repress and prevent organised crime and the Mafia – as Mr De Magistris has stated, quoting the remarkable words of Judge Falcone, who was murdered by the Mafia. This said, I should like to make a small digression as someone who unfortunately has had first-hand experience of these matters. All too often, there is not only confusion between victim and perpetrator, but there are governments – and sadly the Italian Government has not paid much attention to this matter – which put victims of the same type of crime on a different footing from each other. Victims of terrorism are treated in one way, and victims of the Mafia in another. In my view, these differences and forms of discrimination cannot continue to exist, because such differences have absolutely no place in a Europe that aims to base its policy on innovation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to address the Commissioner, who maintained that it is not the job of this Parliament to resolve certain issues. I would point out, however, that it is the job of this Parliament to ensure that the Treaty and the Member States’ constitutions are respected. A few months ago, the Italian Minister for Justice declared that he had arranged for the imminent closure of some parts of YouTube and the Internet. I would point out that only in China do such things happen. Article 21 of the Italian Constitution decrees that the press may not be subject to authorisation or censorship. As other Members have already confirmed, Italy is the only country in which the Head of Government has a monopoly on public, and now also private, television channels and in which, unfortunately, a law is being passed that will, in fact, prevent journalists from publishing even judicial reports. This is because, were they to be published, Italians would probably learn about Mr Berlusconi’s part in the 1992 massacres, Mafia massacres in which Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino died.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you Mr Barrot and Mr Billström. Back on 31 August, I tabled a priority question to the Commission. It is true that the number of migrants reaching Italian and Libyan shores has fallen, but this is because the number of dead which the Mediterranean Sea continues to receive has risen. Alas, the Mediterranean has now become a mass grave and the Berlusconi Government, to wit, the Italian Government, has signed an agreement with Libya which unfortunately allows Italy to refuse entry not only to migrants, but also refugees from countries where there is persecution or civil war, such as Somalia and Eritrea, and denies these poor people the right to seek asylum, thereby breaching every international rule and the Geneva Convention in particular. I would remind you that non-refoulement is a principle which knows no geographical boundaries and which cannot be haggled over or negotiated under any circumstances. We do not want to continue thinking that ultimately, this Italy-Libya agreement boils down to economic interests worth around EUR 5 000 billion. I demand that the Commission does not – if this is its intention – conclude an EU-Libya agreement similar to the Italian one, as we have seen the results of that despicable agreement. I repeat, alas this agreement forces these people to undergo torture, because this is what we are dealing with: the detention centres to which they are taken in Libya are torture, according to press reports and also photographs, for example, photographs which show many of these immigrants in Ganfuda prison, 10 kilometres from Benghazi. This is torture, which I do not believe is accounted for in any friendship or institutional agreements. As highlighted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the non-refoulement principle prevents people being returned to territories where their lives could be considered to be in danger or their freedom could be threatened. Sending these people back to Libya which, I would again remind you, has neither signed nor ratified the Geneva Convention, seems truly unbelievable. Moreover, to add insult to injury, illegal immigration is a criminal offence in Italy so, for example, after the dramatic landing at the end of August in which many Somalis lost their lives, those few, I think four or five Somalis who managed to reach their destination have, among other things, been accused of immigration and are therefore now being prosecuted under Italian law. I call on the Commission now to take real action, to assess whether the Italy-Libya agreement complies with international law and finally bring about a decisive change of course by not supporting the Italian Government’s nefarious policy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate those who actively contributed to the adoption of the report on the Statute for a European cooperative society. I would like to emphasise the important role of the cooperative experience in Italy and Europe and of its impact on the territory, in particular, during the period of crisis we are currently going through. However, I must regretfully note that the European cooperative society (SCE) is not yet a success, given its scarce use: in 2010, only 17 SCEs were registered. This should make us question the applicability of the legal framework. I believe that today, more than ever, simplification is needed to enable small organisations to access information on national provisions for implementing regulations and directives. Furthermore, I think we need to remember the commitments undertaken by the Commission, in particular, to include cooperatives among the financial instruments of the European Investment Fund and to make explicit reference to more favourable conditions for cooperatives, such as easier access to loans and tax concessions. The Italian experience has shown that if cooperatives are supported by adequate instruments and concessions, they produce excellent results in terms of employment and society. Vincenzo Iovine  (ALDE

Mr President, I was pleased to play a part in approval of the scheme for distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union. At a time like this, when the number of deprived people in Europe has risen as a result also of the economic crisis, I believe that an important signal like today’s can contribute to greater cohesion in the European Union. This reminds me of the example of a Neapolitan saint. He was a doctor called Giuseppe Moscati. When he received patients in his surgery, he used to put his hat on the desk with the sides turned up, and a notice placed on it reading ‘Those who have please give, and those who don’t please take’.Andrea Zanoni,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let us stop ‘finning’! We must put a stop to indiscriminate capture of sharks in order to remove their precious and much sought-after fins before throwing the huge shark bodies back into the sea. There must be an end to exemptions for special permits. This is what Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has asked for in its opinion, on which I acted as rapporteur, which despite some opposition from the Committee on Fisheries, will be approved in full by this House tomorrow. The European Union, in line with the view of the scientific world, decided to outlaw finning in 2003, but the exemptions allowed by the current legislation make it impossible to combat a phenomenon that poses a serious threat to the survival of this particularly vulnerable species. There is no other way to go: only by making it mandatory for fins to be landed still naturally attached to the body can a simple and effective control of the ban on on-board finning be achieved. Encouraging conservation of shark stocks will bring about genuinely sustainable fishing. I therefore call on Parliament to support the proposal. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 2013 will rightly be the Year of European Citizens. This is an important initiative because recalling and enhancing awareness, in particular among young people, of the rights and achievements attached to European citizenship should be treated as an absolute priority. Today, thanks to the process of European integration, EU citizens may live, work, study and travel freely within the territory of the Member States, use the health services, enjoy rights and protection as passengers and consumers, and vote and stand as candidates in elections to the European Parliament and in municipal elections in their Member State of residence. These are important achievements, which bring with them not just a strong symbolic connotation that strengthens and promotes the sense of belonging to Europe, but also undoubted advantages and practical opportunities. However, according to a Eurobarometer report, and as I can confirm on a daily basis in my work as an MEP, there is often a lack of awareness of these rights, and of the values and principles that inspire them. It is therefore essential to make every effort, particularly in the schools but also elsewhere, to raise awareness of and provide information on the great advantages of our dual citizenship, the European aspect of which enhances and strengthens the national aspect.

Madam President, protection of passenger rights is an increasingly important issue, especially at times of crisis such as the present, when transport cost cutting and sudden airline bankruptcy in the sector can cause serious disruption to passengers. All too often we read in the newspapers of cancelled flights and hundreds of passengers left to fend for themselves, sometimes for days on end; not to mention rail delays and cancellations, leaving thousands of workers, students and whole families stranded, often without information on alternative modes of transport to bring them home or to work. Passengers must be guaranteed more price transparency and must be protected against unfair commercial practices, such as the addition of non-optional operational costs and excessive restrictions on hand luggage. Efforts must be made to provide multilingual information points to deal with rerouting and cancellation of flights and trains, in order to provide the best protection possible for European citizens. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, reforming the common fisheries policy is a necessary decision that cannot be put off any longer. We fish too much in Europe, and we often fish badly. If we want to safeguard marine biological resources, conserve the marine ecosystem and ensure the survival of the fisheries sector, we have to give overexploited fish stocks time to recover. However, the view that prevailed in this Chamber today by only a few votes was the blinkered view of those who want to maintain the status quo and continue to condemn our seas and the whole fisheries sector to certain death. That is why I voted against the report on the reform of the common fisheries policy. We need a well-thought-out reform that allows for the sustainable exploitation of marine resources and not a watered-down text that offers no future prospects. We need multiannual management plans and a precise timetable, as well as a network of protected areas. I welcome sanctions against those Member States that do not abide by the rules, carry out inadequate controls, exceed their quotas and do not provide reliable data. Greater protection for the fish in our seas means more jobs for European fishermen, but there are some people in this Chamber who have not yet understood that. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, the current global economic and environmental crisis requires us to make choices to save resources. With the Energy Efficiency Directive adopted today, we can achieve important goals, such as tackling the problem of climate change and the scarcity of fossil fuels, including coal and oil; cutting the annual cost of buying fuel, which amounts to EUR 400 billion, by making a potential saving of EUR 50 billion per year; reducing Europe’s dependency on Russia and OPEC countries, from which we import gas and oil; reducing air pollution, which, in some regions of Europe, currently poses an unfortunately unresolved threat to the health of millions of European citizens; creating new jobs and benefits for small and medium-sized enterprises, including installers and the building sector, which is currently going through a very serious crisis. I therefore welcome the rules introduced for the renovation of public buildings and for four-yearly energy audits, which are compulsory for all large enterprises. This is one of the many steps Europe needs to take. However, we need to do more: we must set ourselves more ambitious targets and take measures that are more binding on all Member States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today is a very important day for the health of European citizens. Indeed, this is, without doubt, one of the most important reforms of the entire parliamentary term when one considers the beneficial impact it will have on the health of European citizens. From today, the EU has stricter regulations and is establishing new upper limits on the sulphur content of marine fuels, which contain air pollutants that are estimated to cause as many as 50 000 premature deaths in Europe. For Northern European countries – the so-called Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) – a maximum sulphur content in fuels of below 0.1% comes into force from 2015 while, for all other countries, the limit will be 0.5% from 2020. We should no doubt have aimed higher; these new limits should have applied across the whole of the European Union. What price life, though? That is what thousands of European citizens are wondering in cities with major ports like that of my beautiful mistreated Venice, whose inhabitants and whose works of art are constantly being poisoned by smoke from the stacks of great ships. Well, thanks to Europe, that smoke will now be a little less black. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on the welfare of animals because it introduces important concepts for a better future for animals and European citizens. Issues including a new directive to protect dogs and cats, the violation of the directives on zoos and laying hens by many Member States, and maintaining the March 2013 deadline for cosmetics tested on animals must be addressed urgently and as a matter of priority. We also need to provide for mandatory labelling for meat from animals barbarically slaughtered without being stunned. We must adopt an EU law on animal welfare and set up a body that monitors whether the Member States enforce the rules on the industry. We can and we must, however, do much more for animal welfare. Modern, civilised Europe can no longer tolerate barbaric, uncivilised and backwards practices such as vivisection, hunting or bullfighting. Let us renounce these absurd activities right now, for a Europe that is more respectful of animals and more respectful of the views of its citizens, who are often much more far-sighted, caring and sensitive than national and EU authorities.

 In the resolution on the establishment of an EU legal framework for the protection of pets and stray animals, it is reiterated that the European Union is based on sharing different principles and values. Millions of European citizens attach a special sentimental value to animals and in particular to pets, such as dogs and cats. There are more than 100 million pets in Europe, but despite the large number, the EU still does not have an EU framework law to protect our pets and stray animals. With today’s vote, Parliament is giving a voice to thousands of European citizens and is urging the EU to establish a framework law to protect animals and in particular to lay down: rules for the identification and registration of animals; stray animal management strategies, including vaccination and sterilisation programmes; measures to promote responsible ownership; the prohibition of unlicensed kennels and shelters; the prohibition of killing of stray animals without medical indication; information and educational programmes in schools on animal welfare; and severe sanctions to be imposed on any Member State which fails to comply with the rules.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is life; water is a precious public asset that we have a duty and an interest in conserving and managing sustainably in order to safeguard ecosystems and the very survival of the human race. This important report takes stock of the implementation status of EU water legislation ahead of the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’, which the Commission has announced for this autumn. Much has been done in the 12 years since the Water Framework Directive entered into force, but there is still a huge amount left to do, especially in many southern European countries such as Italy, which is to appear before the Court of Justice because of delays in implementing the directive. We have to ensure sufficient availability of good-quality water, bearing in mind that water resources in Europe are distributed unevenly, and consequently we must mainstream this issue in all European policy areas. It is unacceptable that as much as 70% of the water supplied to our communities may be lost through leakage due to the poor state of repair of our water systems. We must reach the target of a green economy and equip ourselves with locally developed water plans that strictly combat waste and encourage water saving, reuse and recycling, whether for irrigation or for domestic use, and across all sectors of the economy.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the amendments to the regulation on the recovery of bluefin tuna stocks because, as acknowledged by the international scientific community, this is a species at risk of extinction. The figures speak for themselves: since 2009, there has been a sharp decrease in catches in all our seas. We therefore need to act swiftly in order to prevent the stock from disappearing completely. A telling example of the seriousness of the situation is the reduction in the average size of tuna fish, a phenomenon which is strikingly obvious in the Adriatic Sea, my region. We must urgently set up closed areas and sanctuaries for bluefin tuna where fishing is banned to allow stocks to recover. We need to step up controls, since illegal fishing in all European seas is still too widespread and too frequent. The envisaged measures, such as the seizure of illegal vessels and gear, must go hand in hand with effective, efficient controls, carried out by an appropriate number of employees. Lastly, it is essential to raise the minimum weight of tuna fish that may be caught, currently just 30 kilograms, and ban fishing during the spawning season. In order to save bluefin tuna we can, and must, do more. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Gerbrandy on an excellent report. The transition to a resource-efficient economy is inevitable and necessary. In 2050, the global population will reach 9 billion people and each of them will strive for a better life. As indicated by the Commission, at the current rate of resource use, in 2050, the equivalent of two Earths will be needed to sustain the world’s population. The case for ensuring each and every European policy is resource-efficient is therefore also economic. Member States must remove all obstacles to the market in waste recycling and reuse and provide economic incentives to promote innovative technologies for the collection and separation of waste. It is right to get to zero waste by banning landfill and phasing out the incineration of recyclables. We have to agree on indicators for resource use in economic activity, in other words, our footprint on the planet, our water footprint, our materials footprint and our carbon footprint. These indicators have to be used to promote legislative initiatives for sustainable development and less use of resources. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regional airports are important for improving Europe’s links and allowing its citizens to move around inside the Union, but these structures must be built and operated according to the European Union’s own environmental standards. We cannot allow air traffic, and with it regional airports, to further harm the European environment, our air quality and the well-being of our region. In northern Italy, for example – I am thinking of the cities of Treviso and Verona – the airport structures have been expanded in recent years without due consideration for the contexts in which these airports operate on a daily basis. More air connections in Europe are fine, but not at the cost of Europe’s environment, air and land. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against climate change is necessary for the survival of the planet. It is absolutely critical that Europe and all stakeholders strive to limit the increase in average temperatures to 2 °C. This is the only way that we can lower the risk of natural disasters, and consequent migration and population displacement. It is acknowledged at international level that it is certainly the poor who suffer the most. Well, 70% of the world’s poorest are women. In the developing world, it is women who play a crucial role in the abstraction and practical management of water, not just in the home but also in farming, and it is women who today have to work more owing to droughts and water shortages resulting precisely from climate change. This is why gender perspectives must be mainstreamed into all stages of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiation process, in order to effectively improve the welfare of women around the world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to what might soon be happening in one of Italy’s finest forests, the Cansiglio, located between the Veneto and Friuli regions. This is an area of great natural importance, part of the Natura 2000 network. It is here in this forest, once protected by the Most Serene Republic of Venice, that for the first time – after a ban that has lasted for centuries – hundreds of deer will be hunted, under proposals from the provinces of Treviso and Belluno and the Veneto and Friuli regional administrations. Pregnant does, on the point of delivery, will also be brutally killed, as set out in the culling plans. Under the pretext of overpopulation, disputed by the Worldwide Fund for Nature and many other associations, the Italian authorities are giving the green light to these killings. The EU must more effectively ensure compliance with directives protecting biodiversity, providing appropriate sanctions for any local administrations that violate them. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 215 million children worldwide used as child labour, 152 million child workers under the age of 15, 115 million children involved in dangerous activities – these are shocking figures that we can no longer tolerate. I voted in favour of the resolution on child labour in the cocoa sector, with absolute conviction, because the European Union has to play a fundamental role in stopping this form of modern slavery. The Commission must do its utmost to include effective provisions that will guarantee dignified employment and prevent forced child labour in all trade agreements with cocoa producing countries such as Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. We need a traceability mechanism to identify goods produced using child labour. The European Union has always defended the rights of the world’s most vulnerable people, and children working in the harvesting of cocoa beans deserve our full attention. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, one of the most important issues highlighted by the European Union Growth Survey 2012 is the serious need for new and stronger social and employment policies, especially for young people. A country with a high level of youth unemployment is a country destined to perish. In my country, Italy, the statistics are frightening. According to Eurostat data for November 2011, the youth unemployment rate is 30.1%. Young people who are often highly qualified with plenty of energy and motivation are allowed to wither away by a system where gerontocracy has become the norm. The Commission’s commitment in allocating EUR 82 billion from unused Structural Funds to stimulate growth and youth unemployment is a good step that needs to be made in the right direction. Investing in young people means investing in the future. Guaranteeing work for young Europeans means guaranteeing a future for us all. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Madam President, I should like to draw the attention of the Chamber and of European citizens to what has been going on for months in Ukraine. Since it was decided to hold the Euro 2012 football championship in Poland and Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities have, in order to stage a quick clean-up of their cities, unleashed a savage cull of stray dogs. These poor animals, including mothers and puppies, are being killed in their thousands by poisoning, clubbing and shooting, while even mobile crematory ovens are being used for this purpose. This terrible news has been broadcast around the world. On the Internet, one can see images of these acts of horrifying violence, which have been denounced and documented by reporters and local animal-protection societies. In view of the special relations that we have with this country, I call upon the European institutions to make urgent representations to the Ukrainian authorities to stop this uncivilised and barbaric massacre.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is clear from the numerous waste-related petitions received by Parliament from citizens: EU management of waste in Europe is not going well. There are too many citizens who even now, in 2012, are paying for the consequences of poor waste management in terms of their daily lives and their health, incinerators and landfills being cases in point. All the same, virtuous examples of ecologically sustainable waste management in the EU do exist. We must therefore do all we can to reach a point of total recycling, where waste actually becomes a genuine resource. This is already a reality today. There are treatment plants that recycle nearly 100% of urban waste, as in the case of the Vedelago waste centre in the province of Treviso, whose technology is exported throughout Europe. Nevertheless, we need more controls, prevention and, above all, responsible choices. We should recycle, recover and reduce waste and say ‘no’ to huge incinerators and landfills that are often the cause of air and aquifer pollution. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the resolution on the forthcoming international United Nations conference in Durban because I think that the climate change challenges posed by global warming require, more than ever, extremely strong commitment from Europe. Climate upheaval due to overheating is shown by irrefutable scientific proof and the consequent environmental, human and economic damage is now quite clear to everyone. This situation requires us to take fast, courageous decisions. Europe must retain a leading role in the fight against global overheating, committing to provide aid to other countries in terms of technology and resources. These financial resources must also be recovered through an international ‘Tobin tax’ on financial transactions. The Durban conference must lead to a legally binding international agreement with tangible outcomes for the fight against global warming. Above all, it must produce a clear calendar with deadlines and precise commitments for all countries of the world. All countries must finally put collective interests above their own individual interests because either we make an effort, or we will all pay a very hefty price. These are tough, extremely important and essential decisions, because there is no plan B any more. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, protecting bees means protecting all pollinating insects, agriculture, the environment and the ecosystem. I have abstained from voting on the resolution of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development because it is incomplete and not effective enough. The use of neonicotinoid pesticides to treat maize seeds in agriculture has led to the destruction of millions of bees. In Italy, we have experienced losses of between 30% and 70% of hives, causing serious damage to beekeepers, bees and the environment. In the two years that Italy has prohibited the use of these pesticides, two important results have come about: the bee population has recovered, and it has been demonstrated that maize production has not diminished without the use of pesticides. Today’s resolution has been a missed opportunity to call for the banishment across Europe of neonicotinoid pesticides. Europe should undertake to defend this most important natural asset on a wider scale and with greater conviction. Albert Einstein said, ‘If all the bees died, man would have four years to live’.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the continent of Europe is extremely rich in fresh water but risks becoming poor in drinking water. This is a paradox caused by the rising number of cases of water table pollution. In my region of Veneto, in Italy, for example, authorisation has been given over the last 50 years for quarrying below the water table and landfill sites that have resulted in serious pollution of the water table, groundwater and wells for drinking water. In May of this year, the Veneto Regional Environmental Protection Agency found mercury poisoning in over 100 wells located in various municipalities in the province of Treviso. Therefore, we need to take prompt action to immediately unlock the crucial Soil Directive, which was adopted at first reading by the European Parliament in 2007 but has remained blocked by the Council. The directive makes it mandatory to register and reclaim contaminated sites, which would solve the problem of water table pollution. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, the hunting season opens in many European countries in September, and people begin to shoot millions of wild animals in the name of an anachronistic activity which can no longer be justified. Despite the protection laid down by European laws, in certain countries, such as Italy, some local authorities allow exceptional hunting, namely the hunting of protected birds such as chaffinches or meadow pipits, just to pander to the hunters’ lobby and secure their votes. The Veneto and Lombardy regions have recently approved exceptional hunting again, demonstrating contempt and indifference, not least towards the European Court of Justice and its very recent judgments on this subject. Europe needs stricter rules. In order to protect wild animals we have to put an end to this barbarian medieval practice. We need to put an immediate stop to these illegal rules in these regions.

Madam President, there are two aspects to the measure that we have adopted, one geopolitical and the other environmental. Geopolitically the introduction of shale gas extraction could have a positive effect for Europe, since it might reduce our dependence on Iranian and Russian resources, but there are strong environmental concerns. This apparently harmless gas may have a severe impact on the environment, on nature and on the coming generations. The resolution we have adopted therefore takes a cautious approach and introduces a moratorium. However, we will have to return to the question to assess the environmental effects.

 Madam President, with this report Parliament is recognising how quickly the consumer credit market is changing. The financial crisis is also a credit crisis and the massive reduction in loans granted to families affects businesses and the whole economy. If the Commission could intervene to increase access to cross-border credit, which is currently too low, accounting for only 2 % of total credit in the EU, many Europeans who are currently unable to obtain loans in their own countries because of the economic problems of those countries could obtain them in other Member States, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of the single market for which the European institutions are fighting so hard to overcome national boundaries.

 Madam President, I am expressing my opinion and my vote in favour of the matter under discussion because the burgeoning of means of payment and the widespread use of ‘e-money’ demand rules that reflect the times and that reconcile the drive towards greater openness to the internal market with the need for transparency. There are some positive aspects to this, which have an impact on the fight against laundering money from unlawful activities and on tax evasion, which is an unfortunate feature of many Member States. However, we need to look at this in greater detail. I think it is essential that we understand the potential problems that multilateral interchange fees could cause as regards competitiveness, with costs and surcharges that discourage greater use of e-money, and some hidden interchange fees that could do the opposite of making for an open, competitive and transparent market system.

 – Madam President, I voted in favour of the Costa report against the wishes of my group, and I wanted to explain why this was. I believe the report covers most aspects of the fight against threats to children from the digital world. Protecting children is an urgent matter in a changing technological world, where family, schools and the education system are not always taking the necessary measures to prevent its harmful effects. There is plenty to do, but it was the positive aspects of this report that made me vote for it. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of the text adopted today, which stems from the Commission Communication of 2011 on Social Business Initiative. The Europe 2020 strategy lies ahead, and with it we will need to provide answers to the ever-increasing need for social services, for example in the health and nursing sectors, and to estimate the demographic trend we have to deal with. However, this must be accompanied by a high degree of innovation and experimentation, the success or failure of which is a matter for the European institutions to evaluate within a set timescale, so we can see whether this initial approach could bring about improvements and can continue to develop this type of enterprise effectively in the longer term. We need to bear in mind that the nature of this type of business is very specific, having to reconcile economic growth with solidarity. For this reason I voted in favour, so that this constructive approach can be a basic pillar of a new society that reclaims the meaning and value of a job where humans are central to society in a new, integrated kind of humanism.

 As rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I actively assisted in drafting the macro-regional strategy for the Mediterranean. I see it as a territorial cooperation tool that will achieve greater synergy between the various intervention instruments through multi-level governance. In this respect, the strategy for the Mediterranean may hinge on the need to develop an integrated maritime transport system covering the whole Mediterranean basin and the development of renewable energy. A fundamental issue that I have worked for in this dossier is to address the island question at a European level and to ask the EU institutions to implement Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union by adopting an ad hoc
 strategy that takes account of the handicaps faced by islands. Another feature of the dossier is the provision that the Commission, in collaboration with the forthcoming Cypriot Presidency of the EU, will adopt a strategic plan for islands that creates the conditions for economic growth in these territories while ensuring their full territorial continuity. A particularly significant point is the call for the Commission to adopt measures, such as increasing the threshold for de minimis
 aid for islands in the transport, agriculture and fishery sectors, which will make the islands equally competitive with the mainland territories. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Mr President, I, together with the Italian Italia dei Valori
 delegation, have backed the introduction of the Tobin tax, a financial speculation tax, since 2010. Today, Parliament voted in favour of introducing this tax, which we believe to be an essential tool to ensure that the financial sector assumes its responsibilities and is steered back towards the real economy. As far as we are concerned, the introduction of a European financial transaction tax (FTT) reasserts the supremacy of democratic politics over the serious discrepancies in the functioning of the financial markets, which caused the economic crisis we are experiencing today. The FTT does away with the exemption from tax on financial transactions and makes financial speculators responsible in the same way as ordinary citizens, who have to pay taxes even on bread and petrol on a daily basis. With expected revenues of over EUR 50 billion a year, the European Parliament is today sending a signal that it is taking responsibility, in order to create more solidarity in the world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I voted in favour of the own-initiative report on regional airports, and I am sure it will serve as a basis for their further regulation. This report shows the importance that the European Parliament attributes to these airports in the context of air transport and the important role that they play as a vehicle for territorial, economic and social cohesion within the European Union. For the first time, the definition of a regional airport has been provided and an attempt has been made to limit the area of reference by sub-dividing regional airports into major and minor airports, also in relation to passenger throughput and the links provided by such airports. It is certainly to be hoped that the Commission will then follow up with more stringent specifications for their definition. A special passage concerns recognition of the need to guarantee public service obligations for remote regions, islands and the outermost regions, as we are well aware of their handicap in terms of participation in the single market. Finally, I believe that the definition establishing and specifying the negative view of the irrational proliferation of further regional airports is useful. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal to amend the provisions on risk-sharing instruments is extremely timely for those Member States at risk of suffering great difficulties as a result of the current financial instability. Its arrival during this period of serious economic crisis is perfect. Hence, in this amendment to the regulation on risk-sharing instruments, countries such as Ireland, Portugal, Hungary, Romania, Lithuania and above all Greece will find an alternative to the threat of losing funds already assigned and therefore the chance to carry on with programmes cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund that are proving difficult to implement in these Member States. This will result in the projects being carried out and jobs being retained across the parts of the European Union most affected by the economic crisis, without eating into the EU’s budget in any way but instead making a major contribution to growth in Europe.

 I voted in favour of Mr Taylor’s own-initiative report because it calls on the Commission to intervene both to enforce existing legislation and to promote and simplify the use of the instruments that protect air passenger rights. This report emphasises the legal certainty of passengers’ rights, their right to information, and the independence and operational transparency of the independent enforcement bodies that can impose penalties for infringements and resolve disputes between passengers and the industry. All too often, passengers find that they are the victims of the abusive practices of air carriers, which take advantage of passengers’ lack of information about their own rights in order to delay or cancel flights arbitrarily without accepting the liability that they should accept by law. I hope, therefore, that this report can provide useful suggestions for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, which is expected to take place next year.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a picture of Rossella Urru, the young Sardinian woman kidnapped in Algeria on 23 October along with two Spanish colleagues during a cooperation mission to help the poorest inhabitants of the Maghreb. Rossella is a young woman who has dedicated her life to a noble occupation, namely helping people in need. The young woman’s family, the Italian nation, and all of us eagerly await her release and the release of all European citizens who are hostages or have been abducted. Rossella is a young European citizen, a standard-bearer of our values, and that is why she must return home. That is why I am calling for the foreign service and our High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, to redouble their diplomatic efforts to ensure that Rossella can regain her freedom and return home.

 Mr President, the milk and milk products sector has been undergoing a terrible crisis for some years now, but there are internal imbalances that this report and its amendment – which I supported from the start – will determine to a lesser extent, by influencing how it works and putting an end to these internal imbalances, or at least remedying them in part together with other instruments. This measure has been produced by the working group set up by Mr Cioloş, which produced some instruments for restoring balance to the added value for all operators in the supply chain. In specific terms, the terms and conditions of contracts will have determined characteristics of form, requirements and duration, which will mainly be useful to producers. One important element will concern raw milk processed in less favoured areas (LFAs), mountainous areas, intermediate areas and islands, where any transfer of milk from areas which are not LFAs must be authorised in advance.

 Madam President, I voted for the report by Mr Fleckenstein because I am fully convinced that an Agency as important as the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) must have a regulation that specifies clear, precise duties, and highlights the effective division of tasks between EMSA, the European Commission and the Member States. All too often we are witness to accidents that pollute our seas, which are under constant threat also from the rise in the transport of dangerous goods and materials by sea, often in maritime areas protected by special rules due to their naturalistic importance, such as the Bocche di Bonifacio. In this regard, I particularly appreciated the rapporteur’s focus on development of the CleanSeaNet service and the SaveSeaNet network. The text was very balanced despite being multi-faceted, recognising the need to define EMSA’s tasks also by taking on more staff, without putting too much pressure on the budget, and underlining the importance of innovative tools such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme (GMES), while also launching a positive message on support in the sector for gender equality policies.

 Madam President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Grosch on a Single European Transport Area, and would like to thank him for his work. I would particularly like to thank him for the welcome references to the new guidelines on the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), which will animate the future legal debate, and for recognising the value of innovative instruments such as Galileo, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and Global Monitoring for Environment and Safety (GMES.) However, I am sorry that some aspects of fundamental importance in creation of a real Single European Transport Area were not adequately explored. More specifically, the insular nature of many European countries has not been investigated in sufficient detail, particularly with regard to the regulations that apply to them in terms of their obligations to provide public transport, which are currently muddled and difficult to describe as far as the various modes of transport are concerned. Lastly, I found the text did not sufficiently cover the issue of transporting hazardous goods, which needs to be properly dealt with and regulated, both in order to avoid terrible accidents, and in order to manage accidents once they have happened, including in terms of the liability of the entities involved, institutions or otherwise.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was among those who signed the alternative resolution on the health of honeybees, because the report put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) completely rejected the recommendations indicated in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) opinion, for which I was a shadow rapporteur. The plague inflicted upon bees is a problem which is becoming more and more serious, and there is plenty of scientific confirmation to show the damage caused by pesticides and monocultures. In order to understand this, we only have to think of areas of the world, for instance certain valleys in China, where pollination is now carried out by hand precisely as a result of uninhibited overuse of particular types of pesticides over time. Yet, the report approved today by the European Parliament has not taken a stance on this topic. We lack a critical objective on the toxicity of pesticides, specifically, the prohibition of systematic neurotoxins; we lack indications for the beekeeping sector relating to contamination of honey produce by GMO crops; we lack a critique on monoculture; and we lack the idea that large-scale changes are required in agriculture, including crop rotation, to reduce the use of pesticides, with a view to reversing the sharp decline in the production of pollinators.

 Mr President, in order to evaluate the report adopted today, we need to start by extrapolating two fundamental facts: the fact that the number of dependent people with disabilities will supposedly double by 2050, and the fact that, at the moment, we do not have a sufficient amount of data to gauge the severity of the problem. The challenge being addressed by means of this Disability Strategy 2010-2020 is to allow people with disabilities not only to enjoy human rights, just like everyone else, but also to ensure that those rights can be put into practice effectively. It is therefore essential to bring out disabled people’s full potential by encouraging them to train, providing them with freedom of movement and enabling them to access the labour market: by so doing, we will also be able to combat one of the biggest problems that adds to the misfortune of these people, namely, poverty.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the Green Paper on the modernisation of public procurement policy for two reasons in particular. Firstly, identification of the most economically advantageous tender which takes into account the entire life-cycle costs of the relevant goods, works or services and therefore not just the lowest price – a common, widespread consideration in all countries and all contracting authorities – which will improve quality, and, at the same time, place greater emphasis on the environmental and social sustainability of goods and services. Secondly, simplification, which will be achieved through greater flexibility, and which will allow for simpler procedures and offer small and medium-sized enterprises greater opportunities in the awarding of contracts. I would add, in particular, that in this regard, we should promote electronic procurement, which currently accounts for less than five per cent of all public procurement in the EU, and that the publication of calls for tender, divided into lots, will enable greater transparency when it comes to participation in tenders.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the whole package of six measures, this one therefore included, because they represent a fundamental transition towards true European governance. We are doing this in order to take responsibility and bring budgets under control, even where national governments, the governments of Member States, have failed to do so. This is, moreover, the moment at which the credibility of our institutions, of European institutions, is at stake. Europe is taking upon itself the duty of making its citizens’ demands its own and of securing that stability, that government in order to create the conditions for growth, without which there would not have been and could not now be a future for our citizens and especially for new generations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Ms Goulard on having tackled and completed such a difficult text: it too is a fundamental step in the direction of European governance. It is also a practical move on the part of Parliament to take forward the statements we have heard again today in plenary, but which are often not acted on. This is the specific call, I repeat, that we are also making to President Barroso, because everyone agrees when a statement of principle is made. There was agreement when the Commission’s programme was adopted in this House, but it needs to be implemented. This report is a specific step towards the implementation of that programme.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Haglund again here on the work he has done. I voted in favour of it, and in fact I welcome the entire package. The report introduces penalties for macroeconomic imbalances, but it should be said that those penalties are to be imposed only if Member States demonstrate an unwillingness to adopt the necessary corrective policies, because, if the finance situation does not improve, Mr De Angelis, there can be no prospect of growth, or no prospect of satisfactory and meaningful growth, anyway. For that reason I believe that the package that has been adopted today will serve as a basis for the growth that the Member States as a whole must in fact aim for. If we stop here, we will definitely not have achieved the objectives that we are setting ourselves, but in taking this step we will certainly be able to achieve that other objective. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation that we have adopted on the prevention of macroeconomic imbalances among the 27 countries is certainly a departure from the previous situation. It establishes rules and checks and, in particular, it introduces the concept of symmetry, which means that the Commission must assess not only deficits, but also surpluses. In practice, contrary to the commonly held view that there a few bad countries, such as Greece or Italy, countries such as Germany and the Netherlands are also being placed under supervision due to their overly low levels of domestic consumption. Furthermore, the regulation has an essentially federalist outlook and hence stresses the notion of fairness, which we believe is one of the positive elements that characterise the future of Europe and of the Member States – fairness and solidarity, which will be the preconditions for European growth. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out, now that we have reached the conclusion a year after the proposal was first tabled, that the Feio report reviews the Stability and Growth Pact and hence finally establishes a check requiring States with a debt/GDP ratio of more than 60% to achieve a 5% reduction. It does so by laying down and clarifying the debt criterion and the procedures on the pace that has to be followed. The Commission will have to consider a range of factors in this global economic context before assessing and making its recommendations to the Member State concerned. The report introduces the fundamental principle that reducing one’s debt means paying less interest and therefore being able to spend more on investment and growth, which is the real objective on which we will have to focus over the next few months.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, more than a year ago now, when the initial problems in the Greek economy, and then in the economies of other countries, began to emerge, I was interviewed by the European channel. One of the points I raised was precisely the attention paid to the statistical data that allowed some countries to fiddle their accounts. The Ford report, which we have voted on and approved today, by contrast lays down criteria on the transparency and independence of national statistical authorities, with penalties for those who commit forgery and fraud. It is a fundamental report, in that it aims to prevent a lack of transparency in the compilation of statistical data and ensures that those data are uniform. This will enable the European institutions and the governments of all the countries to proceed uniformly, in other words to have criteria that are not only based on knowledge but which are also uniform in terms of the actions carried out.

 Madam President, Commissioner Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased, and first of all, therefore, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Gardini, and the shadow rapporteurs for their fruitful collaboration on such a highly topical and extremely important dossier as this. As I was saying, we are pleased with the balanced, rational approach adopted in the report, which perfectly takes account of the principle of subsidiarity and the idea of a solidarity clause, which should guide the Member States’ actions in their response to disasters and in their civil protection role. Specifically, I believe it is necessary to develop a predictable, pre-planned system within the European Union’s Civil Protection Mechanism that is in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity. In other words, it must not involve setting up a supranational body, which would be liable to duplicate costs and powers without any assurance that it would work efficiently. I particularly welcome the attention devoted to extremely vulnerable areas such as islands, which is clearly expressed throughout the body of the report, as well as the emphasis on the link between disaster preparation, prevention and response, which make up an inseparable trio. Lastly, I am pleased to see how sensitively other Members have addressed the subject of major regional threats, which I believe deserves our attention; in particular, there have been many references to actions and strategies targeting forest fires.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted overall in favour of Mr Koch’s report because I agree with its targeted approach inasmuch as it asks the Commission for a concrete, circumstantiated commitment to road safety, including the development of the proposed models into a fully-fledged new action plan. The plan must incorporate a set of detailed measures, with clear timetables and monitoring instruments to assess the progress made, as well as a mid-term review. Conversely, I did not wish to support the idea of appointing an EU road safety coordinator, which, in my view, would be likely to duplicate powers and generate an excessively bureaucratic mechanism. Of course, it seems obvious that achieving the target of halving road accident victims by 2020 would also require a financial commitment that currently appears to be difficult to achieve. In conclusion, however, I regret the fact that the Committee on Transport and Tourism was not bold or ambitious enough to accept a complete harmonisation of important road safety rules, such as standardising the EU direction of travel in the United Kingdom and Malta as well, as I proposed in an amendment which the committee chose not to accept.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe I wish to express my satisfaction with the work that has been carried out. It is an historic step in the institutional evolution of Europe following the Treaty of Lisbon that for the first time competences are assigned to Parliament and the Commission in relation to tourism, which is the third component of the economy and of employment in Europe. First of all, I would like to stress that the text that is being put to the House today sets out a comprehensive governance that stems from Europe 2020 strategy and develops a series of proposals to achieve growth that is smart, sustainable and inclusive in every sense. Accordingly, it suggests specific programming instruments such as strategies for macro-regions, interregionality and joint and complementary planning. At times like these, when governance loses its bearings, we know what the negative effects are. Here, on the other hand, the dossier traces a very precise path. Out of these plans and instruments, I wish to call to mind the extraordinary plan to foster a progressive reduction in the seasonal nature of tourism, set out in paragraph 63 of the report. From the point of view of a European economy that, unfortunately, is losing a large share of industrial output, tourism can and must represent an important factor for overall growth, above all if the main public and private players can create an integrated approach between the different policies of the sector, the various financial instruments and build tourism into a real system that brings together the various economic sectors: agriculture, industry, craft, transport, services, and so on. I should mention that the text being voted upon contains numerous references to islands and remote areas which represent, as I was saying at the outset, a tangible way of achieving, through appropriate financial instruments, the criterion of inclusion sought by Europe 2020 strategy. Ladies and gentlemen, the tourism sector is also characterised by sustainable growth in environmental and social terms, which supports SMEs for which we have provided a business incubator tool, for innovation by way of supplying knowledge tools that will enable them to achieve, and the tourist to obtain, better travel solutions. Further, beyond the specific actions already put forward by the Commission I must give credit to Commissioner Tajani for the particular attention paid to SMEs and micro-enterprises, which must be singled out. In the report, they are regarded as guaranteeing innovation from the bottom up and they are expressly recognised as fulfilling the function of ensuring the quality, variety and authenticity of the different regions.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the compromise reached between Parliament and the European Council, European consumers will now be able to know where the meat on their table comes from. My amendment, which is taken up in the institutional compromise, was undoubtedly more ambitious and required more extensive marking of the origin and provenance of other products too – not just of meat, but of milk, dairy products in general and meat used as an ingredient in food. Nevertheless, it is satisfying to know that a road map has been established that will see the Commission present a specific report on this issue in two and three years’ time. The report will therefore include proposals to ensure the increased – not to say full – protection of all Europeans in the near future. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on which we voted today regarding European Union legislation on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, known as ‘mad cow disease’, testifies to the excellence of the European policies that have been adopted to protect human and animal health. The number of cases has certainly diminished in recent years, and this enables us to apply less alarming countermeasures, hence, for example, where a case appears in a herd, it is now possible to avoid culling the entire herd, but to use the milk produced until it is fully depleted. We all remember with great concern the images of entire herds slaughtered if one animal had contracted the disease, and that is something that we shall now avoid. We must, however, continue to be vigilant, Madam President, because the text we have adopted today introduces a considerable risk to health and opens the way to free use of animal meal. In this regard, we must remain vigilant. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Lepage for her determined work in bringing this dossier to a positive conclusion. I have been a staunch supporter of this report throughout, partly because I think it gives real legal value to the text we have adopted and also because it fills a legislative vacuum that has given rise to serious legal dispute between enterprises, public bodies and citizens. This measure avoids the colonisation of the Member States, leaving them free to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of genetically modified organisms. The amendments that this text brings in will therefore allow the individual Member States to ban the cultivation of GMOs due to the impact they may have on the agricultural system, particularly with regard to biodiversity, but also with regard to pesticide resistance, to the invasiveness of certain crops and, therefore, to the protection of our territories.

Mr President, the report by Mr Pieper on the post-2013 cohesion policy reduces the effects of a two-speed Europe. Indeed, only uniform growth can ensure proper cohesion between our territories and overall unity, even in diversity. I voted in favour of the text because it introduces an intermediate category, which allows may European regions to continue to benefit from the same amount of structural funds as they have done so far. The lack of efficient programming for the use of European funds has unfortunately resulted in many regions being unable to make proper use of the resources made available by the European Union, thereby risking a majority of the funds being left unused. Here, however, Brussels is sending out a positive message. We hope that our regions will know how to interpret and use the funds in the best possible way. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

I voted in favour of the identification of new parameters more representative of a country’s progress, and not just its consumption, although I think more should be done. The report in question has had a long and difficult journey, and finally made it to the plenary session having lost much of its content along the way. Parliament should have put forward a proposal taking into account factors including education, health and personal activities, but it confined itself to highlighting the need to establish new parameters, delegating the task of defining them to the Commission. Gross domestic product is an outdated indicator based on economic principles that, by reducing quality to quantity, overlook the meaning of things and individual and collective well-being, undervalue work in itself compared to the object of production, and consider only the production of new objects, not maintenance.

Mr President, as shadow rapporteur of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am completely satisfied with the outcome of today’s vote. The report by Mr Arsenis on the protection of forests is a policy report; it is a basis for confirming how the European Parliament intends to tackle the protection of our forest heritage and the adaptation of forests to climate change. Today, the European Parliament clearly expressed its point of view, in the light of which we expect the Commission to make the necessary proposals and so enable even more detailed policies to be drafted for the sector. I would particularly like to thank Mr Arsenis for his expert and professional work, which involved a long and difficult debate, because – as we are well aware – the forest situation is not the same in all the Member States. Despite this, we found common ground and also achieved some specific objectives, for example, the protection of certain parts from land speculation, greater protection of forests which are prized for their biodiversity, such as the northern Boreal and Mediterranean forests, and a ban on building on land cleared by arson. Mr President, as I have said, this is very important for many Mediterranean countries, including your own country, Greece. Giommaria Uggias,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has endorsed my recommendation for discharge to be granted to the European transport agencies, which support the European Commission. The discharge is granted because the Court of Auditors deemed that the annual accounts of the agencies were substantially reliable, although we must take note of and underscore a number of critical issues. Some of these issues are common to all the agencies or some of them, including for example: cancellations and delays in procurement procedures, failure to observe Staff Regulations, or the violation of the principle of budgetary annuality. These agencies’ commitment to overcome said problems should, however, be highlighted. In general terms, I should like to make two brief political observations, namely the lack of any multiannual programming – which is symptomatic of a leadership deficit – and the dearth of incisiveness in the work of some agencies, such as the European Railway Agency. In the same vein, I should like to note the delay – some two years after the fact – in setting up procedures to determine responsibility for the Viareggio disaster. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are taking a step forward in understanding that this is not a problem linked to some areas of Europe, Southern Europe or North Africa. However, my view of the measure is a positive one. I would like to ask Mr Tarabella whether he or the Commission does not think that the problem of application to veterinary services should also be tackled immediately, so that there could be a measure which would make it possible to eliminate the problem throughout the European Union. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important measure for the agricultural world. However, the measure needs to be followed up immediately by a commitment from the Council and national governments to adopt it forthwith, before the end of the season, in order to solve this problem which does not affect just the southern part of Europe, but the whole of Europe, as today’s vote has shown. Bluetongue affects the sheep and cattle on our farms. Therefore, taking action to totally eradicate it is a health policy objective which national governments can best contribute to through this measure by being flexible. It also needs to be immediately adopted through transposition of the directive. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian delegation from Italia dei Valori 
voted against the text of the resolution on nuclear power, because it was not clear enough to indicate a clear no to nuclear power. Unfortunately, all the amendments that could have improved the text and chosen a Europe free of nuclear power, immediately free of existing nuclear power stations and with no future nuclear power stations, were rejected. A Europe free of nuclear power is the only possible route if we want to guarantee that our children and future generations will have a future protected from the repetition of catastrophes like Fukushima and Chernobyl. These lessons tell us that there is no such thing as theoretical safety. That is why we have to say a clear no to the nuclear option and invest in research and innovation in other sources that are truly green, renewable and clean. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I worked as shadow rapporteur on this dossier and so could not but vote in favour, together with my group. I did so believing it to be a very useful tool for the development of a sector that will be a driving force for the European economy. Industry is moving away from Europe; agriculture suffers from serious deficiencies; meanwhile, tourism is one area that can certainly offer prospects for employment, economic development and intelligent, inclusive and compatible growth. To this end, the instrument we have approved today, which allows for more modern data gathering, processing, treatment and transmission than the previous situation, will surely give impetus to this activity. This is why the ALDE Group and I have voted in favour. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measure we have voted on today is of some help in clarifying the phenomenon of migration flows and praises the work of Frontex. I think this should be seen positively and therefore so should the result of the vote. I do, however, believe that this stance should be accompanied by equal clarity on the part of the Member States, because this challenge affects not only the European Institutions but also policy in the Member States. I must say, however, that so far not all Member States have implemented and practiced such clarity, starting with the policy of the Italian Government, which has dealt with the situation in Lampedusa in a most objectionable and questionable manner. Thousands of migrants there have been essentially abandoned to their fate, whilst human solidarity – never mind legal solidarity – would have led to immediate care and certainly greater respect than has been shown, notwithstanding the fact that the legal problem would then have to be dealt with, as we have done in this House.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a staunch supporter of the anti-nuclear cause I backed this report not only because I think the decommissioning of these plants is of benefit to all, but also because I hope that no more will be able to be built. Today we are faced with a ticking time-bomb across Europe. The operation of nuclear power plants for civilian purposes is founded on engineering practices which are now outdated and anachronistic. It can be said that their safety is ever more theoretical: everything will be fine, as long as nothing happens. In fact, we are dealing with protocols from 50 years ago which, in reality, are not protected against events that may be increasingly unforeseeable. Terrorist attacks could not have been foreseen and nor could the natural and disastrous events – not only earthquakes – which unfortunately are increasingly frequent in our disaster-stricken world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the committee Chair, Brian Simpson, for leading the work of the committee and work on the file, and, above all, for having allowed its conclusion – at least I hope so because the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) will be voting for this – and approval on first reading, and hence the successful conclusion of the regulation. This task actually involves reviewing the regulation, which sets out to establish a common framework for the collection of statistics on tourism and, more specifically, for all its stages, ranging from the collection to the processing, treatment and transmission of statistics, enabling optimum knowledge of the financial world that is activated and revolves around tourism. Mr President, it is clear that, since the 1995 directive, which is the predecessor of this directive, remarkable growth has been recorded in tourism and we must acknowledge, in particular, the great prospects that the economic system of tourism will contribute to the European economy as a whole in the near future. I worked on the file as a shadow rapporteur for the ALDE Group and, as I said earlier, we are going to vote in favour of it. I think the Simpson report will be particularly popular due to the notion of tourism satellite accounts, namely, the adoption of pilot projects that will make it possible to assess the economic impact on individual sectors of the economy, in other words, aspects relating to same-day visits, the evaluation report to be drawn up every five years and the possibility, indeed the necessity, of a five-yearly report to assess the effects of statistics. I will conclude by saying that this is part of the new responsibility arising out of the Treaty of Lisbon and I think this time, we are beginning to assume the responsibilities of Parliament effectively and we will do the same with the next file being worked on, soon to arrive in this Chamber.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we were delighted to adopt the measures proposed by Mrs Podimata. For those of us in the Italian delegation of the Italia dei Valori
 party within the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, this was a moment of great satisfaction, because it shows that Parliament knows how to follow up its statements of principle. In fact, as early as the debate on the report by Mrs Berès on the financial, economic and social crisis, we had argued in favour of a tax on financial transactions. This was done today, so we are delighted to declare that we voted in favour because this tax will shift financial resources from the financial economy – and therefore away from financial speculation – to the real economy. The tax will also respond to the Millennium Development Goals and contribute to large European projects in infrastructure, research, ecological restructuring and in our system of production.

 Mr President, the resolution adopted today has established important principles for the protection of consumers, increasing safeguards against the spread of falsified medicinal products. This is an extremely dangerous phenomenon, and one of the most significant remedies has been to stem the online sale of medicines of dubious origin. Moreover, through the adoption of a number of guarantees, we will establish strict regulations that require permits and inspections. This does not, however, mean that forms of health protection and medical prescriptions are cancelled out. It must be remembered that the legislative power of Member States is unaffected in this respect and that they may retain or limit the ban on the online sales of drugs within their territory. This is an opportunity for Member States to better regulate the matter, but we must remember, Mr President, that citizens can order medicines from another Member State and that this regulation should not be seen as another opportunity to benefit the pharmaceutical industry. Instead we must continue to progress along the trail of liberalisation that the EU is currently blazing by adopting measures such as this. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Cancian on his excellent work in bringing this measure to its conclusion. Mr Mastella will allow me to disagree with him on the idea that this measure represents a great victory for our citizens. One cannot but note that citizens are only protected if they travel further than 250 km by coach or bus. Where is the protection for the rights of citizens of Europe if – as Mrs Meissner has already stressed – entire States such as Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are excluded from this protection? These are the reasons why our group abstained in the vote. We did not vote against the report because some rights are protected, such as those of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. That is why we abstained. As for the rest of it, we would ask to return to the issue as soon as possible in order to really protect our citizens. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Madam President, when, a century ago, Antonio Meucci’s patent was not recognised by the American telephony industry, it was not because of a lack of English or his use of Italian, but instead the failure to meet a condition: he did not have the money to register his patent for another year. In a similar vein, we are now in a paradoxical situation and, quite apart from the vote, I think that the fact that a trilingual patent system is to be adopted, which excludes Italian, is basically a sign of the weakness of our government, its inability to make its voice heard in European politics, and the weakness of our political system, which reflects, above all, on research and innovation. On this issue, we need only recall the competitiveness study published last December, which shows that in recent years, Italy has willingly handed over EUR 4 billion to other countries that have welcomed our researchers. These researchers certainly no longer have any need for Italian, since they have learnt English, French and German and have all the tools required to submit these patents, to the detriment of Italian products. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Madam President, I mostly support the amendments proposed through this text, which in any case essentially does nothing more than codify previous legislation regarding the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and animal feedingstuffs. We are forgetting and letting it pass somewhat unnoticed that we are talking about waste from nuclear accidents. This means that we have to continue to pay close attention to the risks of nuclear plants and to the fact that these are the consequences of the rotten and poisonous results of what, in certain States, we insist on developing. It is therefore a measure that must inspire us all to be as vigilant as possible. Getting to the heart of the matter, I do, however, think that more could be done to bring in compulsory immediate notification, which would allow all risk factors to be dealt with together. Furthermore, there should be no way to avoid the requirement to notify government authorities in the event of an accident. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we have adopted the resolution on waste in Campania, which should be a lesson to us all to prevent environmental disasters like this from happening. We can feel pleased with ourselves today, because in this plenary we have adopted a measure like this, which makes a culture of recycling and reuse at a time of globalisation a measure to be promoted and encouraged in every possible way to ensure that European citizens, who are now free from the effort of producing the goods that are now within everyone’s reach, are aware of their real value. Mr Florenz’s report on the reuse of electrical and electronic equipment, on which we are voting today, is important not only for the future of environmental sustainability in Europe, but also for another aspect: the loss of raw materials. In fact, the efficient and innovative use of materials and resources is a key issue in the globalised economy. I therefore consider it positive that we have set ourselves ambitious targets and also that the actual cost of a product should be indicated in such a way that consumers become aware of it. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent weeks, the various parliamentary committees that are dealing with the issue of the common agricultural policy have been looking into the matter of the post-2013 reform. Clearly, food security is one of the fundamental elements of agriculture. This consideration must therefore be viewed in the light of the report being put to the vote today, in which food security is defined as a fundamental right that must accordingly be safeguarded in every possible way. Such attention is required, Mr President, whenever there is an emergency, such as that linked to the dioxin scandal that we are witnessing at the moment, with the discovery that dioxin is being used in animal feed, but also, and above all, to ensure that we have a common production process that respects the production sector as a whole, that respects the quality of farmers’ work, the environment and marketing, and hence, that respects consumers. This report forms part of a set of measures that this House has developed to promote agriculture, and I can therefore say that I am satisfied. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is one of the pillars of the European Union. There is no doubt that, under the same general conditions, enterprises can produce and sell their products and services without public support, but not all sectors and not all areas are operating under conditions of parity. It is therefore fair, as in this instance, to correct situations of economic disadvantage and allow productive businesses to remain on the market and maintain employment levels, as in Sulcis for example, where 500 families would have found themselves without work, without income and without dignity. We must realise that when we speak of coal, we are talking about areas that have no alternative to mines and should be allowed the opportunity to adopt production technologies that are competitive and compatible with the free market and with the environment. Logically, postponing the deadline to 2018 must represent an imperative to ensure that institutions and companies take immediate action to develop technological, financial and environmental compatibility conditions that are in line with the challenges that await us.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, 14 February, is European Epilepsy Day. This is a condition from which 6 million European citizens suffer, of whom some 300 000 are Italians. It is therefore important that associations, including the Italian Epilepsy Association, dedicated to increase awareness of such a serious condition about which there is still much ignorance, a lack of clear information and regarding which many extremely delicate aspects remain unknown, should organise meeting opportunities over this period. Some steps forward have been made in the last few years at European level, especially through a 2009 directive, but there is still much to do, especially to guarantee full civil rights to sufferers from this condition in the world of work and of mobility, and in guaranteeing the availability of medication during school hours. I therefore consider days of reflection on such fundamental aspects of these problems to be very important. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the waste crisis in Campania, which was adopted by a majority today, is a very important sign. The emergency in Campania has become a European emergency, and that is a decision in favour of the people of Campania. We are saying ‘no’ to the disbursement of funds that are used simply to strengthen corrupt politicians, unscrupulous businessmen and organised crime; ‘yes’ to European money if a credible, environmentally friendly waste plan is put forward; ‘no’ to uncontrolled landfill in national parks; ‘no’ to dioxin-producing incinerators; and ‘yes’ to recycling and environmentally friendly methods. We are also saying ‘no’ to the criminalisation of dissent in local communities, and therefore ‘yes’ to legality. It is an important turning point and a warning to the Berlusconi Government and the regional government run by Stefano Caldoro, which so far have done nothing but talk and bolster up their cliques and the Mafia establishment. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
). 
 – (IT)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the lies told by the Berlusconi government, which assumed office in 2008 telling Italians that the waste problem had been resolved, the European Union is doing the right thing by refusing to grant Italy funding until an environmentally friendly waste system based on recycling of waste and composting has been presented. That system is certainly not provided for by Mr Caldoro’s plan, which is based once again on uncontrolled landfills such as the ones at Chiaiano, Taverna del Re and Terzigno – the Terzigno landfill is actually inside Vesuvius National Park – nor by incinerators, which cause death, cancers and full-blown health crises. In the 13 years that the environmental crisis has been going on, public funds in Campania have strengthened the criminal links between politicians, both on the left and on the right, businessmen and the Camorra. Furthermore, environmental issues are not resolved by criminalising dissent or by criminalising local communities, families and the region, as the Italian Government has done by using batons to restrain anyone who defends the environment and the land. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that if we can now talk about a reduction in errors, we owe this to the skill, independence and professionalism of the Court of Auditors, and I should like President Caldeira to take note of this. I believe that, as well as the Commission, Parliament played an important part in this improvement, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control, which sets great store by the subject of transparency and the effective and efficient use of public funds. We must still see what we can do to improve, however, because there are still too many things that are not right, particularly in very sensitive sectors such as agriculture and cohesion, with often worrying error rates in sectors where fraud in areas such as contracts and over-invoicing is rife. I believe that it is necessary to lower the rate of bureaucracy and reduce pointless red tape and instead introduce a few clear rules to send out a very clear and determined ‘no’ to every form of fraud in sectors where corruption is endemic. Another important factor is to step up the role of OLAF, the anti-fraud office, to combat all forms of fraud and corruption. Another aspect that we cannot fail to emphasise – we learned this also from a recent visit by the Committee on Budgetary control to Italy – is that there is also a risk of the forceful influence of organised crime and forms of corruption on public funds. The role of OLAF could therefore be essential from this viewpoint, together with greater cooperation between Member States, the Commission and Parliament. Another absolutely essential point is that I believe the Commission must strengthen its independence from Member States. I believe that we must block funds to prevent repetition of this type of behaviour, particularly in states where serious errors – I am not talking about minor errors – and very substantial episodes of fraud have been going on for years. The credibility level of the European Parliament and the European institutions is determined greatly by the level of transparency and correctness with which public funds are spent. I therefore believe that we have room for improvement on this score. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find President Sarkozy’s decision to be very serious: once again, in an effort to conceal internal political problems – as has already happened in Italy – he is attempting to regain support by criminalising outsiders and migrants, playing on people’s anxieties over social safety. Before Europe becomes the Europe of markets, it must be the Europe of rights, the Europe of solidarity and the Europe of inclusion. This is why President Sarkozy’s statement was immediately followed by the very serious statement by the Italian Minister for the Interior, who wishes to adopt the Sarkozy method and extend it to EU citizens, expelling them without incomes or homes. Therefore, rather than promoting inclusion policies, policies that reduce social inequalities and seek to unite people, the aim is once again to criminalise people. This is very serious because migrants, outsiders, those who are considered to be on the fringes of society are useful when they are needed, for example, for illegal work; in other words, when they have duties to perform but no rights. If an outsider, a Roma or a migrant commits a crime, he is punished, but this must not be a pretext for justifying very serious expulsions. The Commission must react if it wants a Europe of solidarity, equality and freedom. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
). 
 – (IT) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when building a Europe of rights, an essential part is played by freedom of information, pluralism of information and independence of information. Is the Commissioner aware that there is one country in the European Union – which is incidentally a founder member of the European Union under the Treaty of Rome – where there is no media pluralism, where a prime minister directly or indirectly controls the public and private TV and print media? What democratic electoral competition can exist in a country where a prime minister – a political party – controls the media? What democracy can exist in a country where a law that bans journalists from publishing judicial news is about to be approved in a matter of days? Forget about Watergate and the press upholding a regime! We are talking lapdogs here! What sort of democratic country wants to control the Internet? What sort of democratic country sidelines anyone who strays from the party line and fails to guarantee free speech and the right to dissent? We are not describing Sudan under Bokassa or Romania under Ceauşescu: this is Italy under Berlusconi, where such things are unfortunately allowed to happen, not least because the European Commission does not have the courage to adopt an independent and free stance with regard to the Member States. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to highlight the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I proposed together with four other MEPs, and which half of the European Parliament, plus one, approved, with the aim of committing the Council and Commission to legislation that is truly effective in fighting corruption. I have returned from a visit to Greece on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control and one of the reasons behind the Greek structural crisis is certainly the squandering of public money, something which also occurs in Italy: Italy is eaten away by corruption, as we have recently seen. This corruption mainly hinges on the illegal management of public money, and the relationship between one political faction and a faction of businessmen and white-collar organised crime. It is important for the European Parliament to make its full pressure felt on the Commission and on Member States – Member States that do not conform should be penalised – and for the European institutions responsible for controlling corruption and the fight against organised crime to be strengthened. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recently, there has been yet another environmental disaster in Italy, on the River Lambro and the River Po. Also recently, the Court of Justice in Luxembourg condemned Italy for endangering public health with their illegal waste disposal and their inability to control the collection of waste in Campania. An increase in cases of leukaemia has been reported recently in Taranto through the Ilva steelworks, as well asbestos removal in schools in Crotone and dioxins in Campania. It is an ongoing environmental disaster. I strongly ask the Commission what it intends to do to ensure that the Italian Government falls in line with standards of the European Union directives, particularly with regard to the recent ruling by the Court of Justice, which strongly condemned Italy for not being able to dispose of waste in Campania. For many weeks and months, the city of Naples was a laughing stock all over the world. Luigi de Magistris,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome and thank the President of the Court of Auditors, with whom we have worked productively during this period. As Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I have always maintained that the role played by the Court of Auditors is fundamental. It is fundamental because the Court operates in a very sensitive sector, which people throughout the European Union watch with great interest and with a critical eye where the transparency, accuracy and legality of expenditure and of the management of public funds are concerned. I believe that it must be reiterated today that the Court should always be guaranteed independence and autonomy when carrying out its work because this is fundamental if we are to be able to evaluate properly and to make good decisions. Likewise, we ask the Court to put Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control in a position to carry out their own work as productively as possible. We must find the right balance which allows public funds to be spent effectively and efficiently, because these funds are aimed at important objectives such as economic development and job creation. At the same time, there must be severe punishments for serious irregularities and errors, which the Court has also uncovered in the last financial year, whilst an attempt must be made to avoid unnecessary formalities and red tape. As Mr Kallas was also saying, Parliament must strive to find an equilibrium in the tolerable risk of error. The report, which we have read with great interest, provides some insights, but also includes many grey areas. We must strive to achieve the best results regarding these grey areas. As my fellow Members have also mentioned, the main problems primarily concern the Structural and Cohesion Funds. It is true that the Court, in doing its job, points out errors and irregularities in relation to these funds. However, those who are able to look deeply into and to analyse matters can see that, behind the errors highlighted, there are even graver issues, as the judicial experiences of several countries in recent years demonstrate. There may be fraud, there may be deception. I am specifically referring to one or two errors revealed such as the contravention of rules on procurement, over-invoicing and so on. We must endeavour to make improvements in this area. I believe that the Commission should promote Member States which behave in a virtuous manner, and punish and penalise Member States which do comply with the rules. Furthermore, I believe it is very important for OLAF to use the Court of Auditors’ suggestions as a starting point and to further improve its work because it is in everyone’s interest that it does so. I think it is only through cooperation among various institutions, namely Parliament, the Court of Auditors and OLAF, that we will manage to safeguard the financial interests of all EU citizens.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I must acknowledge the very important work accomplished by the committee and the excellent job done by the rapporteur, as well as the political solidarity that has been on show. This is because, from the outset, we wished to send a very clear message: we intend to work with great rigour to ensure transparency, accuracy and legality in the management of public funds and, therefore, in auditing the budgets. Very significant progress has been made with the Council, which at first did not want to respond. I would like to personally congratulate the Swedish Presidency on this. It has always set out to act to promote transparency and accuracy. From that point of view, we therefore expect further progress, because obviously it is absolutely unacceptable, particularly with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, that Parliament should not have the information and details required to monitor budgets and public funds, in the interest not only of the European Union but also of all European citizens. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 – (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening’s very interesting debate has helped us to understand some very important points, particularly concerning the European Crime Prevention Network. Firstly, now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament’s role in the framework of codecision procedure must be increasingly enhanced, and in two ways. First, culture: organised crime and mafia organisations can be eliminated above all with information and awareness. A great Italian judge, Giovanni Falcone, who was murdered by the Mafia, used to say that the latter was a phenomenon that had a beginning and an end. The end must consist of a huge mobilisation in cultural terms, and it must start in Europe and in Parliament. A second point is that organised crime must be combated more effectively, above all with the introduction of the European public prosecution service, and I think also with the inclusion of certain very serious crimes, foreseen only in certain Member States. I am thinking, for instance, of mafia crimes. We must understand that the mafia crisis concerns the whole of Europe, since mafia organisations have the capacity to penetrate right through institutions as well. There is a very close relationship between mafia organisations and corruption, as recent reports have also emphasised, and fraud in the European Union, as we were recently told by the European Court of Auditors too. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that Parliament should be very concerned by the latest report from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation. Indeed, while some governments in the European Union, and most recently the Italian Government, continue to make immigration a criminal offence, violate the right to asylum and indiscriminately refuse entry, I believe that we need strong cooperation since it is a disgrace that the level of poverty described by the FAO in Africa, the Middle East and Asia still exists. Cooperation does not mean undertaking pointless projects which merely generate business for the same old companies, but helping these countries to emancipate themselves. Another disgrace which Parliament needs to address is the privatisation of water, something in which certain governments of the EU engage. Water is a resource that belongs to everyone, an essential resource and not a commodity at the service of the multinationals. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
).  
– (IT)
 Mr President, I would like to talk about the tragedy in Messina – which the President of the European Parliament has recalled today – and its dozens of casualties. So another tragedy has been reported in Italy: the Italian Prime Minister has even claimed that it was a foreseeable tragedy. It may have been foreseeable, but nothing was done to prevent it. Nothing was done because the area is ruled by concrete, by the concrete mafia, by the forest mafia, with their forest fires. However, what the European Parliament should focus on above all is the way in which public money and also the aid allocated by the European Union can be invested in a different form of regional development, to ensure that construction work is carried out properly and the severe environmental damage that has been done can be rectified. More often than not, these public funds end up being pocketed by criminal societies, corrupt politicians and the Mafia. This legislative term must therefore focus on what happens to public funds, which should really be used to restore nature, to protect natural resources, to generate eco-friendly economic development and to create jobs. There must be no more horrific tragedies like the one in Messina. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important decision. The debate has become quite heated but that is because the industrial and employment situation in our countries is extremely difficult. This is an important decision in both real and symbolic terms, since we are dealing with a matter of principle. We must send out a sign of legality and respect in view of the all of the efforts being made by our business world. When I say ‘our world’, I do not mean it in a protectionist sense; I mean that the business community looks to the decision-making in Strasburg and Brussels with a feeling of belonging, searching for guarantees that only the Commission, Parliament, our institutions, can provide for fairer trade. However, we must tread cautiously: this is also a business world that looks at China as a great export opportunity, and that in certain sectors is actually managing to stay afloat precisely because of the market it has managed to develop in China. Thus we are not attempting to be protectionist and raise barricades. We simply do not want to be deceived, especially in an area such as photovoltaics, so crucial for our sustainable future. However, Commissioner, we must try to speed up this investigation so that any compensation can be estimated and claimed much sooner than planned. Moreover, since all of this debate is really about what to do in the wake of something that has already happened, we must also work on prevention. We should therefore strengthen the bilateral agreements to avoid any repeat of this kind of situation with China or other countries in future. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the list of tragedies in Cambodia is very long indeed: crimes against the environment, stratospheric corruption, waste of international aid, aggression against human rights activists, and a very shrewd dictator, who plays with democracy to give himself a semblance of legitimacy and who is still there. Now there is also the issue of the leader of the opposition, who is exiled from Cambodia. Yet I believe there is also another misfortune in that country, and that is an international community that is too obliging, and I have to say that that includes the European Union. Accompanying Graham Watson during our delegation’s visit to Cambodia, we felt that the Commission’s attitude was not sufficiently firm and robust. In Parliament, there is a robustness in the various debates on Cambodia that I would like to see in the other institutions too. Within the framework of European cooperation, I think it important to reflect on the case of Sam Rainsy who, among other things, won, through the efforts of the European People’s Party, an important human rights prize here in this institution. Perhaps that is the acid test, to try to have him return before the elections. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, well done to Russia for its accession to the World Trade Organisation, and I agree with the various boundaries set and the guidance given in the resolution. As a member of the delegation to the EU-Kazakhstan, EU-Kyrgyzstan and EU-Uzbekistan Parliamentary Cooperation Committees, and for relations with Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Mongolia, I would like to add something else that has not yet been mentioned in this debate, namely that Russia has made an effort to redraft its position both with respect to the WTO, and therefore the international community and particularly the Western nations and, through the Customs Union, with respect to the Eurasian countries. I believe we need to think carefully about the compatibility of the WTO and Russia’s accession to it, the new bilateral agreement being negotiated with Russia by the EU, and the Customs Union. I think this is one of the most complicated aspects. We do not yet know how the Customs Union will evolve, or whether as expected it will lead to a common economic area based on the four freedoms of movement that exist in the EU, but I believe that we should be taking an integrated approach to Russia on the one hand and Central Asia on the other. There is no point in creating antagonism between these two areas, bearing in mind the umbilical cord that links Russia with Central Asia. For example, we need to try to ensure that the Customs Union’s standards as regards safety and anti-trust rules are still in line with European standards, and I am also wondering what good the abolition of the visa system will do in these negotiations.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, in itself the Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is an excellent piece of work. It focuses on simplification, which is certainly desirable, but, to be frank, it would be naive to consider it a technical agreement. There is a long list of requests to the Israeli authorities from the European Union, from the High Representative, from our consulates in East Jerusalem, and from this Parliament on the settlements in the West Bank, on the continuing annexation of East Jerusalem, on the situation in Gaza and on the resumption of the peace process. If we look at what the EU has obtained with these requests, we see neither real progress nor any serious concessions. I therefore consider this to be anything but a politically neutral measure. My delegation will vote against the ACAA and I am calling on the Commission, should the ACAA be approved, to exercise the highest possible degree of oversight, both in terms of traceability of products to the Occupied Territories, which is a problem that has nothing to do with the good faith of the Commission but rather with Israel, and extension of the agreement to other products without the involvement of the European Parliament.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tone of this debate has changed since June, when we were among the few voices calling for a swift launch to negotiations for a free trade agreement. Japan has always been a very complex case, more difficult to deal with, understand and decipher than many other countries. We now find ourselves under strong pressure from the Member States and many sectors to move as slowly as possible in the direction of a free trade agreement, as if Japan were enemy number one of European industry. I urge the Commission to proceed with a dual approach. On the one hand, it must be firm, since we have included several conditions in our resolution that are entirely advantageous, with great emphasis on non-tariff barriers. However, an effort must also be made to ensure that it is used as far as possible to provide opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, to create the possibility of cultural cooperation with Japan – since as a country it is an ideal candidate with great potential in this area – and to undertake joint scientific research with one of the leading innovators. The second approach should be to make the agreement a success, since it is much more important than so many other agreements in geopolitical terms. It can serve to stabilise relations with South Korea and our economic and trade relations with China. Let us recall that we are dealing with a great democracy, and that this is one of the chief aspects of the agreement. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we support the proposal resulting from the compromise in the Committee on International Trade. We believe a very reasonable balance has been achieved. On one hand, we have a firm date, a deadline. I would ask you all to consider how absurd it would be to reject the committee’s proposal while we have obligations in the World Trade Organisation that we have to fulfil. On the other hand, we are allowing a couple of years more, thereby at least partly meeting the demands of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. I think this debate needs to be kept in proportion. After all, as the Commissioner pointed out in his speech as well, we are talking about an extremely limited volume of trade, although the decision we make tomorrow will be very important to some ACP capitals. There is a kind of asymmetry between the significance that we attach to what is at stake and how certain ACP countries perceive it. I do not believe that setting such a tight deadline – which might almost seem like an imposition, at least in the eyes of some ACP countries – is an effective way of bringing the negotiations on economic partnership agreements to a swifter conclusion. We do want these agreements. However, these partnership agreements need to be concluded in the best possible way, through persuasion and trying to win the other side round. These two extra years, if they are indeed both necessary, could be an opportunity for us to step up our negotiating efforts, not least by expanding the range of people we talk to in addition to just the governments. The general public in these countries remains somewhat wary, so we must also focus on the members of the national parliaments, who often do not ratify agreements but do carry political weight and influence in the debate in their countries and complain that they are not given enough information. As I proposed during our ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Horsens, it may perhaps be necessary to organise public seminars with the media and non-governmental organisations to explain our position properly. There is a Kenyan proverb that says ‘If you want to go far, go together’. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in November 2010, many of us asked the Commission to wait before signing the agreement and present an impact assessment first. The Commission decided to go ahead and sign straight away, assuring us that everything was fine, only to subsequently turn to the Court of Justice and receive a worrying warning from the EU privacy supervisor. Meanwhile, citizens in the EU mobilised in an unprecedented way, with 2.8 million signatures, whilst many entrepreneurs have reacted cautiously with regard to the future of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), precisely because they believe that existing laws can protect them just as effectively. I think that there are two lessons in this, and I hope that the Commission will learn from them with regard to the next measures announced by the Commissioner. The first lesson is that the Web is now considered by European citizens to be a real common good, like biodiversity or water. It is considered a space for individual freedom that must not be threatened by any kind of measure. In Washington, Senator Wyden, Chair of the Subcommittee on International Trade, whom I visited last February, told us that with ACTA, experiences such as Wikipedia
 might have not come into being. I do not know if this statement corresponds to the truth, but we must also adopt the precautionary principle. Secondly, we cannot implement important measures without the citizens’ approval, and there is a need for debate, which so far has been clearly insufficient. I think this should be understood and, if we do not understand it, I believe we will not go very far in today’s Europe. I became familiar with ACTA just after I was elected. I have followed this agreement as shadow rapporteur in a thousand debates in committee, in plenary, – and I have to say the Commission has always shown a very loyal and cooperative attitude – in interviews and in debates with civil society. I do not know if this will be the last debate. I must say that we will certainly be ready for further discussion and, Commissioner, I really do not hope that we will be able to say ‘acta est fabula’
, the play is over. This is in the public interest, in the interest of freedom of expression and, I must say, in the interest of the European institutions’ image as well. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there have been delays in dealing with this agreement in the Committee on International Trade (INTA), but there are many other very different kinds of delays on the ground with regard to improving the condition of the Palestinian population. This is a debate on how to prevent products from the settlements from benefiting from this agreement – this is a red line that cannot be crossed. I appreciate what the Commissioner has said, but it is also true that so far, we have not had any mechanisms that have worked. It is also a debate on the political impact of this agreement, because I believe, indeed I fear, that its adoption would be interpreted as opening a credit line in favour of a government that does not give much credit, so to speak, to questions from the European Union. No tangible progress in the resumption of negotiations, much less on the continued expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem, much less with regard – apart from some modest progress – to the Gaza blockade. For this reason, the treatment of this dossier is more than technical; it is a highly political dossier, not a trivial one, and we call upon the Commission to assess how a trade policy measure can, as is normal in this context, become a foreign policy act on the ground.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it would be a shame if Parliament and the Council failed to give the green light to negotiations with Japan, though this time around asking for something we have never previously asked for in similar situations. I agree with the rapporteur Metin Kazak: if there are no negotiations, Japan will look further east – as Mr Susta said just now – to the rest of Asia and to the Pacific rather than to Europe. Such a closure would be paradoxical for us, given that it is a fully democratic country, whereas we have ongoing negotiations with other countries that are dictatorships in one way or another, such as Vietnam or Singapore. Moreover, let there be no talk about the European crisis as a reason for holding back such negotiations. The crisis will not be defeated by clamping shut like a clam, through protectionism. The crisis will be defeated by open, intelligent trade, by a wisdom that we have perhaps not always had, and by basing our stance on reciprocity, as I – together with Mr Daul, Mr Guerrero Salom, Mr Susta and Ms Muscardini – called for in written statement No 0016/2012 on fair trade, which I invite you all to sign. In this case, it means not closing the door on Japan, but negotiating measures to ensure the removal of non-tariff barriers, bilateral safeguards for sensitive sectors – and we can strengthen such safeguards – the protection of geographical indications for our products, the removal of barriers that hamper trade today, especially for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which could otherwise find a further outlet in Japan, the opening up of Japanese public procurement to our companies, including SMEs, a mechanism for judging business disputes which today we are finding hard to put in place, as well as cooperation on post-Fukushima energy, based on sustainable development. These and other things we can ask for and obtain from Japan. We cannot agree with simply giving up from the start. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats fully supports the new generalised scheme of tariff preferences (GSP), which rationalises the mechanism and makes it more consistent with its constituent objectives of support for countries in the developing world. Congratulations to the rapporteur, Christofer Fjellner, who managed to strike a balance between the various options. There are now two commitments to undertake immediately. We need to coordinate the application of GSP with that of bilateral free trade agreements, first and foremost, so as not to alter the preferential nature of GSP for developing countries, which could even find themselves penalised by less favourable access conditions than those granted to the beneficiaries of bilateral agreements. Even more important is the monitoring of its entry into force, especially of effective compliance with international conventions on human rights, trade union rights, environmental protection and the rule of law. In this area, we have important news: the burden of proof is reversed, meaning it will be up to countries that are potentially non-compliant with these conventions to demonstrate that they are using the criteria of good governance and respect for human rights, by virtue of which they may enjoy this generalised system of preferences. The fact that information on this matter may come not only from the international organisations themselves, promoters of these conventions, but also from Parliament, the Council and especially from civil society, transforms this scheme into a much more participatory and democratic one. There are no less than 27 conventions to observe, including the United Nations one on climate change. This part of the scheme, without which this good work would, for the most part, be in vain, now needs to be fully implemented. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, in our view there are two basic elements here. The first is the issue of democracy, which means full involvement of the European Parliament in decisions on macro-financial assistance (MFA), its implementation and its suspension. Given that these are not technical or executive decisions, it is important that Parliament always be called upon to give its opinion. The second is political conditionality. As has already been pointed out, there is no point in setting up a European External Action Service if it is not fully involved in decisions as important as macro-financial assistance; there is no point in focusing on human rights and then failing to take them into account when making important decisions. I will add a third issue, which I regard as important: Central Asia is not mentioned explicitly among the beneficiaries of MFA, even though they are countries with which we have important economic relations. The European Union has its own specific strategy on Central Asia and it is vital that macro-financial assistance be one of its pillars. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, South Sudan no longer represents the good news we were still hoping for just one year ago. The peoples of South Sudan and of Sudan are enjoying neither peace, stability nor, least of all, development. ‘Walk on your own two legs, walk for a long time, find water and share it’, goes an old saying from the region, but this certainly does not reflect reality. Today, at the most, people walk for a long time but, if they have not stepped on a mine first, water is not easy to find until the rainy season. In fact, it is not easy to help Juba, just as it is not easy to put pressure on Khartoum. However, I believe that action by the Commission, the European External Action Service and the European Union ought to be based on certain fundamental principles. Above all, we must keep attention focused on this crisis, so that it does not risk becoming a forgotten crisis, one of those points on the agenda that is shelved and deprived of the attention of the media and the international community. Secondly, we must insist on full application of Security Council Resolution 2046, which is a key element. Thirdly, we must not be unprepared for what may happen in Khartoum, keeping in mind the fact that Sadiq al-Mahdi, former Sudanese prime minister, evoked the prospect of an Arab Spring in Sudan, in view of the failures both of the administration and of President al-Bashir himself. Let us therefore remain vigilant, to avoid a recurrence of what happened in North Africa. Fourthly, as we are the main donor to South Sudan, we should have more say in the application of laws in Juba. Currently, uniformed soldiers in South Sudan are appropriating land in an arbitrary fashion. The Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement must re-establish its credibility as far as citizens are concerned, which will be quite difficult without a minimum legal system that is effective and independent. This ought to be the European Union’s first priority. Without delay, I will finish with a final point, to which we have already drawn attention: the creation for South Sudan of a transparent fund to collect the proceeds of oil resources, as happened in Timor. Objections may be made that Timor was good news: well, we would like South Sudan to be good news too. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, Ms de Sarnez, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome this report by the vice-chair of the Liberal and Democratic group, a group that believes, perhaps more than others, in trade as a means of spreading well-being and stability worldwide. This is, nevertheless, a report that cuts to the heart of several matters, provocatively at times and without mincing words right from the introduction. There, it clearly states that, on the one hand, China is getting the most from its membership of the World Trade Organisation while, on the other, its economy is not fully recognised as a market economy. It is a slightly anomalous economy, run by the Communist party, with tariff and non-tariff barriers, discrimination in many sectors, subsidies, obstacles of various kinds, bars to participation in public tenders, export credits and much more besides. What is to be done, then, about China, given that it is a country with which we now have considerable economic and trade interpenetration? The first answer from this report is reciprocity, a principle that is seldom practised nowadays and is not easy to enact, but which is the key to this relationship. At the end of the day, is it really that difficult to make it happen? In recent weeks, with several colleagues – Mr Daul, Chair of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats); Mr Guerrero Salom, Vice-chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament; Mr Susta; and Ms Muscardini – we have been working on written statement No 16, with the aim of basing our trade policy on some key concepts: reciprocity, the agreement of environmental and social parameters, transparency, consumer protection, World Trade Organisation rules, and human rights. Tibet has already been mentioned. These are not slogans but values, which – as this report states – if put into practice in our trade relations, represent the best approach not only for sustainable trade, but also for a less extreme and happier China.

 Mr Martin, I believe that China’s membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is a good thing; it would be a mistake to have China outside the WTO, because matters would become much more complicated. Besides, the battles fought by the Commission, among others, within the WTO through various disputes – such as that on raw materials – have been very effective and satisfying. Furthermore, the WTO can certainly also be relied upon as regards various anti-dumping procedures. That does not mean, however, that we can lower our guard when it comes to granting China market economy status, on the one hand, or, on the other, that we should not exploit our own provisions, such as reciprocity, to demonstrate a firmer stance. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologise to the Commissioner – my dear friend. So, now is the time to give some practical responses to the Arab Spring. Europe has followed what has been happening on the opposite shore of the Mediterranean with enthusiasm. We have followed with enthusiasm, concern and a certain element of surprise what had happened and was happening during those months, and what is still happening with the difficult situations in Egypt, Libya especially, and of course Syria. Sometimes I – hesitantly – remember some of the statements by European foreign ministers who, not much more than a year ago, literally – and I remember this because it shows how far we have come – defined Gaddafi as an example of reformism for the rest of Africa, a statement made last February, and Syria as a country – and again I quote – capable of meeting its citizens’ need for modernity from its leadership. This is where we have come from. Another statement from February last year. In the end, however, with the support and empathy of Europe, the Arab Spring eventually emerged with difficulty, and it was a marvellous change. What has happened in the southern Mediterranean has been extraordinary, and is also a reason for great hope, but naturally there are a lot of difficulties ahead. What help can we give as Europeans? What can we do in practical terms to try and make these people taking steps towards democracy understand that economic development also offers prospects for a better life? We have two problems, among others. The first is that the potential for trade between the European Union and southern Mediterranean countries is definitely under-utilised. We are doing less than we could be doing. The report contains some figures, I will not quote them here, but given the geographical proximity and the fact that we all belong to a single area, Mediterranean Europe, the commercial policy figures are certainly rather unsatisfactory. The second problem is that traditionally we – especially the southern Mediterranean countries – have structured our trade relations in such a way that trade with Europe mainly benefited an elite, an oligarchy which often managed the flows from this trade in an extremely exclusive, if not selfish manner. The Arab Spring is trying to liberate political processes, and subsequently we also need to liberate the economy, in order to ensure that those who want to become producers and players in a global economic and commercial process in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Libya and the other countries really can do so, and can have a direct dialogue with Europe. This also means trying, also through a commercial policy, to provide practical help in a social situation that is sometimes desperate. In Egypt, revenues have fallen over 35% compared with during the Mubarak era. There is little investment, tourism is a resource that has almost run dry, and therefore we need new political tools, and here I think that in our work, we have proposed a series of practical elements to meet these expectations, and we will return to these in the final summary. Meanwhile, I would like to thank the Commission heartily for the constant support it has given me as well as the shadow rapporteurs. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to invite the Commission not to be too cautious, on the other hand, and, above all, I would like to invite the House not to be too fixated on the agricultural issue. We cannot carry on considering trade relations between the European Union and Mediterranean countries solely from the point of view of agriculture and, in fact, the report takes a totally different line. We asked for more connection with civil society, more study grants – and I would like to thank the Commissioner for what he said at the beginning on the development of the Erasmus Mundus
 programme – I believe – it is not an issue which concerns the DG Trade – but I believe that it would be useful also to have an Erasmus Med
, something specifically for the Mediterranean countries, as a written declaration from Parliament had, in fact, requested. We are calling for bilateral chambers of commerce between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries which do not yet exist. We are calling for new credit instruments, something – also through the work we have done with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) – is starting to happen, also for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and we are especially calling for liberalisation of this trade through the possibility of allowing new players and entities, like SMEs in fact, to emerge in southern Mediterranean countries. There is an extraordinary amount of talent in this area in the Arab countries that has always been suppressed by the oligarchies in power. In this sense, technical cooperation to dismantle non-tariff barriers – all elements of our report – is crucial. Let us not miss this opportunity. We have the opportunity to use commercial policy, the exclusive competence of the European Union, to do a truly political job, part of which has still not been done, in order to support these processes. There are those who say that nothing has happened, that there have been no Arab Springs. I challenge anyone in this House eighteen months ago to imagine that Mubarak, Ben Ali and Gaddafi would have fallen from power in their countries in the space of a just a few months. Something has happened, and the development and outcome depend also on us, and also on commercial policy instruments, and I must just briefly say a word about the contribution of our Green friends who have just left us: do not have an ideological approach. It is not true that commerce is not good for development, quite the opposite. The report demonstrates all the rest. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, after so much good news from Africa, what a lot of nasty surprises in Mali, a country which has even practised democracy successfully in recent years: we have had hostage taking, threats of secession from the North, the coup d'état
, fundamentalist gangs applying Sharia law, and the risk of famine; five problems, each of which is a human tragedy that is hard to resolve and, apart from anything else, these five problems are capable of contaminating the entire region. Mali is a collateral victim, partly of the conflict that took place in Libya, and finds itself caught up in an issue that is bigger than itself, bigger than the Malian political class. The real reasons have their origins outside its borders as well as in issues related to the conflict in Libya and, as has been said, even further afield. When, in our resolution, we call for a post-Gaddafi strategy for the entire region, we want political and security cooperation to be much more thorough, to go beyond contacts, and, in conjunction with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union and the United Nations in their respective roles, both food security and political security can be guaranteed, knowing that the later you intervene, the harder it is to find a solution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the many misadventures of Nigeria include the deaths of Franco Lamolinara and Chris McManus, two European citizens who were killed during the failed attempt to free them. This was a very sad episode not only because of their deaths, but also because of the way the operation was coordinated between the countries involved, and for the apparent absence of any European involvement dear Commissioner. Italy has complained about the lack of information about what was about to happen – and this is already one issue – but I must say to the Commissioner that the citizens of Europe need a visible face of our shared foreign policy that is able to face its responsibilities on behalf of Member States, especially where there is little coordination, as was the case in Nigeria. Today, many people are licking their wounds, the Italians who were unable to be part of the liberation plan, the British for a failed operation and Europe for having kept a low profile. We condemn terrorism, which is also a phenomenon totally alien to African culture, and call on Nigeria to do its utmost, but we must also learn what the EU’s responsibilities are, and quickly, if we want to be taken seriously by Europe’s citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the blessed sweetness of its finished product, the cocoa market has been practically cursed from the very start. When Francesco Carletti, a Florentine trader who was the first to circumnavigate the Earth using merchant ships between the late 1500s and early 1600s, brought cocoa to Europe, he denounced a business in which the main financing for investments in this plant was derived from the slave trade. Ever since then, the inhumane nature of the cocoa trade has persisted. If the product comes from Ghana or Côte d’Ivoire – which account for almost 60% of global output – then the use of children is a given, the majority of whom are less than 14 years old and often subject to genuine trafficking, which sees them taken away from their families in nearby countries and shut away in the plantations. Last week, I was in Côte d’Ivoire for an annual meeting of Euro-African liberal democrat members of parliament. There, I met the President of the main non-governmental organisation (NGO) that fights against the exploitation of children in cocoa plantations. The organisation is not without support, since even the wife of President Ouattara has come to its aid, opening the national surveillance committee against child exploitation and labour. That said, we need to move away from depending on volunteers, good examples and harsh words, and instead imbue the markets with a sense of social responsibility that has so far been lacking in the cocoa plantations, with their distinctive non-intensive, non-mechanical culture, and the aggravating factor of the use of pesticides that are harmful to workers. The agreement that has been signed – for which I should like to thank Mr Moreira and the Commission – is a step in the right direction, making the chocolate supply chain more transparent, involving NGOs and promoting fairer prices around the world. Since the EU controls most of the votes of importer countries in international cocoa organisations, it has a special responsibility to put the agreement quickly into action and use it as a way to make the production of this popular treat more humane. As significant as it is, however, this agreement alone will not suffice. We also need consumers to be more aware so that they can make ethical purchases, while also promoting the production and sale of fair trade chocolate, which guarantees prices for producers and that no children were exploited in the plantations of Africa during the process. The EU can do much more in this area, including by setting out regulations on (European) certification that has so far been a private initiative. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Menéndez del Valle, who I congratulate, is a very important document as part of the effort we are making, in the Committee on International Trade and in Parliament as a whole, to define new rules and provide a different impetus for trade in the Mediterranean. It is an essential task and one of the great challenges – taking advantage of the exclusive jurisdiction of the European Union on matters of international trade – to provide solutions to those countries that still today have vast untapped potential in terms of trade policy with us. It is not only a matter of bringing about greater stability and prosperity, but also of expanding the social and production base among those who may benefit from the trade policy. In my view, this convention should have three important effects: firstly, promoting South-South trade, now almost at a minimum in the Mediterranean; secondly, promoting market access for small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to operate what I call – as the rapporteur for another measure – ‘Trade for Change’, in other words, trade measures for countries undergoing democratisation in the southern Mediterranean – liberating economic and commercial processes in countries where the few oligarchies in power have centralised the proceeds from trade into their own hands; and finally, making this trade more readily understandable through simple rules. The problem of Israel must also be addressed because otherwise, the credibility of Parliament is at stake. This is an important work: we often wonder why we have only now managed to simplify the 100 plus different regulations governing rules of origin. It is now important for everyone to ratify it as soon as possible. What is happening with regard to the ratification of the mandate of the European Investment Bank for the Mediterranean is not very encouraging, given that Member States are proceeding very slowly. We hope that there will not be the same delay for the convention. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, to be perhaps a little provocative, we could have opened this sitting with a minute’s silence in memory of the more than 600 homeless people who have died this week from the cold. This is the tribute that we generally reserve for great and famous people. That would have represented an assumption of responsibility – perhaps the first by this Parliament – of great symbolic significance. In fact, what we are witnessing is that the instruments of participatory democracy for the defence of rights provided by the Union are incapable of being applied to the homeless, whether or not they are citizens of the European Union, and this is because, I am afraid, there is often no electoral consensus for this. The Vice-President, Mr Barnier, is quite right to remind us that this is a matter within the competence, above all, of the Member States. However, we are dealing here with a phenomenon that is ever more European, cross-border and visible. We therefore ask: what is the timetable for the strategy that we have demanded from the Commission on a number of occasions? How much – aside from the Progress programme – can be allocated from European funds, including the structural and social cohesion funds? We ask in addition: is free movement for the homeless genuinely guaranteed, or is it possible for a Member State to impose restrictions, precisely because these citizens –European citizens – may not have a fixed place of abode at their disposal? Finally, are basic support services guaranteed? Some Member States have refused this to citizens of other Member States, citing European regulations. Are we sure that this is legally admissible? In conclusion, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has established that every European citizen wastes 179 kilograms of food per year. What European strategy should we adopt to combat this waste? I consider that this is an economic and social issue but above all one of the identity of our own European Union. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the most visible aspect of the changes affecting Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (the BRICS), which is also the most significant one in terms of consequences for the life of our societies, regards the economic and commercial penetration of these emerging powers. These changes may lead to stability and widespread prosperity, but appropriate speed is required, both in terms of responses in the international rules – and we know that unfortunately the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations are at a standstill – and in terms of greater integration of our foreign policy with trade policy, taking into account the fact that our foreign policy in some respects is unfortunately still in its infancy, while trade policy, thanks to the exclusive competences of the Treaty of Lisbon, is fully functional. I am wondering, for example, what the role of trade attachés in our embassies is. These trade attachés are not part of the European External Action Service, but will play a key role in the BRICS countries, one that is as important, if not more so, as that of our diplomats.

 Mr President, I am honoured to have been the promoter of this plenary debate. I believe that European prisons suffer from at least two problems. The first is that it is quite difficult to have the instruments of European democracy enter these institutions. In prisons, there are human rights abuses and people’s dignity is mortified, as concerns both detainees and those who work in the prisons, such as the warders. Prisons are overcrowded, a sign of lack of investment: people are crowded in together and the door is shut. There is little knowledge of prison regulations, while copies of them should be distributed and clearly understood by all. There is abdication of the principal role of re-education that prisons should play, not least because employment for detainees is no longer facilitated inside prisons. There is little transparency and hardly any opening to citizens, schools and non-governmental organisations. Budget cuts threaten essential services and the training of personnel and there is an overall lack of interest by the media and politicians. I now go on to the second point. Personally, as part of the initiative that Marco Pannella launched in Italy, for the past three years, I have visited two prisons on 15 August – the day that is most symbolic of holidays – and I have been struck by the absence of the European dimension within them. There are no exchanges of good practices, and few are the moments of contact between the staff and operators from the various European countries. I therefore applaud the publication of this Green Paper, which may cast light on a series of issues: how to improve mutual trust and, naturally, detention conditions; how to associate detention conditions with European regulations on preventive detention, the European arrest warrant, the conditions of minors, the power to inspect, the right to visits by families and all the activities of cultural mediators, which are necessary. The Council is present today and many answers depend on it. We are dealing with a test of civilisation, that is, of European identity. Prisons will always be prisons. I do not believe that the solution lies in emptying them, but they must cease to be those dark corners of rights and European responsibilities. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, I shall begin with a poem by an Uzbek poet, Jogdor Obid (I translate from the English): ‘Little hands, little slaves dream of warm and sunny days, but suffer from coughs and tremble as they walk. Little hands and little slaves, children’s thoughts, dreams of tenderness, but it all ends up dead and buried’. This is the testimony of Jogdor Obid, describing cotton-picking by children in Uzbekistan. This took place in the period of the Soviet Union. Some things have changed, others have not. For example, the power structure has not changed: the Uzbek President today is the same one who, in 1991, was at the head of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Uzbekistan. Other things have changed: the situation of children in the cotton fields is worse, much worse. In other interviews, Jogdor Obid speaks of seven-year-olds who are slaves, being bought and sold in Uzbekistan to harvest cotton. This is an intolerable situation: our demands are the same as those already mentioned: access for International Labour Organisation (ILO) inspectors; for Uzbekistan to act in accordance with the values of human rights, which are, in fact, included in the country’s constitution; for the Commission to propose a traceability mechanism for the cotton harvested, free from the trade in children and their condition as slaves; again for the Commission, also on the basis of the ILO findings, possibly to decide the suspension of the Generalised System of Privileges (GSP) for Uzbekistan. We have done this with the Sri Lanka GSP+, and we could think of doing the same with Uzbekistan. Naturally, there will be no agreement on this protocol by the European Parliament, which can rely on its new Lisbon powers; at stake are the ever-stricter values of the European Union, not least as concerns our international trade policy.

 Mr President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, just yesterday the Italian statistics office reported that the figure for tax evasion in Italy in 2008 was between 16% and 17% of GDP, which comes to between EUR 255 billion and EUR 275 billion. With such figures there will never be any control of the deficit. In its annual report the Italian Court of Audit spoke of the cost of corruption for 2009 at EUR 60 billion, adding that we will never have any kind of growth. The income gap is widening, and we therefore have no social cohesion. I believe it is imperative for the EU to update its convergence criteria, also adding parameters relating to good governance and social equality. I should say that the verification carried out by the Commission on the tax shield of the last Italian government, that from our point of view violated a large part of the European standards on money laundering, competition and tax evasion – as well as on VAT evasion which, following our appeal, was proven to be correct – demonstrates lack of attention on the part of these institutions regarding an approach that should be fair and global.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s call to tighten up its budget brings a moment of truth for countries who have squandered and badly managed their own resources. However, it should also be a moment of truth for Europe with regard to growing social exclusion, and the need to denounce and resolve it. It is enough to read the Caritas reports and speak to volunteers committed to tackling urban poverty to understand the extent of the phenomenon which now affects even those who never thought they would find themselves in a soup kitchen or a hostel. It is enough to look around. A few weeks ago in Paris, in Place de la Bastille, I saw a homeless couple sleeping rough, with a new-born baby between them. There were others in Rue St-Antoine – so we are talking about a wealthy part of Paris – another couple on the ground, on cardboard boxes, with two children under the covers as well. I stopped to look at the reactions of passers-by and, over the course of 15 minutes, no one even stopped to look. The indifference of a large portion of our citizens is another face of this emergency. Last year, I spent a night in Rome with Emmaus volunteers. I learnt a lot, but I also discovered that they were scandalously alone. With this report, which the Italy of Values will support, we ask that a problem which we often prefer to ignore is not forgotten. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank the rapporteur, Mr Kósa, who has been as tireless as ever. This report begins by citing 40 or so official reference documents, including United Nations conventions, communications from the European Parliament and the Commission, resolutions, green papers and miscellaneous acts, which makes one realise just how much work has been carried out over the years on legislation, regulations, guidelines and recommendations in the field of disability. Moreover, this report puts forward a long list of objectives to further the inclusion of our fellow citizens with disabilities. I would like to mention two of these objectives in particular. The first is the participation of people with disabilities in the decision-making process, based on the principle of ‘nothing about us without us’. The second objective is to regard this subject as a human and civil rights issue, in other words, not an issue about a single group of people, but one that touches on the very identity of the European Union. The reality in Europe is very different, however, Mr President, because sadly, we are witnessing an increase in the suffering and pain of people with disabilities in our countries. We see structural funds that should be available but are shamefully left unused by Member States or local authorities, and we see infringements by these same Member States or local authorities that are not punished as they should be by the Commission. We see good practice in some countries, but unfortunately, it is ignored and not exported or valued elsewhere, and we see treatment that varies from one country to another or from one region to another within the same country, which limits considerably the freedom of movement of our fellow citizens with disabilities.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we could hear a small businessman or woman speak in this Chamber today, we would hear a story that is even more worrying than the details we have been given, especially because of the four structural problems facing this sector, which is a crucial sector and an integral part of Europe’s identity. The four problems are help for internationalisation, reducing red tape – we have heard about the hurdles that have to be overcome just to pay VAT in the various countries – innovation and access to the Structural Funds, which some Member States are not using as they should, and access to credit. Commissioner, it is unacceptable that Europe should recapitalise the banks without imposing strict conditions to make them facilitate access to credit for such a crucial sector of the European economy as small and medium-sized enterprises, which are now not being rewarded but held to ransom, if not crippled, by the credit institutions.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, we received a delegation of citizens who described themselves as ‘indignant’. Some have come a long way to get to Brussels, even travelling by foot from Iceland. Being indignant is the exact opposite of cynicism, indifference and resignation. It is a non-violent, transparent way of asking for the current European crisis to be tackled, rewarding the European institutions for being assertive and playing a leading role rather than being at the mercy of national governments, but, above all, it is a way of tackling this crisis with tools involving the real participation of the people. The European Union will have to take difficult, even unpopular decisions. Yesterday’s meeting was short but significant, because it showed that we need to exploit this crisis in order to rebel against the tribal fragmentation of Europe, which prevents it from having a shared vision, but, above all, it showed that we need to involve citizens fully in processes from which, to date, they have felt excluded.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support and thank the rapporteur for the outstanding work she has accomplished in committee, sometimes in circumstances that can hardly be described as relaxed. Trade between the European Union and the Palestinian Authority is minimal. We are certainly a long way from achieving the full potential of this relationship, and who knows when we will also be able to implement the sections relating to fishing, considering the dual illegality the Gaza Strip is subject to: the illegality of the blockade by the Israelis and the illegality of the control exercised by Hamas over the Strip. However, we are finally taking full responsibility for our relations, we are making international trade a fully-fledged instrument of foreign policy and above all we recognise the Palestinian Authority as a negotiating partner with full rights. Paradoxically we are doing this while at the same time, at the UN headquarters in New York, we are dragging our feet on the question of recognising its independence. Let us now hope for rapid implementation with good will shown by all sides. This should include ensuring we do not grant the products of the Jewish colonies any kind of special trade privileges, either as products declared as Israeli or as Palestinian products.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree to a large extent with my fellow Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). There is a degree of hypocrisy and also one of hesitation in what the Commissioner told us. In the 2010 communication, a paradox emerged in that the word Taiwan can neither be written nor spoken. Yet, it is a small China; very democratic and extremely vital both from a trade point of view and in terms of technological innovation. There is a very real principle which we must adhere to, especially in our trade undertakings. Taiwan exists and it exists de facto as a Sovereign State; Taiwan is a full member of the World Trade Organisation; we have excellent trade links with Taiwan and it is negotiating or will negotiate free trade agreements with several third countries. Something else is also true, which is that China, the People’s Republic of China, always responds with much irritation to our contact with Taiwan, nevertheless we do get the impression that it would be able to adapt with a certain level of pragmatism to a next step. Therefore we return to the original question, which we have still not had a compelling response to: is a free trade agreement possible with Taiwan, even at a lower or sectoral level? I think that this Parliament would be ready to support the Commission in such an undertaking. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Minister, Mr Nicolai, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that there are three things we can be sure of. The first is our deep friendship with the Palestinian people, a people that is suffering, that suffers every day. One has to visit the occupied territories to see the daily suffering of the Palestinian people, and this is a people to whom the international community owes a debt. The second certainty is the tie that binds us to Israel as Europeans, a tie that is probably stronger than that with any other country outside the EU, because Israel is an indispensable part of Europe’s cultural and moral identity; it is part of our family. The third certainty, unfortunately, is that Europe is always divided or highly conservative in its positions. These limitations are clear also in this vote at the United Nations, which will probably be another mortifying occasion after the absence of any European policy to speak of in the Libyan crisis, and yet it is only up to us, Minister, Commissioner. European citizens are finally asking for a qualitative leap, a position from Europe as a whole and, if possible, I hope there will be a position in support of the declaration of independence, as many Israelis too are asking, contrary to their government, and as Palestinians are asking from a basic sense of justice. Support for independence would first of all be in line with the reality of the Palestine that there is, that exists despite everything, and that no one can cancel from the maps. Its identity paradoxically grows stronger in the national sentiment with every day that passes, thanks to the occupation. In second place the security and the very identity of Israel would be strengthened. This security and identity are guaranteed more by the existence of two separate States with clear borders than by the prospect – and this is something we should ask the Israeli leaders in 20 years’ time – of a single State shared by Palestinians and Israelis. Finally, this declaration of independence would be a break with the stagnant waters of European diplomacy and the negotiations that are going nowhere. If we fail to embrace this break then we are condemning ourselves, after the financial crisis, to remaining on the sidelines also of international diplomacy. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I recall meeting an Italian entrepreneur a few years ago in Uzbekistan. He was trying – successfully – to tie up some contracts to sell the shoes that he made in what was not much more than a workshop, without knowing Russian or much less Uzbek, yet he managed it. This is a slightly unusual example because, in the end, while the European Union is a major international economy, on the one hand, on the other, 90% of our revenue is created by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), of which only 15% export to outside the European Union and only 30% trade outside their own country. Essentially, we are faced with a contradiction that reveals a profound vulnerability. The very concept of an SME necessarily implies the ability to be reactive and flexible – as shown by this Italian entrepreneur in Uzbekistan – and these skills also apply to internationalisation. However, this potential is largely wasted. We do not use the opportunities presented by the markets, by consumer goods and by the new lightweight technologies that we could use in public tenders – though in that situation with a certain wariness, because I think the public procurement sector is still the most difficult for SMEs hoping to internationalise. Unfortunately, the tools available to SMEs are obviously not suited to their needs, which is the very reason behind this debate. There are too many instruments and too much bureaucracy involved in using them, as well as a lack of multilingual skills available to SMEs – which is a significant obstacle – and insufficient training and information. That is why we are asking the Commission for a thorough revision of the measures to assist in the internationalisation of SMEs, as well as for a precise target. Let us set ourselves an objective along the lines of doubling the rate of internationalisation among SMEs in 10 years – something we can use as a yardstick for the new policies. That said, we also call on SMEs, because internationalisation – quite aside from all the objective difficulties and hitherto inadequate instruments – is also a question of culture, mindset, openness and keeping up with the times. The survival of SMEs, millions of jobs and the identity of our Union are at stake. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to return to the previous point, namely Prime Minister Berlusconi’s visit to this institution, because, as we have learnt, it is already the subject of jibes and ridicule. I should just like to know, Mr President – in the light of your explanation that there has been no official request for a meeting and that there will be no official visit by the Italian Prime Minister to the European Parliament – whether you will be meeting him and what the status of that meeting would be, tomorrow, during a visit which, I can assure you, most members of the public in our country regard as something of a mockery, given that the Prime Minister was due to appear in court in Naples tomorrow.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is in favour of this request; many things have happened in the Mediterranean this year, and I think that the events in Libya over the last few weeks deserve our attention. We cannot postpone the vote until such time as Colonel Gaddafi is captured, if he is captured – because this could happen soon, or it could take a long time. It is clear that the Libyan situation is an ongoing crisis. Europe has not always spoken with one voice in recent months on Libya; at times it has even been weak, and I believe that, with a vote, with an official pronouncement from Parliament, we can make a decisive contribution.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a debate that fails to inspire much of a reaction among people. The issue of the Doha negotiations is far removed from most citizens, the media, and even many governments, which are now busy dealing with far more pressing financial and economic priorities. This is not a debate that truly excites Brussels, nor even, it seems to me, Geneva, at least not from what I have seen this year, both in the WTO Parliamentary Assembly and in its steering committee, of which I am a member. There is an air of resignation about the fact that nothing is happening now, that nothing must happen, that nothing can happen, that the challenges facing a better-regulated and more generous global market are too complicated, and that the boundaries between the opposing blocs – between emerging countries that regard themselves today as powers and the former powers of old, which are now struggling, countries in constant transition, with an identity crisis – are themselves always shifting and vague. In other words, the ship that the World Trade Organisation – and, therefore, we too – are aboard does not know where it is heading, because, as Seneca wrote, ‘If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favourable.’ In the meantime, Commissioner, the poorest countries are losing out: they were encouraged to comply with international trade rules, and a good 32 out of 48 of them have joined the WTO, but what good has it done them so far? Theirs is a paradoxical situation: they account for less than 1% of international trade, but have 12% of the world’s population, people who are often forced to live without access to basic services. The forthcoming Eighth WTO Ministerial Conference has a duty to adopt at least – I repeat, at least – a package of measures to help them, and yet we have received no guarantees on that score – anything but. We call on you, Commissioner, to look into this matter. Although it would have no significant impact on international trade balances, the poorest countries would benefit greatly from measures such as the introduction of duty-free access quotas for their products, the simplification of rules of origin, the introduction of measures to correct market distortions in sectors such as the cotton sector, the provision of technical assistance to internationalise their economies and – an extremely important requirement for us members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – the extension of the TRIPS waiver beyond 2016 for pharmaceutical products and data protection. As far as we understand, none of this has been agreed yet. I understand your disappointment, Commissioner – we are disappointed too. We support you and the Commission in your commendable efforts. If there is no prospect of meeting the needs of the poorest countries, then we can well imagine the situation regarding much more complex issues, such as the balance between emerging countries, the European Union and the United States. If I am not mistaken, Pascal Lamy today inaugurated work on the construction of the WTO’s new headquarters in Geneva: this is a first step, and I must say that the need for proactive and industrious efforts to revive the work programme, objectives and the identity of international trade itself has never been so great.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this modification of the Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament we have an opportunity to uphold two principles, namely the transnational list, so that we have something more than an embryo at last, and a genuine step in the direction of European federalism, and we in the Italia dei valori 
party welcome the rapporteur’s tenacity in this regard. However, it is a mistake to think that the transnational list alone will reawaken the interest of the citizens, half of whom already fail to vote in European elections. We need innovative quality indicators that are in touch with society. We in the Italia dei valori
 party have proposed in committee to set a ceiling on MEPs’ mandates, in order to change those in office and create a process of renewal. This amendment was rejected – on rather ridiculous grounds, in my view – by MEPs instinctively seeking to protect themselves and their position. We are committed to making other changes for the next part-session: the first change concerns the regional dimension of elected representatives and constitutions – of MEPs – to ensure that they have a strong relationship with their home region, and the second change will be made both through the amendment tabled jointly with the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament – and I am grateful to Mr Gualtieri – and with a separate text aimed at ensuring a ‘clean Parliament’, as requested by the public. A ‘clean Parliament’ that prevents people who have received definitive sentences – and thus obtained all the guarantees of a fair trial – for extremely serious offences such as terrorism, corruption, organised crime, incitement to racial hatred, and so on from standing in elections. It is a disgrace that those guilty of such crimes should be able to sit in this House today. More courage is needed, ladies and gentlemen, and it is only with pioneering European rules that the European Parliament will obtain all the credibility it deserves. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the impression is that we are having difficulty bringing together all the possible instruments and making even small but tangible gestures. We have: political dialogue, trade policy, development coordination, immigration policies and humanitarian aid with separate managers, procedures and budget lines and sometimes Europe picks a card and uses the policy it likes the most, but we need to pursue every option to help whoever is most deserving and to update all the instruments. For example, trade with Egypt and Tunisia cannot continue with the same agreements for other countries in the region. A Mediterranean development bank is needed or, alternatively, the mandate of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could be extended, just as the European Investment Bank can finance small enterprises in Moldova or in Ukraine, but not in Egypt. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe reach the Caucasus and Central Asia, but there is no Mediterranean integration cooperation organisation. What initiatives do we intend to adopt in this direction? Is Parliament currently asking for a specific Erasmus programme for the Mediterranean and why is the Commission not rolling out this initiative immediately? An Arab employee of a multinational can obtain a visa for Europe, but a small Tunisian entrepreneur who wants to sign a contract cannot. High Representative, it is up to you not to waste any initiative and to consistently bring together all our actions from the many European Union bodies, otherwise, the change will take over and inspire the Mediterranean, but it will not have inspired us.

 Madam President, in addition to the opening of a delegation in Ulaanbaatar – something that we can no longer put off, not least because pursuing relations from Beijing is very bad for symbolic reasons – and in addition to the long-awaited partnership agreement, we are all aware both of the country’s mineral wealth and of its weaknesses in terms of social justice, even though Mongolia has, in its own way, developed a form of democratic cohesion. I would especially like to ask the Commission where Mongolia should be placed from a geostrategic point of view: it is not a country covered by the Central Asia strategy. I think, however, that some of the measures in this strategy could perhaps be extended to Mongolia, in view of its cultural history, which is similar to that of the other countries. The country also currently has observer status in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the European Union is examining the possibility of helping it become a full member, given the ancient cultural links that exist between Europe and Mongolia.

Madam President, it is difficult to oversee the final steps in the formation of a new country along a peaceful path. The ultimate objective – peace – must be safeguarded, but without losing significant pieces of the global agreement. Khartoum’s military action in Abyei appears to be jeopardising the good overall outcome of this journey, though not the founding of the 54th African state on 9 July. The South must not react to provocation and not lose sight of the final objective, which is not only independence but also the constitution of credible institutions and the advancement of its population, 90% of which lives below the poverty line. The people are unlikely to benefit from foreign investment, which already promises to be transparent and not predatory. I believe that this – the problem of foreign investment in South Sudan – will soon be a new front line that the European Union must monitor and on which it must assert the credibility it has earned in recent years in this region.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is something wrong about holding a debate in May 2011 on a natural disaster that occurred in summer 2010, a disaster that left 12 million people homeless and destroyed 20% of the country concerned. I do not support the socialist position, which was expressed by Mr Susta just now. It is partly due to this hesitation that we are still racking our brains trying to work out which instruments we can adopt in order to actively help Pakistan, and on top of our frustration at not having achieved that yet, we are also conscious that we need a trade policy approach that is more mature in political and humanitarian terms: trade policy must become one of the instruments for helping populations in difficulty. I admit that the Commission has acted swiftly and effectively by proposing a package of measures, which obviously needed to be discussed and rebalanced so that they did not penalise a European sector that has already been tested by the crisis. It is thanks to the work done by the Committee on International Trade, including that contained in certain amendments – among which the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports Amendment 37 – that businesses, too, can request application of the safeguard clause. However, it seems that these are bad times for Pakistan and that too many people are failing to face up to their responsibilities. We are asking India to change its attitude and to soften its ‘no’ stance at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as a tangible sign of good-neighbourly relations. True, relations are difficult between those two countries, since there was also the Mumbai attack and Pakistan’s poor cooperation in identifying and capturing the perpetrators of the attack. Yet that affair could be something that breaks the bad habits of a bad relationship between neighbours. We are also asking the Pakistani authorities for something, namely, to be more determined to consider this issue from a bilateral point of view in their relations with India. Bilateral meetings have recently taken place, though little has come of them, perhaps due to a pride issue on the Pakistanis’ part. It is clear that cricket diplomacy, emphasised by Pakistan’s Members of Parliament, whom we met just two weeks ago, has so far failed to produce meaningful results. Lastly, it is the WTO, above all, that we are asking – as we did in Geneva during the recent Interparliamentary Assembly – quickly to adopt mechanisms that will enable international trade rules to respond swiftly and flexibly to emergencies in a country hit by unforeseen disasters. This tariff reduction affair may end up achieving nothing, or it could open a new era in trade relations. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these negotiations are a little like the four-armed God Shiva, since it takes so much effort to conclude such a complex agreement. I am now going to explain the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Firstly: access to medicines. While I welcome the Commissioner’s statement, I confirm that I am against any attempt to implement protectionist measures in a sector in which Europe actually hindered access to low cost medicines in the past. Exploiting the issue of counterfeiting purely for protectionist purposes is about as low as it gets. The agreement should instead be an opportunity for the Indian and European pharmaceutical industries to cooperate with one another. Secondly: industrial sectors. We are asking India to allow sensitive sectors such as the automotive and alcohol sectors, in which our exports are today heavily taxed, to also feature in the agreement. Thirdly: agriculture. For our part, we declare ourselves willing to discuss agricultural products and to open up our market, but with a few conditions attached: obviously, we must say ‘no’ to GMOs and do everything we can to protect geographical indications. As regards this last aspect, I would remind you that geographical indications are not just a trade policy matter; they are also part of Europe’s identity. We therefore hope that a huge effort will be made to simplify registration procedures in India’s bureaucratic system, which is very onerous, perhaps even more onerous than the European one, which says it all. As regards public procurement, I congratulate the Commission if it is true that India seems to be prepared, for the first time, to include public procurement in an international agreement. Indian railways – to give you an example, 17 000 trains transport 18 million passengers every day, and there are plans to build a further 25 000 kilometres of track in the next 10 years – are one of the many markets that could potentially be opened up with this free trade agreement. If the negotiations go well, both parties will benefit: sustainable development will be promoted, child labour will gradually be eradicated and a more progressive form of social protection will be upheld. I feel it is pointless and detrimental to oppose this, and so I call on all the groups in Parliament to reject a priori
 a compromise text. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Schlyter for his excellent report on a sensitive issue on which a great deal of common sense is needed. Not all investment agreements can be replaced by European agreements, but not even the Commission can ignore agreements that infringe European provisions, and we agree with the rapporteur about placing the emphasis on transparency. Ideally, we should have a clause that automatically repeals the 1 200 agreements currently in force. Unfortunately, however, that would mean legal uncertainty for investors and too much work, perhaps, for the Commission. Our amendments in the Committee on International Trade have been successful, firstly, in ensuring that the Commission’s powers are fully respected and, secondly, in stating that legal certainty should be guaranteed. Some of the amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow in plenary may now alter this compromise and balance, and I call on my fellow Members, and the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs in particular, to come up with a balanced measure that is acceptable to all. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for time immemorial, if there is one trade that is difficult to control, it is the arms trade. There are various ways to make this control difficult. One is to trade in apparently harmless weapons or techniques that can easily become a weapon, and that is why we are concerned with dual use in the regulation. Another difficulty is the plethora of rules that make any control system ineffective. When we started working on this case, the Commission asked us to amend a regulation dating from 2000. Meanwhile, this has been revoked and we were called on to amend the more recent 2009 regulation on the basis of the same obsolete proposal. We have just entered trialogue and we already have a new legislative proposal from the Commission, again to amend the regulation. The first request is therefore to establish clear, simple and transparent rules for European exporters having a consolidated text. Four points on the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). With regard to shipments of low value, we in the ALDE concur with the Council in being very sceptical about this system. Parliament has already limited the maximum value from EUR 5 000 to 3 000 and imposed various other criteria. The list of destination countries is very limited. This is something that small and medium-sized businesses legitimately want, but our main message is that we want security above all, as well as trade, and we must go back to work on this in the trialogue. We support the policy of ex ante notification and the obligation of registration by Member States. Finally, we demand the maximum degree of transparency to ensure that the regulation provides a mechanism which informs stakeholders, such as human rights or peace monitoring and trade unions organisations, of the various stages that made up the decision-making process, including through a report to the European Parliament Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Generalised System of Preferences is one of the few methods of differentiation that works in favour of developing countries in international trade. It is a delicate instrument that must be used in the best way. Tonight we are talking about an extension, which means that the Commission date will be postponed once the new final proposal has been submitted. In the meantime, however, we are saying that this is a tool to be handled with caution, and that also applies to inter-institutional relations. Until now, even on the basis of the pre-Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament has not always been fully involved in decisions, as happened at the time of the discussions on Colombia or Sri Lanka that fired the enthusiasm of this House. We must also consider the merits of an ex-post
 evaluation of the decision to implement the regulation. What is the impact of the effects of a tariff reduction, what about its suspension, what are its mechanisms, what is its procedure? Sometimes an on-the-spot examination of these issues may reveal surprises and suggest the most relevant criteria to make the impact of the regulation as effective as possible. As far as the conditions are concerned, the world is changing and the instrument must show greater compliance with regard to those countries rewarded by the tariff concessions. The main concept of respect for human rights must be complemented by a broader vision in which, as noted by the rapporteur Mr Scholz – whom I thank for the excellent work he has done in this report – various indicators are taken into consideration: post-conflict rehabilitation, the specific situation of women, trade unions, the situation of recovery after natural disasters, environmental sustainability and compliance with international social agreements. If we were to adopt a combination of these criteria, I would not be surprised if the list of beneficiary countries we came up with were different from the current list and perhaps more deserving, but we will be able to talk about this again once we have the final proposal for a regulation.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you have already provided some information, Commissioner, but I would like more details. Firstly, the WTO. What exactly are we doing at the WTO concerning the initiative that was already taken in 2009 but which, as far as I know, concerned magnesium and bauxite? Do we have a procedure at the WTO regarding rare earths? Is such a procedure possible and do we initiate it alone, or can we initiate it together with the United States and Japan, as I think would be desirable? Secondly, you have said that we need to increase supplies from other deposits, including European ones. Is there a role for Greenland? What is the precise thinking in this respect? Thirdly, the recovery of rare earths from recycling. Are we moving towards a set of European rules on so-called urban mining? Will there be a directive or a regulation? What is planned in this respect? Fourthly, with regard to studies and investigation, the development of investigations, will we have some specific provisions in the Eighth Framework Programme also? Furthermore, with regard to the stockpiling system, will we have common European rules on stockpiling in this case, too? Finally, to what extent is the issue being dealt with bilaterally with China as part of the high-level economic and commercial dialogue and in the negotiations under way on the new partnership and cooperation agreement with that country?

 Mr President, Commissioner, this agreement contains a clause that does not convince us and has never convinced us. I am talking about the refund of customs duties that Korea will receive for imports of products from China or other countries. We have already discussed this, but as a liberal democrat I consider this measure to be deeply flawed. It is a kind of export subsidy, and I would like it if, when voting on this agreement, we had an assurance that this clause will not set a precedent and will not be included in any other future agreements. Tomorrow’s vote will conclude one leg of the journey we have undertaken together, but only one leg, because the relationship between Parliament and the Commission must continue, not least with regard to the actual implementation of the safeguard clause. For the sake of European industry and European workers, we cannot make any mistakes when implementing it, or else we will face great problems in future agreements. This is the Year of the Rabbit in the Far East, so I hope European industry will run like a rabbit, taking advantage of what this agreement can offer it. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start my speech with a statement supposedly made by the Italian Foreign Minister yesterday in Damascus, during which he said – listen to this – that Syria ‘is a stable country in which the population’s desire for modernisation has been satisfied’. Meanwhile, a few days ago, Italy’s Interior Minister made another statement in which he shifted his responsibilities to Europe, which has allegedly abandoned Italy ‘as usual’, he added with a hint of mischief. As usual, however, we are witnessing the habit of blaming Europe when it suits, only to ignore it irritably when Brussels disapproves of the agreement on sea repatriations, which violates humanitarian law and lines the pockets of African dictators – some of whom are today being toppled – and continuing even today to lavish billions on the Libya of Mr Gaddafi, or refusing EUR 10 million of aid offered to the Italian Government by the European Fund for Refugees, which Italy decided not to use, possibly because it would have to be spent in keeping with Europe’s transparent rules and not the in-house criteria of the Italian Civil Protection Agency. Therefore, I think that we will achieve nothing by acting like this and by making these declarations. The lesson of recent weeks has really not been learnt. Lampedusa reminds us that history is stronger than certain political games and recourse to declarations that create illusions. It reminds us that not everything can be bought with money, that Europe is not something that can be called upon when it suits, but is a project that must be committed to each day, demanding rights and solidarity but also respecting the commitments undertaken. In order to slow down migration in a sustainable and purposeful way, five things are needed: democracy, development, respect for international law, European solidarity and also, above all, no prejudicial rhetoric.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am a liberal democrat both in Europe and in Italy. Sometimes, however, in my country, my fellow party members and I are called communists merely for opposing the current government. It seems that the same thing is now happening to our colleagues in Bulgaria, with liberal democrats and socialists being called criminals simply because they represent an opposition force in their country. We disapprove of this move, because if it is a joke, then it really should only be a short one. Behaviour of this kind can become really dangerous in the end. In addition, after everything that has happened in Egypt and Tunisia, only yesterday, the Italian Foreign Minister visited Damascus in Syria and called it ‘a democratic country that completely satisfies its citizens’ need for modernisation’. If our representatives make speeches like this, it is our duty as Members of the European Parliament to denounce them and the Commission must keep a close watch. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I began working at the European Parliament as a political adviser in 1991 and at that time the conflict between northern and southern Sudan was already a recurring crisis. Finally, after 20 years, it seems we are seeing a bit of light at the end of a long, arduous tunnel. As Mr Milana and others have pointed out, much still needs to be done, but many of us were preparing for the worst and expecting the civil war to start up again. I therefore congratulate the north and south of the country on this initial referendum result. Every day counts now until the declaration of independence. No-one can allow themselves to put a foot wrong, either in Khartoum, in Juba, in Brussels or at the African Union in Addis Ababa. For example, the idea of opening an EU delegation with special status until the declaration of independence is definitely to be welcomed. Sudan is about to teach us,the international community, a wonderful lesson about cynicism and about crises that, more out of a sense of resignation than anything else, we often consider to be unsolvable.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the fate of Eastern Christians is changing the map of cultures, with communities thousands of years old – ‘Copt’ means ‘Egyptian’ in Greek – now looking to emigrate overseas to escape from the violence they have been suffering. However, the media or xenophobic parties should not make the mistake of calling this a clash of religions or a clash of civilisations. I would like to recount a short incident that I find significant. Years ago in Cairo, an old man from the countryside who delivered milk to our house three times a week stood at our door crying. We could not understand what he wanted, as all he could say through his tears was ‘Said Akbar
, Said Akbar
,’ the great old man, the great old man. We eventually realised that he was showing his Christian customers his grief at the death of Karol Wojtyła, who had just passed away. This was a simple, sincere man, a Muslim who acted with all the ancient mutual respect of the Mediterranean peoples. This short but significant incident, reflecting widespread values in Egyptian society, happened in the same country in which the Copts were massacred at Christmas. Today, however, Eastern Christian communities need protection. They are sometimes trapped in the settling of scores between terrorists and fundamentalists and authoritarian powers. European foreign policy should not remain powerless while the world changes. It should not be afraid to say the word ... (The President cut off the speaker) Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it really is true that Haiti is a case apart, that it is different, because anniversaries of disasters are always commemorated in order to remember the victims, to learn from one’s mistakes and do better next time, but it is different in Haiti because there is nothing to remember – nothing has happened yet. Instead of saying one year after
 the earthquake, we should actually be saying one year of
 earthquakes, because there was the seismic earthquake, then the earthquake with regard to the shambolic aid distribution, then the health earthquake with the cholera outbreak, then the political earthquake with the non-transparent elections that were held at probably the worst possible time, and now the earthquake that is, in some respects, historical too, with the return of the former dictator in the guise of a dubious multi-millionaire tourist. The Commission is doing good work – very good work, in fact. I visited Haiti last June with the Committee on Development and I saw the excellent work being done, for which we thank the Commission. However, there needs to be greater political protection and an enhanced role for the international community, which must set targets and deadlines and must directly oversee part of the reconstruction. This must be balanced with the increased involvement of the population and local NGOs, which are often frozen out instead. A lesser role for the national politicians and national government institutions of Haiti, then, and a greater role for the so far fragile partnership between its citizens and the international community.

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Côte d'Ivoire is a test case and a test case we cannot afford to fail. This applies to the European Union above all because there is no way we can acknowledge a stolen victory but neither is there any way we can stop exerting maximum pressure on the Ivorian leaders over this massive fraud. Furthermore, it will not be acceptable for a single euro from European taxpayers to end up in or even pass through an illegal government that disregards even the most elementary rules of democracy. Côte d'Ivoire must be made aware of this. Côte d'Ivoire is now also a test case for the African Union, which is dealing with the situation in a very interesting way, so far showing a degree of firmness and unity that would have been unthinkable only 10 or 15 years ago. This is a sign that the Ivorian affair should not be exploited to revive old stereotypes of black Africa being incompatible with democracy. Even though we hover on the brink of widespread violence, which would be catastrophic, Ivorian society is so far also passing this difficult test: it gave a majority to the reformist candidate Mr Outtara and appears to have learned the lesson of the great Ivorian writer Ahmadou Kourouma, who in 1998 published a book with the apt title ‘En attendant les votes des bêtes sauvages
’ (Waiting for the Wild Beasts to Vote), which tells this very story from a democratic and very Ivorian standpoint Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are only a few of us here this evening to talk about anti-dumping, which is, however, an issue we speak about a great deal in our own countries. I believe that there is no issue in international trade that business people, small and medium-sized enterprises, trade unions and consumers care more about than dumping. Dealing with dumping is basically a daily task for a large part of our productive economy. The Commission is working hard and is certainly doing its duty when it comes to anti-dumping initiatives, but we are calling for action based on the following principles. Firstly, transparency of action, full transparency of procedures, of the evaluation criteria adopted and their results, and then communications and a communications strategy, because the actions taken on anti-dumping by the European Commission can serve to reassure our business people and workers. Secondly, there is space for the exercise of discretion in anti-dumping procedures. This is common sense, but sometimes I have the impression that too much discretion is exercised in the decisions that are taken. Thirdly, following the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament must be better integrated, involved and informed. It seems to me that there the Commission is labouring somewhat to recognise Parliament’s role in international trade – even though much effort has been made, for which we are grateful to the Commissioner – and Parliament certainly needs to have a stronger voice on anti-dumping as well. Lastly, there is the question of dialogue with society. Once again, perhaps, the Commission still has much to do on this issue. Parliament cannot merely sit and listen to the players in society, including in anti-dumping matters. In this respect, the Commission should probably take note of the new requirements with respect to the exclusive powers on international trade recognised to it by the Treaty of Lisbon. Lastly, it is clear to us that anti-dumping must be part of a coherent commercial strategy and an integrated policy based on the criteria of honesty and openness. Bearing this in mind, Europe will be able to move forward with its head held high. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first the epicentre of a terrible earthquake, in precisely the poorest and worst-governed area in the American hemisphere, and now cholera in the country which receives one of the highest amounts of per capita international aid. What a contradiction! It is not just a terrible combination of bad luck: in Haiti, in the streets crowded with children and tents crammed in amongst the rubbish, no one knows where to begin. The local political class is often greedy and focused on power games rather than taking control of the reconstruction efforts, and the bureaucratic machine, decimated by the earthquake, has a weak administrative culture and, in some cases, has even obstructed the distribution of aid. There are many, often badly run, international organisations and, in fact, they have failed to protect the population. Visiting the country with the European Parliament delegation in June, the concentration of abandoned fields, rubble which had not been removed and rubbish already gave a clear indication of how bad the situation could become. Now cholera is here. The Commission and the Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) have so far done what was required, but they must now redouble their efforts. My feeling is that now, as well as strong recovery action, Haiti needs greater protection at the international political level. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today marks a fork in the road between two crucial principles. On the one hand, there is the duty of solidarity towards a country that has been hit by natural disasters, bringing its society, which already has structural problems, to its knees. On the other hand, there is the necessity for a balanced trade policy. With the European Commission’s proposal to suspend duties for Pakistan, the European Union is rightly avoiding a policy of mere humanitarian aid, allowing Pakistan to strengthen its economy and therefore its society. The fact that all 74 of the tariff lines involved relate to the textile and clothing sector is almost inevitable for a country that can export only products within this sector. We liberal democrats definitely prefer recourse to this kind of measure, rather than agreeing on humanitarian aid which is incapable of giving the country a genuine boost. However, as Mr Melo reiterated a short while ago, we must not be naive and we ask the Commission – above all – not to make the mistake of naivety. The Commissioner is well aware of the critical situation in which some textile districts, such as Prato, find themselves. Prato is a special case: The situation there has gone out of the control of the national authorities and there is widespread illegality, which is also exacerbated by the crisis in the European textiles sector. Since we believe that it cannot be just the European textiles sector that pays for our rightful humanitarian solidarity with Pakistan, we ask for three things to be done: 1) To set up regulatory instruments to avoid all possible triangulation with other countries that could profit from the duties from which Pakistan is benefiting; 2) Not to aggravate the crisis in the European textile sector, by implementing measures that could instead support it, such as a reduction in the cost of electricity; and 3) To avoid creating a precedent for other countries that suffer such natural disasters. By working in this way, I think the aid for Pakistan is shared and sustainable, including in the long term, and that is what that country needs. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Madam President, if you were to visit the Ponte Rialto
 in Venice – perhaps with Commissioner De Gucht – and wanted to buy a pair of shoes advertised as Italian, a tie, a traditional mask or a glass from Murano, there is a chance you will be ripped off, realising that the product purchased was not made in Italy at all, but in some country in Asia. I believe that the proposed regulation under discussion is beginning to inject some order into an ever more confused global market. It seeks to protect the consumer – including you Madam President, and Commissioner De Gucht, if you go shopping on Venice’s Ponte Rialto
, or elsewhere – as well as the European industries that have not relocated (whilst those that have will be penalised by this regulation). Above all it will correct the asymmetry on the trade markets, which sees Europe as the only large area lacking a regulation on compulsory origin marking. This is not a protectionist proposal; in fact, I find it to be very balanced. It only applies to a limited number of products, to the final product destined for the consumer, and – as far as my group is concerned – it is a 5-year pilot project because we shall support the amendment with the sunset clause. In addition, we also introduced in committee – through an amendment of my own – a provision that aims to avoid any excessive bureaucratic burden that would harm businesses. If the vote tomorrow is satisfactory, it will mean that one stage has been won, but it will not be a conclusive victory. We shall then need the full support of the European Commission in our dealings with the European Council. The Commission has already been full of suggestions and very cooperative, for which we are grateful, and this is a reason why we must continue to work together. I am sure that in five years, we shall be satisfied by the result we have obtained. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations have been difficult, with strong opposing opinions as well as different interpretations of the consequences of this agreement. As far I as can make out, the current status of the negotiations provides for an imbalance in the treatment of geographic indications and marks, in favour of the latter, as well as the failure to act, in violation of Article 22 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of International Property Rights, on marks that use denominations protected by geographical indications. ‘Parmesan’ – one of a number of possible examples – can be freely produced as ‘Parmesan’ in the United States and Australia and exported to China or elsewhere in direct competition with European products, one of the strengths of which is geographical indications. Consequently, European products seem to be propping up unfair competition without any effective protection from the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. I should like a clarification in this regard. ‘Parmesan’ means ‘from Parma’, not Australia or the United States, and this applies equally to all European geographic indications. We must be careful because if, in the course of 21st century globalisation, in a few years’ time, we no longer have our geographic indications, it will partly be because of today’s mistaken choices and we shall lose an enormous piece of our identity. In this regard, if all that were permitted by the ACTA, the agreement would be unacceptable. There is also the question of the Internet, as already mentioned. The European Union is in favour of a society of widespread knowledge, open to all, and the ACTA must not in any way constitute a restriction on the freedom of access to the Internet. Much has been gained on this issue. The Commissioner has given his important assurances, but it would be unacceptable if the acquis communautaire
 were tarnished, as still appears to be the case, by the possibility of legal injunctions provided for by Article 2, and by the possibility of criminal sanctions, including for individual users, as provided for by Article 2(14)(1). I appreciate the highly important assurances on access to medicine for developing countries, but we know that the list of countries adhering to the ACTA is very limited and excludes the great powers of counterfeiting, in Asia, in particular, but not only there. So for this reason, given everything we have to lose on geographic indications and risks on the Internet, the impression – for now – is that the agreement represents only a disadvantage and on this basis, perhaps it is better to let it drop.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs De Keyser has already said nearly all there is to say. I would like to dedicate this minute to a baby boy who I met on 1 December 2009 in Luanda, when we were in Angola for the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly. The baby boy was at the end of his life, he was dying due to malnutrition in his mother’s arms in the Divine Providence Hospital in the centre of Luanda, near the place where we were doing our work and near the stadium that was being built for the African Cup; in other words, he was surrounded by plenty. Yet this was not an isolated case: every day in Luanda, children are still dying of hunger, due to malnutrition, in the arms of their young mothers who have not been taught anything about nutrition and who are often left to their own devices. For a Christian, sights like this constitute a sin – a great sin; for a politician, they are a sign of the failure of our policies; and for the ruling class of that country, Angola, they are also a sign of greed and the unfair distribution of wealth. I believe the reasons why that child had such a fleeting existence on the earth give us much food for thought and I hope my testimony will contribute to this reflection. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a summit between China and the European Union is a model affair between two friends who have mutual reasons for satisfaction. In certain respects, they go back a long way, because Europe and China have both contributed to a safer and more prosperous world. Trade policy represents a crucial factor in this combined effort, even if something is not working properly, and even if it is true to say that over the last five years, the European trade deficit has tripled. This is not sustainable for the European Union but perhaps inevitable, due to China’s constant social and environmental dumping, its world record for counterfeit medicines, its market that is closed to services, its unwillingness to take part in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and its instinctive reaction to conduct a closed policy, even with regard to human rights: from the oppression of Tibet, which is culturally, spiritually and ethnically stifled, to this obstinate refusal to recognise the de facto sovereignty of Taiwan, the repression of freedom of expression in the media and on the Internet and the shameful systematic use of the death penalty. All this is old politics to us – and we are bound to say this to our Chinese friends – because why should we offend the intelligence of a people whose civilisation has always kept pace with the times? We have little to teach China. Quite the contrary: all the competitive clout wielded by the Chinese, including in trade policy, derives from the fact that China has 1.5 billion inhabitants and one Foreign Minister, 1.5 billion inhabitants and one fiscal policy, 1.5 billion inhabitants and one currency, and the Europe of 27 + 1, which constantly falters in its dealings with China, still has a lot to learn and must recover its unity.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, discussing the problems of sparsely populated areas and of the outermost islands in this Chamber – especially in the light of my parliamentary commitment to mountain regions – is the first step towards creating a network to preserve these regions, in which European citizens live in completely unique conditions and often on low incomes. These are sparsely populated areas with low population density in which there is a phenomenon of ageing populations, because the young people often leave, and a percentage of graduates that is below the national average. These criteria, particularly GDP, but there are others too, need to inspire a European support strategy for mountain regions, which have fewer services, infrastructure problems and which are particularly vulnerable due to the agricultural crisis and climate change. Mountains are places in which people live and which they study, and today they must also become a political laboratory, because they are an immense resource for cultural, clean energy and quality agriculture development, and for the quality of life that is indispensable for guaranteeing greater well-being among urban populations. Beyond the Commission, the Member States and the local authorities, it is the responsibility of local communities, too, to understand how to control their own destiny in 21st century Europe, with an integrated approach and especially active participation in decision making. I speak from experience when I say that in mountain regions, it is better to organise 10 local sporting events than one single World Cup, and this should be the working method for everybody: we should increase the number of widespread initiatives and demonstrate greater political creativity, starting with the creation within the College of Commissioners of a specific delegation for mountain regions and islands.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mr Kazak’s report which basically tells us that the European Union has a remarkable instrument in its hands to further develop its relations, including its political relations, with Turkey: the commercial policy. The crucial geo-strategic position of Turkey for the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Central Asia and the Caucasus has already been noted. There is a beautiful poem by the Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet which goes: ‘this country shaped like the head of a mare coming full gallop from far off Asia to stretch into the Mediterranean’. We would like the mare that is Turkey to be a true fulcrum of the relations with these regions, of which Turkey is one of their centres. However, to make this happen, political and trade relations with Armenia need to be stabilised, the Cyprus question needs to be closed, and I would highlight paragraph 11 of Mr Kazak’s report on the actuation and application of the customs union with regard to the part of Cyprus occupied by Turkey. So not everything is perfect. Mrs Balzani also pointed out that there are some problems, especially in the areas of counterfeiting, the defence and protection of intellectual property, and the application of the customs union to the services sector and to procurement. I would like to thank Mr Kazak. The Mediterranean is destined to change and we want to change it together with Turkey, which, according to the International Monetary Fund, is expected to experience growth of some 37% between now and 2020, which tells us all we need to know.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘acta est fabula, plaudite!
’ – ‘the play is over, applaud!’ – as Roman actors used to say at the end of a performance. The play is over and perhaps we are on the eve of its conclusion, although it may not yet be time to applaud. During this debate, we have been given important reassurances by Mr De Gucht, but we know that 64% of counterfeit goods come from China, which is not a party to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). We will therefore need to assess whether it is all worthwhile – in other words, whether we ought to sign the agreement if it does not bring any real benefits, as the Commissioner concluded. There are not many causes of concern remaining, but they are significant. A lot has been said about the Internet, and we appreciate the Commission’s efforts, but we remain vigilant. As regards access to medicines, I repeat what has already been demanded by other Members: there can be no lumping together of counterfeit medicines on the one hand and generic medicines on the other. It is vital to allow access to medicines at competitive prices, which are crucial for patients in developing countries. The question I should like to ask is whether the Doha declaration on the TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement and public health will be included at least in the preamble of the ACTA text. Lastly, as regards geographical indications, we find ourselves in a potentially paradoxical situation, because registered trademarks that might violate geographical indications would enjoy greater protection than the geographical indications themselves. Here, too, TRIPS provides a sounder basis in many respects, and we therefore call for vigilance and a firm stance. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are a little like the Ryong, the dragons of Korean mythology, which are gentle, benevolent but highly determined dragons. We are also aware that we are the European institution that is directly elected by our citizens, and we therefore call for an effective safeguard clause. Parliament is willing to conclude the agreement at first reading, but on condition that there are concrete proposals taking account of the interests of European workers and industries and especially of Parliament’s institutional prerogatives. We have six demands, which have already been put forward in part by other Members. The first one is no provisional implementation before the safeguard regulation has been adopted and before Parliament has given the agreement its approval. The second is a regional or, in any case, a flexible safeguard clause, because Europe is diverse and it is important for the agreement to be accepted and welcomed by its various stakeholders. The third and even more important demand concerns Parliament’s role in the procedures: the right to call an investigation – we have, of course, asked to extend this right to industry – the right to be given full information, and access to the online platform. The fourth concerns comitology in implementation of the regulation: the Council cannot have a greater role than Parliament. We insist on Parliament having a strong role, with a procedure – the advisory procedure – providing for a veto in cases where the Commission decides not to apply measures after an investigation. Fifthly, with regard to customs duty drawback, customs duties must be included in the safeguard clauses and must be one of the factors in any investigation and monitoring. Lastly, the sixth demand is that there needs to be monitoring of social and working conditions and environmental standards, and there needs to be a level playing field putting the Koreans and Europeans on an equal footing as regards CO2
. We are fully in favour of this Free Trade Agreement and of any Free Trade Agreement that is an instrument for stability and peace. Nobody, however, should be naive about its content, nor can the Council ignore Parliament’s role. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we do not want any more pogroms in Central Asia. Central Asia is a region that presents a high risk of interethnic conflicts. The peoples are very mixed, and the borders were drawn up under the Stalinist regime. Just consider that Kyrgyzstan has a Kyrgyz exclave in Uzbek territory, and there are four Uzbek enclaves in Kyrgyz territory, including one that is inhabited exclusively by Uzbek citizens living in Kyrgyzstan who are of Tajik nationality – this shows the complexity of the situation. We now have 300 000 people who are displaced. One hundred thousand people have taken refuge in Uzbekistan and very many have died: we do not even know how many, possibly even 2 000. What can be done? First of all, as the Commissioner stated, it is very important to guarantee justice, because – as the experience of other countries demonstrates – there can be no reconciliation without a form of justice. Therefore, we need to persevere with this committee of inquiry. The second point: while continuing to provide humanitarian aid, we also need to deal with a number of political issues. Mr Swoboda mentioned one, namely, that we must confirm to this interim government that it is, in fact, doing a good job. The referendum was a success not only from the point of view of its content, because it redresses the balance of the relationship between the Presidency and the parliament, but also because of the way in which it was organised and because of its high turnout. I would also like to understand how we Europeans should respond, if we do respond, to the OSCE request to send international police forces: shall we leave policing entirely up to the Russians, or will there also be a European contribution? The third point: what is the United States doing? It has a very large military base in Manas, but it seems to me that US influence in Central Asia is declining in general. I think it is important for us to harmonise certain issues with the US Administration as well. As for the 27 July donors’ conference mentioned by the Commissioner, I would like to understand what Europe’s priorities are here. I believe that we need to invest, above all, in education and in strengthening the civil society that exists in Kyrgyzstan. It is active, as the high turnout at the referendum showed. I would like to conclude by emphasising that the European strategy of taking a regional approach to Central Asia is certainly the right one. This is a region that needs to be considered in its entirety. I think that in the medium term, we will gradually need to apply this strategy to Afghanistan, too, because we cannot have one policy for Afghanistan and another for the countries of Central Asia – for the other countries of Central Asia. This is a paradigm case for the prevention of conflict, a little like what EU-FAST turned out not to be for Haiti, through the coordination of civil and emergency protection. We now have the legal instruments: the citizens wanted them, and we need to prove that we are up to the challenge. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I am in favour of this proposal because it aims to bring the new psychoactive substances under the same criminal law provisions as other substances controlled under the UN conventions. Psychoactive substances, like many other drugs, are a threat to society, affecting the functioning of the brain which creates symptoms such as changes in consciousness, behaviour and cognition. Tackling the distribution of psychoactive substances is not to be underestimated. Though Member States do have their own policies on tackling illicit drugs, when psychoactive substances are being distributed from one Member State to another efficient cooperation between Member States is indispensable, especially in an era when commerce and communication are no longer limited by physical and geographical boundaries.

 I support this proposal as it empowers the Union to take steps to protect cultural national treasures, in the context of the opening-up of the Union’s internal borders. This acknowledges the need to provide cultural objects special protection in the light of the rules governing the internal market. In addition this proposal aims to improve cooperation between the national authorities responsible for matters related to the return of cultural objects. For this reason it is proposing that authorities should make use of a new EU administrative cooperation instrument: the Internal Market Information system (IMI). The IMI is an electronic tool designed to improve communication and cooperation between the authorities of the Member States in the context of the implementation of internal market legislation. That will make it possible to share information about national treasures and stolen cultural objects, it will provide secure internet access, and will be used in all the EU official languages.

 I am in favour of this report because it aims to ensure the efficient monitoring of the crossing of external borders. It is fundamental to set strict rules for the search and rescue operations and on the identification of migrants intercepted at sea in order to enable Frontex to respond more effectively and to prevent deaths at sea. The “operational plan” governing Frontex-coordinated border surveillance operations must henceforth include procedures to ensure that persons needing international protection, victims of trafficking in human beings, unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable persons are identified and given appropriate help. Furthermore, through the sea operation, the participating units will address the special needs of children, victims of trafficking, persons in need of urgent medical assistance, disabled persons, persons in need of international protection and other persons in a particularly vulnerable situation throughout the sea operation.

 I support this report, because I believe in the importance of improvement of transparency and predictability of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations. The parties affected by the imposition of provisional anti-dumping and countervailing measures, in particular, importers should be made aware of the imposition of such measures. This proposal aims at modernising both the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations, entails four central changes: the removal of the lesser duty rule in anti-dumping cases where structural raw material distortions are present and in all anti-subsidy cases, the obligation for Union producers to cooperate in ex-officio investigations, the reimbursement of duties collected during expiry reviews, and the two weeks' notice before provisional duties are introduced, commonly referred to as the shipping clause. The Commission’s rationale is based on three objectives: to increase the effectiveness of the instruments, to reduce the threat of retaliation from third country, and to increase transparency and predictability.

 I voted in favour of this proposal because the fraud and related illegal activities affecting the Union’s financial interests pose a serious problem to the detriment of the Union budget and thereby the taxpayers. For this reason we call to the European institutions to ensure that public money is devoted to structural growth, fiscal consolidation and jobs. There are differences among the Member States legal and sanctioning systems. This fragmented legal framework creates incentives, for the potential perpetrators, to move across the European territory to the most favourable judicial system. I believe we should respond with a unique voice to fraud and any other activities affecting the financial interests of the Union through deterrent measures. I consider this proposal for a directive on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interest also as an important step in the field of EU Criminal Law. This area has been significantly enhanced since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and should be used to the fullest extent. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this proposal because with this text we lay down provisions for the European Parliament to set up temporary committees of inquiry to investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Community law. I consider it is of fundamental importance to guarantee inquiry committees the possibility to request documents, to summon witnesses, to hear officials and other servants of the Union or of Member States and to request experts’ reports when necessary to carry out investigations. However I believe that Parliament should lead the way in ensuring that the inquiry committee remains independent. For this reason it should closely monitor the impartiality and discretion of the examination and assure transparency and accountability throughout the investigation process. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted for this report as the development of relations between European Parliament and national parliaments is of essential importance. The resulting exchange of information is enabling the national parliaments to provide the EP with sounder evaluations and the EP to adopt decisions on the basis of broad consensus. This is ought to make it easier for European provisions to be transposed into national law rapidly and effectively by the national parliaments. Another important aspect is the so-called 'European mainstreaming' within the national parliaments, where European awareness can be achieved much more effectively by the national parliaments than by the European Parliament.

 I support this report in order to further elevate EU-Japan relations through the timely conclusion of the negotiations of a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement. Japan has been an EU strategic partner since 2003 and since has already cooperated in a number of fields such as customs cooperation and legal assistance in criminal matters, science and technology, internet security, academic and research cooperation, the peaceful use of nuclear energy, business community contacts and the promotion of people-to-people links. Moreover, the further enhancement of EU-Japan relations will aim at providing a long-standing framework for a closer relationship contributing considerably to the deepening of political, economic and cultural relations with tangible results for the citizens of both regions.

 I voted for this report as I believe we need to support the financial institutions of the Republic of Tunisia in order to sustain the population and strengthen their path onto democracy. Thanks to the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, Tunisia was the first Mediterranean country to enter in a free trade area with the Union. Unfortunately Tunisia's economy has been significantly affected by the "Arab Spring" and by the regional unrest that followed, particularly in neighbouring Libya. These events and the weak global economic environment, in particular the recession in the euro area, Tunisia's main trading and financial partner, has had a very negative impact on the Tunisian economy, leading to a slowdown in growth and generating large external and budgetary financing gaps. For this reason I think that the Union's macro-financial assistance will aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external financing situation of the country thereby supporting its economic and social development.

 I voted for this report because I believe that the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme will accelerate the clinical development of effective, safe and affordable medical interventions for poverty-related diseases. There is a need to develop partnership with developing countries such as sub-Saharan Africa to tackle the negative impacts of poverty-related diseases which affect 1 billion people. Moreover, given the humanitarian aspect of this important sector we need to make sure that the best possible outcomes are achieved. Therefore, coordinating closely with other organisations from public, private and voluntary sectors is also vital, not only to maximise the investments of Members States but also to minimise overlap and duplication.

With this text we reiterate our full support for the International Criminal Court and we urge the EU to continue fighting against the use of the death penalty and to strongly support the moratorium as a step towards abolition. As for bilateral relations between EU and UN, it is essential to support actively a comprehensive reform of the United Nations system, and especially its Security Council, in order to strengthen its legitimacy, regional representation, accountability and effectiveness.

 I voted for this report because the European Consensus on Development remains the most comprehensive basis for Union development cooperation. It sets out common objectives and principles for development and underlines the Union’s commitment to poverty eradication. The European Year for Development will also act as a catalyst for EU support by raising awareness through political public debate, building momentum and exchanging best practices between Member States, local and regional authorities and civil society. It will help foster a sense of joint responsibility and solidarity among Europeans and people in developing countries. Combating global poverty is not only a moral obligation, it will also help to build a more stable and peaceful world, reflecting the interdependence of richer and poorer countries. The Lisbon Treaty has firmly anchored development policy within Union external action in support of the Union’s interest in a stable and prosperous and more equitable world. Development policy also helps address other global challenges and contributes to the EU-2020 Strategy. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I believe that in a global context where the number of retaliatory trade actions is increasing the mere existence of this recommended regulation will present a credible threat and will hopefully dissuade our trading partners from not respecting the rules of the game.

 I voted in favour of this resolution because I strongly believe that both internal political developments in Iran and the interim agreement on the nuclear issue have opened a great window of opportunity both for reforms within Iran and an improvement in its external relations with the EU. Most of all I am particularly satisfied because with this text we call for a more independent EU policy towards Iran. We also urged the Council to start a discussion on the relief of the nuclear-related sanctions. In addition I believe that Iran should be involved in the discussions for finding a solution for the Syrian crisis. On the other hand, I consider it important that, besides the nuclear deal, various topics including human rights and regional security need to be discussed between the EU and Iran. In this resolution we express our grave concern regarding the human rights situation in Iran, in particular the widespread allegations of torture, unfair trials and the high number of executions in 2013 and 2014.

 I am strongly against this resolution because its text consists of a series of attacks on Russia with the tone and language of the Cold War. This will only help to inflame the debate and to destabilise Ukraine. The resolution ignores the fact that half of Ukraine is pro-Russian and Russian-speaking and has no plans whatsoever to join the EU or NATO. To oblige Ukraine to make a choice between the EU and Russia means splitting the country and encouraging its dissolution. I believe that threatening Russia with sanctions, without leaving space for political dialogue and negotiation, is completely irresponsible. In addition I am astonished by the reckless decision of the Commission and the European Council to allocate a huge sum, EUR[nbsp ]11 billion, just for a couple of years, in favour of Ukraine. We do not have such money. And we cannot trust to have it back from a corrupt country on the brink of bankruptcy. We did not ask for any prior commitment by the Ukrainian Government in the fight against corruption, nor did we explore alternative financial aid possibilities, such as recovery of the assets of the Ukrainian oligarchs that are hidden in European banks.

 I am in favour of this report because it acknowledges that the revelations concerning the US NSA surveillance programme since June 2013 have profoundly shaken the trust between the two transatlantic partners and the trust between citizens and their governments. These revelations also undermined the confidence of members of the public in the functioning of democratic institutions on both sides of the Atlantic. With this text we strongly condemn the vast and systemic blanket collection of the personal data of random people, often including intimate personal information. It is important to make it clear that the systems for indiscriminate mass surveillance by intelligence services constitute a serious interference with the fundamental rights of citizens. Privacy is not a right that is a luxury, but is the foundation stone of a free and democratic society. In addition mass surveillance has potentially severe effects on freedom of the press, thought and speech and on freedom of assembly. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I support this resolution because I agree that Turkey is a strategic partner for the EU and an important regional player for its wider neighbourhood. I am in favour of full EU membership for Turkey. For these reasons I am deeply concerned at the recent developments in Turkey with regard to allegations of high-level corruption. With this text we strongly regret the removal of the prosecutors and police officers in charge of the original investigations, as this goes against the fundamental principle of an independent judiciary and deeply affects the prospects for credible investigations. I consider regrettable the serious breakdown of trust between the government, the judiciary, the police and the media. Therefore, it is fundamental to urge Turkeyʼs Government to show full commitment to democratic principles and to refrain from any further interference in the investigation and prosecution of corruption.

 Mr President, I believe the discussion today is an opportunity to call on the UN Human Rights Council to follow up the implementation of the UN Secretary-General’s recommendations on the protection of human rights in Western Sahara. Morocco, as a new member of UNHRC, should acknowledge the right of the Sahrawi people to self-determination in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions and should put an end to the ongoing violation of human rights of the Sahrawi people. Also, I believe that Morocco should urgently release all Sahrawi political prisoners. For these reasons, I would like to ask all colleagues to vote in favour of all the amendments on Western Sahara proposed by the political groups. We cannot turn a blind eye to this unlawful occupation, and we cannot ignore the fact that one of our neighbouring countries is perpetrating the last case of colonial oppression in Africa.

 I support this report because this new directive will improve the legislation which prevents the conversion of the proceeds of criminal activity into legitimate funds via the financial system. To be able to do that, the operations of business registers have to be improved. Indeed, the identification of the beneficial owner of the business or the business transaction is crucial in preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. We must bear in mind that massive flows of illicit money damage the stability and reputation of the financial sector and threaten the single market as well as international development. I am persuaded that, in addition to the criminal law approach, a preventive effort via the financial system can produce results. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Mr. President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I share the view that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is an influential political, economic and religious actor in the Middle East and the Islamic world. It is also the world’s leading oil producer and an important partner for the EU. Nonetheless, we cannot ignore that KSA is the only country in the world in which women are not allowed to drive. With this text we call on the KSA authorities to eliminate all restrictions on women’s human rights, freedom of movement, health, education, marriage, employment opportunities, legal personality and representation in judicial processes, and all forms of discrimination against women in family law and in private and public life. Also, we ask Saudi Arabia to define a minimum age for marriage and take steps to ban child marriage in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which were both ratified by KSA.

Iraq has seen about 1[nbsp ]500 civilian deaths from violence since the beginning of this year.

 Mr President, I have two questions for Commissioner Füle. First, I appreciated the most recent position taken by Baroness Ashton on the Ukraine-EU-Russia relationship. She says that the crisis in Ukraine was wrongly perceived as a confrontation between East and West, when the reality is that of a convergence and a synergy. Baroness Ashton accepts the concept of a Eurasian integration process where Russia and the EU cooperate in the creation of a common area of trade, stability and peace. My question is: why insist on keeping two systems of customs union alive, instead of creating just one free-trade zone?  Secondly, the Ukrainian Parliament is proposing to have in a new government three ministers who belong to the Svoboda Party, which is a neo-Nazi, anti-Semitic entity. What do you intend to do to maintain coherence with your past position on the inclusion of the Haider party in the Government of Austria? Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Mr[nbsp ]President, I am listening here to a long list of horror stories about Iraq. A few of my colleagues have mentioned what was a major origin of the horror, namely the war – one of the most stupid, expensive and useless wars of the last decades, waged in the name of exporting democracy and defending us from threats that did not exist. So, since this is a time when many of us would like Europe to play an increasing role in the world, with more intervention, accomplishing more and better things on all fronts, I would simply like to remind my colleagues that once the cameras have gone, once the spotlight has shifted, the problem may be that democracy is not there in the way that you expected. You have to contribute to rebuilding a country which is very hard to rebuild, and you have to address all the problems that are now apparent. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 This Parliament is taking a very important position on the issue of the use of armed drones. The resolution agreed upon is the first step towards the total prohibition of the use of this horrible weapon.  If there is one reason to forbid forever the use of drones it is simply the fact that they are a new weapon. We received a Nobel Prize for peace, and one of the main points is this: stop inventing new weapons; stop using technology and science to invent new weapons. So I am really surprised by all these limitations that are put by some colleagues on this issue. International law prohibits arbitrary killings, and this should be the main reason, in addition to what I have already said, for having a firm position against this new weapon. So I hope that this resolution will be the first step towards a total ban on this weapon. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted for this report because the proposal for a new legislation on confiscation of the proceeds of crime was strongly advocated by this Parliament. Thanks to this directive, Member States will have common rules for the freezing and confiscation of criminal assets through direct confiscation, value confiscation, extended confiscation, non-conviction-based confiscation and third-party confiscation. This will harmonise the EUʼs freezing and confiscation regimes, facilitating mutual trust and effective cross-border cooperation. Most of all, it will also constitute a step towards strengthening the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders which is an important aspect of the fight against cross-border serious and organised crime in the EU.

 I fully support the creation of this regulation because, as the economic crisis is exacerbating poverty and social exclusion across the Union, we must take tangible actions to alleviate the needs of the most deprived persons. In fact the aim of this Fund is to establish a new, broader instrument, able to relieve the most severe forms of poverty such as food and material impoverishment. Although the budget for the Fund is still far from being enough, nonetheless it does have the potential to play an important role ensuring the predictability of the support, which is essential for the charities and civil society organisations. I also believe that it is important to stress that this kind of fund should remain a complement to national policies, as the obligation to combat and eliminate poverty remains the responsibility of Member States.

 I voted against this resolution because I could not agree less with its approach to the Ukrainian crisis. Ukraine is not an EU protectorate. It is a sovereign country with a freely elected parliament. We should stop telling them what kind of government they should have, what kind of constitution they should adopt, and when and how to hold elections. It is not the European Union’s business to ‘liberate’ Ukraine or to take sides in its political process. It is ridiculous to ask Russia to stop retaliatory measures against Ukraine and, at the same time, to threaten EU sanctions if it does not follow our diktat. I believe that the latest events in Ukraine show, instead, the need for a thorough review of the Eastern Partnership project. This policy should be redesigned with a view of including Russia in its scope and not antagonising a country which is not an enemy – because Russia is part of Europe and should be treated accordingly.

 I support this resolution as I believe that Europe should focus its attention on the quality of institution-building. European efforts should all be aimed at strengthening the rule of law and bolstering institutions and economic reform in Egypt. Asset recovery is of primary importance in this respect. The restitution of frozen assets is – over and above its economic significance – a strong message against the impunity for corruption and money laundering that has been enjoyed so far by unscrupulous political leaders.

 I voted for this resolution because it calls once again on the Council to set a date for the start of EU accession talks with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

 I voted for this resolution, which endorses the Commission’s communication entitled ‘Towards the elimination of female genital mutilation’. With this tool, EU funding to prevent female genital mutilation (FGM) and to improve support for victims will be increased. FGM is a brutal practice which does not occur only in third countries but also affects women and girls living in the EU and constitutes a clear violation of fundamental rights. For this reason we call, via with this resolution, on the Member States to use all existing mechanisms to pursue, prosecute and punish any resident who has committed the crime of FGM, even if the offence was committed outside the borders of the Member State concerned.

 I strongly support the ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty by the Member States because it establishes the first global regulation for trade in conventional weapons and, to some extent, in ammunition and parts and components. The ATT will prevent the illegal trade of weapons, international terrorism and organised crime and will limit serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. The strongest point of the ATT is that state parties are obliged to establish a national control system for these transfers and to evaluate, before authorising any transfer, the risk that these arms might impair peace and security or could be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law or human rights. It is also important that not only trade of arms but other acts such as rental, licensing, grants and transfers of relevant technology also fall under the prohibition. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I believe that in the last few days Ukraine has shown up a need for a deep review of our Eastern partnership project. The major flaw of our Eastern policies is their anti-Russian, Cold War profile. This policy should be redesigned with a view to including a rational approach and not antagonising a country which is not an enemy; because Russia is part of Europe and should be treated accordingly.  Another major blunder is our excessive interference in Ukrainian political affairs. Ukraine is not an EU protectorate; it is a sovereign country with a freely-elected parliament. We should stop telling them what kind of government they should have, what kind of constitution they should adopt and when and how to have a political election.   It is not the European Union’s business to liberate Ukraine and to take sides in its political process. It is ridiculous to ask Russia to stop retaliatory measures against Ukraine yet at the same time threaten EU sanctions if Ukraine does not follow our agenda. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, it is time for the EU to stop taking sides and positions at every political turn in the Egyptian transition. Europe should focus its attention on the quality of institution-building. Therefore, our efforts should all be directed at strengthening the rule of law and bolstering institutions and economic reform. To that end, I attach primary importance to major issues such as asset recovery. The restitution of frozen assets is – over and above its economic significance – a strong signal against the impunity for corruption and money laundering that has so far been enjoyed by unscrupulous political leaders in Egypt and elsewhere. I would reiterate that the only way to build a sustainable democracy in Egypt is by following the path of national reconciliation and inclusive political process. Any ban, exclusion or repression directed against any political force or actor in Egypt repeats past mistakes and leads only to increased radicalism. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this proposal, which will significantly reduce bureaucracy and remove yet another obstacle to a truly transnational and borderless European Union. The regulation aims to fulfil the very important role of making formalities easier for citizens who move across borders. A large number of EU citizens live in a Member State other than their own, and this number is steadily increasing. However, administrative formalities across borders are generally considerably more complicated than within each Member State. For this reason this text aims to simplify the cross-border recognition of public documents and to reduce the number of documents needing certified translation. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

Since January 2011, the European Parliament has made this request ten times in various resolutions, asking the European Commission to produce a roadmap against homophobia.

I fully support this motion because wildlife crime constitutes a threat to the welfare of the animals and to the conservation of the animal and plant species concerned, putting the local ecosystems as a whole at risk. Furthermore, illicit wildlife trafficking often involves transnational organised criminal networks and is used as a source of revenue with an annual turnover of at least USD 19 billion. This is why tackling wildlife crime requires a coordinated global response at the highest political level and between enforcement agencies. Moreover, an EU plan of action against wildlife crime and trafficking needs to be established and effective judicial systems developed in order to better combat this crime at local, national and regional level.

I voted for this resolution because, although equality should be a fundamental principle in the European Union, there is still discrimination concerning the access to the healthcare system. As a matter of fact, the healthcare system is in many cases restricted as a result of financial constraints. I do believe that the eHealth system could play a key role in reducing these inequalities. Nonetheless, Member States must invest in affordable, high-quality health systems. Moreover, some patients are obliged to undergo medical treatment outside their country of residence and this is not acceptable. Also, I would like to highlight that every citizen should have the opportunity to use IT tools or the skills needed to take advantage of eHealth services and we have the duty to make this possible.

I voted for this report because it is necessary to regain consumer confidence in the single market for foods, as the agri-food sector is one of the biggest sectors in the EU economy, providing 48 million jobs and worth EUR 715 billion annually. I would like to point out the importance of inspections and the effectiveness of unannounced inspections, which should be made regular and mandatory by Member States.

I voted for this resolution because I believe that labour inspection plays an important role in protecting employees’ rights. It is the responsibility of companies to ensure legal working conditions but unfortunately they do not always do so. Irregularly employed workers suffer from consequences such as the fear of having an accident or being caught, which in turn affects the productivity of companies and the economy as a whole. We need to win the fight against unsafe working environments. Also, in this time of economic crisis, undeclared work has negative consequences for Member States’ economies and creates social and financial insecurity. For all these reasons, all Member States must commit to taking the necessary measures on this issue at national level. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

It is vital that more effective coordination is achieved by the EU and its Member States through joint programming, including domestic division of labour in order to avoid overlapping of actions and high transaction costs.

In addition, I believe that a new EGF criterion with the wider eligibility scope signifies a more precise answer to market needs. Indeed the new EGF will now include: small and medium enterprises, the self-employed, workers with non-standard employment contracts and farmers.

Also, having emerged from a war and being located in an unstable region, it is in danger of failing if the international community and local stakeholders fail to cooperate in developing a joint strategy to turn it into a democratic and inclusive state.

Madam President, as a shadow rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Instrument, I would like to congratulate Mr Kukan for the huge effort and the result obtained during these difficult negotiations. With this instrument we finally have a good tool for implementation of the neighbourhood policy, especially with regard to the principle of a partnership of societies. More specifically, I hope this instrument will provide a good base for rebuilding our Eastern Partnership. The previous debate demonstrated what the major flaw of our eastern policy was: its anti-Russian profile and its cold-war and clash of civilisations inspiration.

Madam President, Morocco invaded and militarily occupied the territory of Western Sahara and has no legal title to dispose of Western Sahara’s natural resources. The EU should not be an accomplice to a colonial robbery.  If Morocco and the Commission had intended to take into account the reason behind Parliament’s rejection of the fisheries agreement, they would have included in it the need for Morocco to give to the Sahrawi people the revenues coming from the exploitation of their waters. Otherwise they could have excluded from the agreement the waters of Western Sahara, following the example of the US Congress and US Government, which do not include Western Sahara in any economic agreement with Morocco. None of that has happened. The text of the agreement contains only a generic and hypocritical reporting obligation for the Kingdom of Morocco on respect for human rights in international law. Morocco does not have the slightest credibility in this regard as it continues to practice torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, along with targeted assassination and political persecution in the occupied territories.

For this reason I believe that this is the right context to discuss about the on-going violation of human rights in Western Sahara. As neighbours and partner countries, we must urge Morocco to continue negotiations for a peaceful and long-lasting solution of the Western Sahara conflict. The Sahrawi people have the right to self-determination through a democratic referendum, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.

We are not playing a repetition of the Great Game of two centuries ago, because Russia is also part of Europe and is not a threat to us. Likewise, we should not be perceived as a threat to them.

I support this resolution because it states that a lasting solution to the current crisis in Syria can only be achieved through a Syrian-led inclusive political process with the backing of the international community. For this reason it is fundamental to support the efforts of the European Union and of UN-Arab League Joint Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi to achieve progress in the Geneva II process and at the UN Security Council. With this text we also urge the EU and the Member States to live up to their humanitarian responsibilities and to increase their assistance to Syrian refugees. I personally strongly believe that any military intervention – with or without UN authorisation – in Syria is bound to have grave and highly unpredictable consequences and that a worsening of the situation on the ground cannot be excluded.

I support this text because after the military coup of July Egypt is in a very unstable and worrying situation. The political tensions continue to provoke violent clashes, which have resulted in more than 1 000 deaths and many more injured. I am firmly convinced that any exclusion or prosecution against a democratic political force or actor in Egypt can only lead to increased radicalism. We need to condemn in the stronger possible terms the disproportionate use of force against the protesters without penalising the Egyptian population while suspending aid to the country. In addition, with this resolution we urge the EU to proceed without delay to establish an EU mechanism providing legal and technical assistance to Arab Spring countries in the process of asset recovery. This instrument, already supported by this Parliament on several occasions, was delayed because of the turmoil in Egypt. It is vital to bear in mind that asset recovery has a highly symbolic value and may contribute largely to restoring accountability, creating stability and building solid institutions in the spirit of democracy and the rule of law in the partner countries concerned.

For this reason with this text we urge the Belarusian authorities to respect human rights and work towards a democratic transition in order to end the country’s self-imposed isolation from the rest of Europe. I also think that the EU should carry out an in-depth evaluation of the EUʼs current restrictive measures against Belarusian officials and entities, which have so far proved to be ineffective in bringing democratic change in Belarus.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to have the fact that I was absent during the last part-session recorded in the minutes. The United Nations had invited me, in my capacity as Chair of the Special Committee on Organised Crime, Corruption and Money Laundering, to work on the UN report on transnational organised crime cases. I shall forward to you as soon as possible the invitation from the United Nations, the report and the minutes. I would therefore ask for everything to be recorded in the minutes at the earliest opportunity. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself for the umpteenth time – this is the third year of my term of office – and time and again we deal with the same problems as if it were the first time. And this year, as in every other year, we are once again witnessing a mass slaughter. The Mediterranean has now become an open mass grave. It is also the tomb of civilisation and, above all, the tomb of the hopes of thousands of people fleeing – men, women and children as has just been mentioned – fleeing from their countries and fleeing, above all, from civil and religious persecution. Europe has major responsibilities because it has negotiated with murderers like Gaddafi, who have used these poor martyrs – and Gaddafi did so precisely to raise the stakes and at the very moment Europe was in negotiations with Libya. Every time, we find ourselves debating the issue as if it were the first time. What I want to know is what are we planning to do about it? What actual responses are we going to give our citizens? Yet again, this is another tragedy and, as Mr Moraes quite rightly has pointed out, the Italian Government may have changed, but we still have to give answers. Sonia Alfano,

Mr President, I would like to offer you my best wishes on your new position. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy that today, we are debating in plenary a resolution that stems from the many petitions that reach the European Parliament, and that refers specifically to the question of waste. These petitions demonstrate the concern of European citizens about the harm done to the environment, human health and the economy by waste management practices prevalent in various areas in Europe. Even though I agree with the overall structure of the resolution, I am rather dissatisfied with how some of its passages address the issue of incinerators. At times, it seems that thanks to technology, any problem related to public health and the environment has been completely overcome. Until last year, right here, we were hearing the same words about nuclear power plants. Today, however, in this same Chamber, it is difficult to find anyone willing to defend the nuclear industry. Is it possible that politics is simply unable to take a long-term view? Do we really have to wait for more epidemiological studies confirming the increased cancer rates already found throughout populations living near incinerators? This is not the NIMBY syndrome, but simply the citizens defending their right to health. There are alternatives that are virtuous and create employment. We must implement the spirit of the Waste Management Directive strictly, with a waste cycle based on the concepts of reduction, reuse and recycling. Landfill and incineration are residual, hierarchically inferior options, resorted to only after everything else possible has been done. If there was a political will to that effect, incinerators would be a nice memory. I think that Parliament should take a more advanced stance and better protect its citizens in this area. I hope that the European Commission will propose stricter criteria and procedures for building incinerators and opening landfill sites, and encourage serious ‘zero waste’ policies in all Member States.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe this is the umpteenth time that Mr Borghezio has referred to Padania. I would like to know if this is an imaginary place like Duckburg or some other hypothetical town from a fairy tale. I ask because he referred to Naples and Campania, a region that I would remind you is controlled by a local centre-right government in Italy. So I wanted to understand where Padania is and if, by any chance, he is referring to Italy, the place where he was elected. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to ask Mr Borghezio, in view of the fact he supported the government of Mr Orbán, denying the evidence that the presidents of the other groups have already presented, the reform of the judiciary and not of the judicial system, why I heard Mr Borghezio say ‘Come and visit us in Padania’, because, as far as I am aware, Mr Borghezio was elected in Italy and Padania is not one of the 27 Member States.

 Madam President, I would like to ask Parliament to express its solidarity for the people of my region, Sicily, which in recent weeks has been hit by terrible floods. Thousands of people in the province of Messina have still been unable to return home, and three people have died, including a boy of 11. This is mainly the fault of the bad habit of failing to manage the land properly. Sonia Alfano,

Madam President, I first of all wish to thank Mr Cashman for his excellent work and, in particular, for his great patience. As we all know, democracy is based on making legislative work public, on the transparency of the decision-making process, and on the people’s right to make informed decisions. For this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Treaties have proclaimed the fundamental right to access documents and information. This right must be guaranteed for all citizens, from local to international levels, in order to ensure that the institutions carry out the task for which they were created: to work on the citizens’ behalf in a transparent manner. Transparency is essential to prevent and combat corruption and the infiltration of the institutions at all levels by organised crime and powerful interests. I am particularly satisfied because the report on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding access to documents has accepted some important amendments which I submitted, in particular, those on financial and budgetary transparency, on the beneficiaries of European funds, on how EU money is spent, and on how European policies are implemented, all of which can be accessed via a database on the Internet. Other amendments submitted by me are included in the report, establishing rules for accessing information in electronic format contained in European databases, rules to limit exceptions to document access, especially when they refer to European legislative procedures, and rules for overriding the power of Member States to veto the publication of documents. The ALDE Group will therefore vote in favour of the Cashman report and I hope that the majority of this Parliament will support it, despite the opposition of some Members who have induced their groups to follow the interests of economic bureaucratic and industrial lobbies or those entrenched in the defence of the class and its secrets. The ALDE Group moreover asks the European Commission and Council to accept the proposals of the European Parliament and, under the Danish Presidency, to launch negotiations so as to finally take the necessary steps forward to assert the fundamental and democratic right of citizens to acquire the knowledge they require in order to make their decisions. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, there are many facts that unfortunately lead us to the conclusion that human rights and freedom of expression are constantly being violated in Kazakhstan. I can give an actual example, to back up my statement. On 26 October 2011, cameraman Asan Amilov and journalist Orken Bizenov were the victims of an armed attack in the district of Mańğystau. Their newspaper Stan.kz
 first went into print in March 2007 with a network of correspondents throughout Central Asia, providing prompt and professional information about what was going on in Kazakhstan and its neighbouring countries, and winning a positive response from the people. It is surely no coincidence that the attackers took the journalists’ laptop, which contained important video footage from the strikes of the oil company workers in Mańğystau. This is just the latest of many examples of intimidation which all too often involve the public authorities. I call on the Commission to take a decisive stance in condemning such practices and to take their attempts to violate the freedom of the press into due consideration in the EU’s negotiations with these countries. Finally, I support the proposal to organise a round table at EU level between the Kazakhstan authorities, the workers’ representatives in the province of Mańğystau and the oil company representatives, in order to find a solution to the serious situation that emerged with the strikes of May 2011. Sonia Alfano,

 Mr President, I would like to request a roll-call vote for the final vote on the report on organised crime. My thanks go to all the shadow rapporteurs: Mr Iacolino, Mr Crocetta, Mr Albrecht, Mr de Jong, Mr Kirkhope, Ms Borsellino and Ms Costa, since they all made a decisive contribution to the drafting of the final report. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, relatives of mafia victims, judges and witnesses are here in the gallery. If Parliament adopts this report today, we will be giving due recognition, and be able to dedicate this work, to all the innocent victims of organised crime and mafias. Their memory, the memory of those who paid with their lives for choosing not to give in to the foulness of moral compromise must guide us, and it compels us to send strong, unequivocal signals, such as the one I hope we are about to send to Europe’s citizens today. (Applause) Sonia Alfano,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with the work that has been achieved with the political groups, particularly the shadow rapporteurs: Mr Iacolino for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Mr Crocetta for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Mr Albrecht for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mr Kirkhope for the European Conservatives and Reformists and Mr de Jong for the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. Their noteworthy contributions were decisive in arriving at an advanced and ambitious final draft. Organised crime and mafias are one of the main threats to the security and freedoms of the people of Europe. For the first time in European political history, an official document is making explicit reference to mafias and to the need for specific, transnational measures to fight them. It is crucial to focus on organised crime and mafias because, as the Europol reports show, organised criminal groups are cropping up everywhere; they are taking root in the Member States and have heavily infiltrated the economy, finance, politics and all levels of government. With this report, Parliament is proposing a concrete political line of attack, a serious, coordinated intervention and a treatment that is at last a match for the seriousness of the situation. This treatment is based on the intelligence gathering and analyses of those who fight organised crime every day. I take this opportunity to thank the judges, police representatives, researchers and witnesses who have contributed their precious experience to drawing up the definitive solutions proposed here. In a spirit of service and self-denial, they represent their Member States on a daily basis in an unequal fight against criminal organisations. What drives criminal organisations is profit. That is why in the report, we have prioritised attacking assets that can be directly or indirectly traced back to organised crime. We are therefore looking forward with extreme interest to the proposal for a directive that the Commission is due to submit in the coming months on a European body of law to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate criminal assets. I am therefore very happy to see Commissioner Reding here, and I would like to put Parliament’s specific political wishes to her. We ask for European rules to allow so-called extended confiscation and effective preventive measures, such as non conviction-based confiscation; we ask for rules to allow the targeting of assets held by front persons; and, above all, we call for rules to use confiscated assets for social purposes, so as to turn it into a cultural operation with the full involvement of civil society, without which merely fighting organised crime would be a wasted effort. To give an idea of the importance of the document to be voted on tomorrow, I will give a list of the measures requested at European level: harmonisation of legislation on organised crime; rules for greater victim protection; extension of the offence of mafia association to all Member States; greater coordination and cooperation between Europol, Eurojust and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and with national authorities; improved judicial cooperation and full implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions; rules on transparency and prevention to stop public funds ending up in the hands of organised criminals; rules to counter financial crime and money laundering; and rules to prevent people convicted of offences connected with organised crime from standing in European elections. We are absolutely sure about one thing, Commissioner: these demands, which we vigorously called for in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and which we are about to adopt here, will not remain mere words. We will use every means at our disposal to put them into practice, in line with the Treaties in force which, fully in accordance with the democratic nature of the European Union, assign to the national parliaments and the European Parliament the fundamental role of guiding and assessing policy in the area of freedom, security and justice so as to protect the interests of the people of Europe. That is why we hope the Commission will immediately acknowledge the political importance and significance of this House’s position. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I would like to dedicate this work – this first step that Parliament is about to take – to all the innocent victims of organised crime and mafias. Their memory, the memory of those who paid with their lives for choosing not to give in to the foulness of moral compromise, must guide us, and it compels us to send out strong, unequivocal signals, such as the one I hope we will send to the people of Europe tomorrow.

 Mr President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, the first meeting of the EU-Tunisia task force, which is charged with support for the transition to democracy and economic recovery, took place today. This year, Europe’s financial commitment was doubled, and obviously I welcome this, because Tunisia, with which we have a privileged partnership, has also agreed to accept sub-Saharan refugees fleeing from the war in Libya. The European Union, which has often reaffirmed its commitment to the refugees, must without fail support and aid Tunisia to manage these migration flows while fully respecting human rights. Norway, although not part of the European Union, has agreed to accommodate more than 300 refugees, while EU Member States have agreed to accommodate fewer than 400 refugees in total. I consider this to be a deplorable and shameful attitude, a real insult to the principle of solidarity that should underpin the European Union’s Mediterranean policy. I should remind you, what is more, that these refugees are currently confined in camps in intolerable conditions. This morning in this very Chamber the European Parliament approved by a large majority an allocation of EUR 43.9 million for managing the migrant and refugee flows arising from repression by authoritarian regimes and movements linked to the Arab Spring. These additional funds will be used to assist the Member States most affected by these flows and to reinforce marine patrols by Frontex. Let us reaffirm our assent to a Europe committed as much to the promotion of human rights as to the management of migration flows, and let us reject the idea of a fortress Europe that is xenophobic and closed. Today, the European Union is paying the price of its previous support for the dictatorial regimes of North Africa. Our former friends Gaddafi and Ben Ali have fallen or are falling and their people are fleeing repression. I should like to know what stage the joint EU resettlement programme, currently blocked in the Council, has reached. I am asking you, Commissioner, whom I know to be extremely sensitive and pro-active, how, in the current situation, can the European Union make a concrete commitment with regard to this humanitarian emergency? In conclusion, I am taking the opportunity of asking the Commission whether it is aware of what is happening in Palermo, where the Italian authorities are forcing 250 migrants to remain aboard a ship, without any provision authorising their detention, and denying them their right to freedom and to communicate with the outside world. Thanks to numerous reports presented to the Public Prosecutor’s Office at Palermo by many organisations in Palermo and Sicily fighting for human rights, the Palermo Public Prosecutor has just opened an investigation. This event follows some extremely serious facts that took place at Lampedusa last week, where the situation is out of control and where the safety of both the local population and that of the migrants themselves is at risk.

 Mr President, I would like to say something about the botched attempt at evacuation that took place in Parliament in Brussels last week. I think what happened was totally against the rules, because nobody came round to our rooms to warn us and tell us that we had to leave and evacuate the building, and then outside Parliament we were all free to do whatever we liked. I would therefore like to know how much this Parliament spends every year on evacuation procedures and Parliament’s safety. I would expect an institution of this kind to have somewhat stricter rules, at the very least. Sonia Alfano,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have studied the anti-corruption package presented by the Commission in June extremely carefully, and I have to say that I am impressed with the content of the package. It is a good starting point, and all the European institutions, especially the European Parliament, must strive to achieve real, measurable results quickly. Today corruption is the main route by which organised crime penetrates the legal economy and the public sector. Corruption creates criminal systems, and dangerous connections between entrepreneurs, politicians and public officials. It is estimated that the cost of corruption in Europe is some EUR 120 billion. I have to say that this is a conservative estimate given that in my country, Italy, alone, corruption accounts for EUR 60 billion a year, practically the amount of a financial package that at the moment would save my country from default. With regard to the June communication and the proposals presented, I would like to ask the Commission what measures it intends to propose to improve the fight against corruption in the private sector. Can it give us some details about how it intends to improve financial investigations? What measures does it intend to propose to combat political corruption, and what point have the assessments of the review of the tender directive to combat conflicts of interest and of the draft directive for regulating concessions reached? As Mr Albrecht has already said, this Parliament and these institutions have already been working on equally important problems, such as terrorism, for some time. This directive, the directive on corruption, gives ample space and visibility, and above all it gives us the chance to consider and to understand once and for all the extent to which organised crime is firmly entrenched in all 27 Member States. In any case, Commissioner, this is what you said exactly one year ago, and these answers are crucial for us, especially considering the fact that in a month’s time we will be voting on the report on organised crime in Europe, for which I am the rapporteur. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment of the Frontex Regulation, on which we are voting today, is designed to strengthen the European Agency, endowing it with greater operational capabilities and strengthening the enforcement of the fundamental rights of refugees and asylum seekers but, above all, the ban on refoulement. The creation of a fundamental rights officer role within the Frontex Management Board and the requirement for Member States to show solidarity with each other are steps in that direction. The reform of Frontex must enable us to tackle the real migration-related emergencies in Europe. Only today, the Financial Times
 reports that approximately 85% of the 104 000 migrants who entered the EU illegally in 2010 arrived via Greece, and not via Italy or Malta, and unfortunately the same will be true in 2012. Only if Frontex fully respects migrants’ human rights and helps to prevent the huge number of deaths in the Mediterranean, which has now become a burial ground in which the lives and hopes of people fleeing poverty, oppression and desperation are extinguished, will we be able to say that we are on the right track. This must be Frontex’s goal, and the European Parliament will have to monitor the progress made in this regard. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Ms Hautala and Ms Sargentini on their excellent work. Through the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, transparency has become a basic right of European citizens. We are on the right track, but unfortunately, even in this day and age, there is great resistance when we talk about transparency. In my opinion, there is no middle way: anyone against full transparency obviously has something to hide and would prefer for decisions to be taken out of sight from citizens and the press. The Commission refuses to accept the proposals to revise the regulation on access to documents, which were put forward by Parliament in the report by Mr Cashman and provide for greater transparency. The Council, meanwhile, systematically refuses to make the identities of Member States known during discussions and votes in their meetings. The legal services of the Commission, the Council and Parliament continue to use excuses to hide their legal opinions, despite the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the Turco
 case. Even in Parliament, there is substantial resistance to guaranteeing access to information for citizens, particularly with regard to the activities of Members and the expenditure of this House and its Members. The so-called Galvin report has finally been published, though unfortunately, the names are missing from it. I believe that transparency is one of democracy’s basic tools for combating abuses of power, waste and corruption, and for forging closer relationships between citizens and institutions. In my view, the report by Ms Hautala and Ms Sargentini works along these same lines and hence it deserves the maximum support. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I shall be voting in favour of this report. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday 60 000 Italians demonstrated in Val di Susa against the absurd project to build the Lyon-Turin high-speed rail link (‘TAV’). As an MEP I condemn all forms of violence, whether the violence of the rioters who created disorder yesterday or the violence of the Italian members of parliament and ministers who today tried to liken the peaceful ‘No TAV’ people to the ‘Black Bloc’. Everyone knows that the high-speed rail link in Val di Susa will never be built. Can an area be militarised for 20 years? This is the result of failing to listen to the people and should be a lesson to the EU. Works are done with the citizens for the citizens, not for party political committees on the left and right. The deadlines imposed by the Commission for the provision of the European contribution, amounting to EUR 662 million, have expired. Mr Kallas should decide to withdraw the funding immediately. With these extensions, Italy is enjoying privileges not granted to other Member States. Therefore, I urge the Committee on Petitions to send a delegation to Val di Susa as soon as possible to establish what is happening and listen to local people. The European Parliament should not abandon these citizens and their arguments. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is the first instrument implemented in the European Union that puts into practice the principle of mutual recognition of criminal judgments. That instrument is fundamentally important now and should remain so, especially for fighting mafia groups and organised crime. In the report on organised crime, for which I am the rapporteur in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we are proposing a series of considerations and requests concerning the European Arrest Warrant. One of the main requests is for the EAW to be strengthened and better enforced by the Member States, bearing in mind the requirements and the specific nature of the fight against organised crime. I therefore ask the Commission how it intends to proceed and whether it intends to submit a proposal to remove the Member States’ discretion in the transposition of Articles 3 and 4 of the framework decision, concerning the grounds for mandatory non-execution and optional non-execution. With regard to the grounds for optional non-execution, I also ask whether it may not be appropriate to restrict them in the case of offences typically attributable to organised crime, including the offence of association with a mafia organisation, for which double criminality should not apply anyway.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before the vote, I should like to take a few moments to remind the House, the Council and the European Commission that two years ago, there was an earthquake in L’Aquila in which 309 people died and over 1 650 people were injured. Now I have raised the matter, I will send all MEPs today a video that was filmed in L’Aquila on 13 January. I urge all colleagues to look at it because the citizens of L’Aquila are waiting for a strong response from Europe. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask my fellow Member if thousands of deaths are not a matter to think over and reflect on for a long time, seeing as she just said that we do not have sufficient reason to believe that nuclear power is dangerous.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the emergency situation is teaching the European policy on asylum and immigration a serious lesson It is again evident that the EU does not have a legislative and operational framework that enables it to cope with extraordinary but not unforeseeable events, such as the events of recent months in North Africa. Lampedusa, Italy and Southern Italy are paying for these mistakes, but the main ones to pay are the refugees who are received in such an inhumane manner. Despite Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and the principle of equitable sharing of solidarity, all the countries are actually concerned only with their own affairs and the attitude of France, which shares a border with Italy, is unacceptable in the current European scenario. In this regard, I urge the Commission to consider the possibility of seeking an explanation from the French Government. For years, the EU has entered into agreements with third countries run by dictatorships, funding their activities and putting business interests before democratic requirements. Europe has remained silent before the Libyan raids: does it also intend to remain silent in the face of the unsustainable situation of the tent camps? Of course, we all agree that we cannot make deals with Colonel Gaddafi, yet, a few months ago, I did not hear any objections to the Italy-Libya treaty, which has led to the immigration issue being addressed in the most inhuman way. Today, President Berlusconi tried to use the same approach with Tunisia, offering money. Perhaps, though, the new Tunisian Government has learned its lesson. Yet, like it or not, it is the responsibility of the EU and the 27 Member States to take action, bearing in mind the overriding priority of international solidarity and the protection of human rights. For this reason, I hope that the European Commission proposes the introduction of the emergency procedure laid down in Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection as soon as possible, and that this proposal is adopted by the Council in the near future, because otherwise it will be in vain. I also call for a parliamentary delegation, not a delegation of political groups, to be sent to Lampedusa to verify both the humanitarian conditions of the immigrants and the non-refoulement
 principle. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to speak before you highlighted Parliament’s determination to call for the resignation of the other MEP, the last MEP, who has not yet resigned.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as some have said, Baroness Ashton, you have shown great courage by taking the bull by the horns in this case, but I think there are a number of basic steps to be taken. Meanwhile, you have spoken about bringing the guilty parties to justice. Let us call them by their real name: we need to bring Mr Gaddafi to justice. You also spoke about violence. Instead, I think it is right to say that genocide is taking over in these territories, yet again. We cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand. I think the first thing we need to do is to recognise the Libyan National Council, a transitional council. We must have an interlocutor; we cannot carry on speaking only of sharply reduced humanitarian aid. There is no doubt that we must all speak up for a no-fly zone. We cannot continue accepting the vetoes of China and Russia, countries that are run by dictators. China censors the Internet while Russia kills journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya. I think that right now, the first thing to do is to begin setting out our stall and recognise the Libyan National Council. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that events in the Middle East have made it clear to the European institutions that they cannot continue to ignore the violation of fundamental rights and of national constitutions. Please forgive me but I must again report a shameful action by the ruling majority in Italy, which would like to save Mr Berlusconi from the trials that have just begun over serious crimes such as extortion and exploitation of child prostitution. The Italian majority, in fact, called on the Constitutional Court to decide which court should try Mr Berlusconi. Certainly, the Constitutional Court will throw out the request of a judge on a personal basis, but we must not continue to ignore Mr Berlusconi’s umpteenth attack on Italian democracy and the independence of the Italian judiciary. Many colleagues have already signed a petition to send out a strong signal that will reach the Italian people from their own MEPs. It is a curious coincidence, Mr President, that while Mr Berlusconi has been attacking the judiciary for years, the Minister for Justice, Mr Alfano, has ingenuously come to Strasbourg to describe the plan for making justice efficient and cannot find a single moment to meet the European Parliament. Perhaps he is afraid to face uncomfortable questions from the representatives of the people concerning the Italian justice system and the way people are trying to destroy its independence?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so immediately willing and far-sighted in offering Italy assistance, although the assistance was rejected in the first instance by the Italian Government itself. Commissioner, you have rightly stressed the need to support Tunisia at this time of democratic transition. However, I wonder, and I ask you all: what has happened to the money that Europe has been pouring into Tunisia all these years and which it is still pouring into Libya, which – as we know – are democratic regimes? Therefore, it is now wonderful and amazing to cheer this awakening of the Tunisian people, although I wonder how on earth all that money was ever granted. If the Libyans woke up tomorrow, what conclusion would we draw from that? Would we have thought yet again that we had been funding democratic regimes, only to realise the next day that we had been implementing a disastrous policy instead? I ask myself, Commissioner, how on earth Europe has kept quiet about this democratic awakening, while only the United States has offered strong guidance in this respect. I would like to pick up on what Mr Portas and Mr Tavares said. They pointed out, extraordinarily, that in countries like Tunisia, emigration is viewed as a crime. To begin with, regarding all the people who have landed on Lampedusa – and I would remind Mr Madlener that they are not Libyans but Tunisians, although that is hardly important because Libyans will soon be arriving as well – who will decide whether they are refugees or not, given that a situation of extreme confusion reigns in Tunisia at the moment? Above all, however, how will we feel if we repatriate these people, in the knowledge that they will be thrown into prison as soon as they arrive? These, then, are the points that I believe we should be thinking about, and, above all, we should realise that racist policies like those implemented by the Italian Government have unfortunately produced only highly negative results.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is barely credible for the European institutions to still want to conclude a framework agreement with a dictatorship like Libya. We cannot go on saying that Libya has very important trading relations with European Union Member States and acts as a partner for the European Union in the Mediterranean basin, and putting respect for human rights as a secondary issue. The primary condition for us to be able to start a credible dialogue with Libya is for that country to ratify the Geneva Convention. We cannot barter economic interests for human lives: not just the lives of Libyan citizens, but also of people from other countries who are fleeing civil wars and religious persecution and pass through Libya only to find death and horrendous torture. We have a duty not to forget the thousands of calls for help made by people held in Libyan prisons. We cannot forget the horrors that Gandufa prison revealed to us. Libyan citizens do not enjoy many political and civil rights, such as freedom of expression, assembly and association. The oral amendment by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which seeks to replace the term ‘treaty’ in recital B with ‘agreements between Italy and Libya on joint coastal patrols’ is absolutely unacceptable, and the Italian delegation from Italia dei Valori
 will vote against it. The agreement between Italy and Libya is much more complex: it is a treaty with precise conditions regarding more complex issues than joint coastal patrols. For the European Parliament to remain credible, it needs to call a spade a spade, even if that may be embarrassing. A separate discourse needs to be entered into for the UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency, which is unable to carry out its work in Libya and is accused by the Libyan regime of incredible abuses and crimes. Are these the bases on which agreements should be conducted? We cannot deal with either terrorists or dictators. We are the European Parliament, not the board of directors of an economic giant.

Renewable energy sources exclude the incineration of the non-biodegradable part of waste. Since 1992, Italy has provided incentives by increasing its citizens’ energy bills and building incinerators, which are scientifically proven to be bad for people’s health and the environment and which the European Union has thus classified as a residual integrated waste management option. Two infringement procedures have been launched with regard to these incentives and, despite formal legislative intervention, in Italy, waste incineration is still being encouraged as a source of renewable energy, with the Acerra case being just one example of this. I realise that it may be difficult for you to remember the details of the situation concerning the CIP 6, which is why I have submitted a written question. However, I would ask you to confirm that incentives may not be provided for the incineration of non-biodegradable waste as a source of renewable energy and that there are no derogations in place for this. I would also like to know whether it is not considered inconsistent for the Waste Directive to establish incineration as a residual waste disposal option, while Directive 2001/77/EC encourages it as a form of renewable energy. Does the Commission intend to review this matter? Sonia Alfano,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the Italian Government’s propaganda, which was soon disproved by the Commission, the waste crisis in Campania is a structural problem that is anything but resolved. Questionable lists aside, we need to realise one thing: the people of Campania continue to live – and die – surrounded by waste. The local, regional and national politicians, on the right and on the left, have an enormous responsibility. The task of solving the problem cannot be offloaded on to the citizens, who are already suffering from completely unhealthy living conditions. The European Union must insist that a worthy solution is found, or else its intervention will have been in vain. The construction of incinerators, which, by the way, are financed as renewable energy sources and thereby infringe current European legislation, will not solve the issue. The waste would be turned into ash, causing harmful and deadly emissions. Pursuant to the Waste Directive, incinerators shall be the last option in a hierarchy of integrated waste systems that presents virtuous alternatives that have no public health or environmental impact but instead create employment. As far as Mafia infiltration is concerned, I feel it should be acknowledged that, while Mafia infiltration, particularly in the field of waste, does happen in the south, it happens primarily in the north. This has been especially true over the last few years. I therefore have three questions for the Commission: what action does it intend to take to ensure that the solution to the problem does not affect people’s health, and how does it intend to prevent decisions from being imposed on the public and areas from actually becoming militarised? Does it think that the immediate launch of a cancer registry for the entire region should be one of the conditions for closing the infringement procedure? What is the Commission’s assessment of Law No 210 of 2008 and, in particular, of Article 9 on incentives for the construction of incinerators, in which European legislation on State aid is clearly infringed?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a number of years, many families in Italy and just as many Romanian children have been suffering the consequences of Romania’s block on international adoptions. The Hague Convention is the benchmark framework to be implemented uniformly in all countries of the European Union, and Romania needs to make an effort to adjust to it. If Romania believes that the block on international adoptions works to protect children – for example, from the risk that a market for the illegal trafficking of children would be created – it must also deal with this problem with the help of the European Union, by toughening up controls and introducing strict regulations. However, we need to make an effort to ensure that many respectable families can adopt children, who deserve a second chance for a happy childhood. I would therefore ask the Commission how it intends to support a possible commitment from Romania to remove the moratorium on international adoptions and, furthermore, I should like to know the Commission’s position on the possibility of creating a European adoption agency, including in the light of the studies carried out.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 and 14 January, a referendum was held at the Fiat plant at Mirafiori in which both blue- and white-collar workers were asked to vote for or against the recovery plan for the plant in Turin. The plan is based on a new collective agreement that undermines workers’ fundamental rights relating to illness and strike action, and even the midday break during eight hours’ work on an assembly line. The referendum is illegitimate because the chief executive officer, Mr Marchionne, has threatened workers that if the agreement is rejected, the business is likely to abandon manufacturing in Italy and move elsewhere. This strategy of fear, of unbridled capitalism without consideration for rules or rights, was supported by the government and even by much of the Democratic Party, an opposition party that has its roots in the Italian Communist Party. The only unions to oppose the agreement were the Italian Federation of Metalworkers (FIOM) and the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL), and they were ousted from the union representation. In any case, the referendum passed with just 54% of the votes. As a result of this agreement, workers’ rights in Italy have slipped back several decades. Europe should know this and bear it in mind.

 I think it was a good idea for the Commission to attend Parliament today to report on the ban on the use of unenriched cages for laying hens, which will enter into force from January 2012. The implementation data are not very encouraging and, hence, very tough action is required against Member States that, out of indolence, have not made any progress for a while. The prohibition of these cages has been known since 1999, and those Member States that joined later were perfectly aware of having to take action on this issue according to precise timescales. Delay is unacceptable. Deadlines must be respected to make the European Union’s actions credible. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union requires the EU to enforce its policies, bearing in mind the welfare of animals as sentient beings. We must not always hide behind the problem of competitiveness, which should not be considered as an issue of quantity and prices but, above all, of quality, environmental sustainability and ethics, too. The critical and aware consumer must be at the heart of a new economic model that the EU should spearhead. I therefore hope that the Commission will proceed swiftly and determinedly to implement Council Directive 1999/74/EC, to protect both animals and consumers. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been following the legislative procedure for the European citizens’ initiative very closely and I am happy – partly on the basis of the statements by the Council and the Commission – that the first petitions will be launched a year from now. I am also proud to be able to announce to the European Parliament that in Italy a broad grassroots movement of citizens, associations and committees has sprung up in the wake of the approval of the outrageous directive on animal research. This movement will not sit on its hands this year, but will work to prepare a proposal for the Commission: a proposal to give the European Union modern and civilised laws and that says ‘no’ to animal testing – a cruel and scientifically ineffective practice – while strongly encouraging alternative methods. Saying ‘no’ to vivisection must be an objective of the European Union, since it is a desire of its citizens. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is well known that the activities of the Italian Government represent a constant violation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We only need to think of the agreement between Italy and Libya, which succeeded in infringing dozens of articles of the Charter, or the proposed ‘bavaglio
’ law that set out to gag the press and the legal system. We are talking about a government supported by a parliament elected in an undemocratic manner, without allowing citizens the chance to express a preference, a government that yesterday won a vote of confidence with votes from the opposition benches from Members of Parliament who publicly admitted that they had been approached with promises of standing at future elections and cash for votes.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union cannot back down from the energy challenge that will decide the fate of the planet. We must dispel the myth that the economic development of a country is closely tied to an increase in energy consumption. Europe must pioneer a new sustainable economic model, based on lower use of resources, including energy, with greater productivity. We must therefore break the link between economic growth and an increase in energy sold to industries and the public and instead link it to an increase in energy services that create employment and energy efficiency. For these reasons, I believe that energy efficiency represents a priority for the future of the EU, in both economic and environmental terms, and I hope that the Commission will immediately take the necessary measures to implement the binding objectives that Parliament established today.

 Mr President, notwithstanding the European Convention on Human Rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union and the national constitutions, serious violations of human rights persist on a daily basis in the European Union and in the Member States. In my country – Italy – there is a regime in force in which freedom of the press is violated, political parties take part in elections by submitting fake signatures, State secrecy covers up violent attacks (including by the Mafia), our Prime Minister – though not for much longer, we hope – profits from international cooperation with regimes like those in Russia and Libya, as was also confirmed by WikiLeaks. The European Union cannot allow itself to turn a blind eye to all of this. For these reasons, I support the report, which contains many of the amendments submitted by me and approved in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Amongst these, I should like to single out paragraphs 20 and 40, which call for human rights violations to be monitored and penalised, and for national legislative proposals with the potential to violate human rights to be frozen before they become law, until the EU approves them. I also supported the incentive to use Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union to address human rights violations and to bolster the mandate of the Agency for Fundamental Rights. The report makes numerous positive references to minorities, rights, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, immigrants and asylum seekers, freedom of the press and social rights. For these reasons, I would urge my fellow Members to vote in favour of the report. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciate the work carried out by the two rapporteurs. However, the problem with this draft directive is that it is based on the most usual kind of stalking, in which a person has been a victim of violence by another and therefore must be defended against a repeat of whatever physical or mental abuse took place. Obviously, this is a matter of fundamental importance for hundreds of thousands of women in the European Union and therefore I fully support its content. Unfortunately, however, these measures do not take into account the victims of organised crime who, in the majority of cases, do not need to be defended from an identified or identifiable person, but from organisations against which a restraining order certainly cannot be applied. Therefore, I think that the European Parliament should regard this directive as a first step in implementing the Stockholm Programme, which talks expressly about measures to protect the victims of criminal activity, and it seems to me that Mrs Jiménez and Commissioner Reding are of the same mind. I appeal to the European Commission to ensure that the package of measures to protect victims, which is planned for 2011, also protects victims of organised crime and victims injured in the course of duty on a European level.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that, in the final version of the report, involvement in criminal organisations for offences relating to the trafficking of human beings is an aggravating factor that doubles the minimum penalties from five to ten years in prison. In addition, Article 6a makes explicit reference to the seizure and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds from this kind of offence. This approach – which I believe is absolutely right and I hope may also be carried over to other legislation – looks the facts in the face and recognises that the trafficking of people for various forms of exploitation, such as, for example, prostitution, criminal activities and organ trafficking, is carried out by international criminal organisations. I am also pleased with the provisions of Article 7, which directs Member States not to prosecute people for their involvement in criminal activities that they have been compelled to commit as victims of trafficking. Often, in fact, those who suffer the violence of trafficking not only suffer injuries, but also the insult of being incriminated for doing what they were compelled to do, prostitution being a typical example. Therefore, I support the report and I should like to thank the two rapporteurs. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 There is nothing more inhuman than exploiting the lives of other living beings for profit, infringing every fundamental right. Trafficking in human beings is one of the basest activities in history; it is a widespread and highly complex phenomenon. I am pleased that Parliament has approved at first reading the proposal for a directive on trafficking in human beings. This is a significant step forward in combating the phenomenon, which is the main activity of a large number of international criminal organisations. The most important point is the recognition that organised crime is the main problem to tackle. The EU is finally making a real, explicit distinction between crime and organised crime, because the latter is a truly separate issue. There are many other positive elements such as a broader definition of exploitation, greater protection for victims and the rule stipulating that victims of trafficking shall not be charged for crimes they have been forced to commit as a result of violence or the threat of violence against them. As Amnesty International points out, often women who are victims of trafficking are arrested for prostitution, or are not guaranteed full access to justice. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 As the statements by the government representatives of numerous States demonstrate, the extraordinary zeal with which Julian Assange is being investigated is clearly designed to punish him and WikiLeaks for having revealed certain top secrets to the world, such as the concerns of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who asked the US embassies in Rome and Moscow for information on any personal investments of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Putin that might influence the foreign or economic policies of their respective countries. Mr Berlusconi is described as Mr Putin’s spokesman in Europe. Clearly, what is taking place here is the unprecedented punishment and persecution of a man and an organisation whose only crime is to have made the world aware of certain grey areas that put governments in an uncomfortable position. Hence, it is our duty to protect the freedom of WikiLeaks and to guarantee fair treatment for Julian Assange, who should pay for his crimes, if proven, in a fair trial. I therefore call on the Commission to state its position on the WikiLeaks affair and to explain how it intends to monitor the situation so that this affair is not used to clamp down on freedom of information and to impose restrictions on the Internet, which has once again proved to be an exceptionally powerful democratic instrument, and which must therefore be protected.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the energy efficiency policies implemented so far by the various Member States for 2020 will not enable us to achieve the target of a 20% reduction in energy consumption; we will be lucky to manage 10%, which is a decidedly disappointing result. If energy consumption continues to increase, achieving the 20% renewable energy target may also be in jeopardy, since that target is calculated as a proportion of the EU’s final energy consumption. I am firmly in favour of setting a binding target for energy efficiency also, so as to ensure that Europe’s climate and energy policies are mutually reinforcing. Unfortunately, the facts suggest that counting on the goodwill of individual Member States is not going to work. The European Union must show the way with clear and effective policies and objectives. Let us stop investing in new facilities to produce more energy, and let us plough our money and our efforts into the cleanest energy in the world, energy that we can avoid using. Lastly, I call for the adoption of Amendment 2, which calls on the Commission to launch an initiative on the energy performance of existing buildings in 2011. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 18 December 1990, the UN adopted the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. This Convention is one of the UN’s nine main instruments on human rights. Unfortunately, 20 years later, none of the Member States of the European Union have signed or ratified that Convention. I believe that recognising the rights of third-country nationals who live and work legally in the European Union must be a priority for a Europe which faces new challenges in relation to integration, non-discrimination and protection of human rights. For this reason, I ask all Members to support Amendment 16 and to sign Written Declaration 96 – to which I am a signatory, together with Cornelia Ernst, Sylvie Guillaume and Franziska Keller – in order to petition Member States to ratify the UN Convention on migrant workers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the Belet report because it recognises and specifies the fundamental role played by public sector broadcasting in Europe. I see this as an important step for Parliament, which is clearly stating that public broadcasting needs to remain independent of political power. This report seems to have been written specially for Italy, where the RAI is now at an advanced stage of decomposition because it has been taken over completely by party politics, to the detriment of the cultural and informational depth of public broadcasting and, hence, of the entire country. Just look at what happened last week on the programme called ‘Vieni via con me’ (‘Come away with me’). The Minzolinis and Masis of broadcasting, professionals of public disinformation and their paymasters, are incompatible with the report that Parliament has adopted today. The European Union should take note and act accordingly. We want no more party politics on the RAI! Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of information about prescription-only medicinal products is a sensitive subject because it has an important effect on the protection of the right to health and welfare of all citizens. The European Commission sent us a proposal on the revision of the directive that risked opening a loophole in the legislation, which would have allowed pharmaceutical companies to exploit an unclear distinction between the definitions of information and advertising to promote their prescription-only medicinal products, to the detriment of the people. Of course, there is still much to do with regard to a suitable strategy for information on medicinal products, but fortunately this time the European Parliament has reacted as it always should. Parliament has taken a stand to protect citizens and defend a patient’s right to better information, and it has not given in to pressure from pharmaceutical companies. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Evans on the recast of the directive because I really regret the fact that in the compromise text, which was adopted due to strong pressure from industrial lobbies, all references to PVC and halogenated fire retardants have disappeared, even though all the studies carried out by the Commission have demonstrated since as far back as 2000 that the disposal of these substances poses serious risks for human health and the environment. Transferring the costs of industry to the environment and to citizens is an approach that we absolutely cannot support because, in addition to distorting the free market, it represents an unacceptable trade-off between peoples’ quality of life and the profits of business. I hope the next time the directive is updated, in three years’ time, that citizens' right to health and environmental protection will be placed right at the forefront. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have read the report carefully and I endorse it overall. However, I was left rather puzzled by various references to the future of coal in the European strategy, in particular in paragraph 52, in which the Commission is asked to draw up legal provisions to facilitate the building of coal-fired electric power plants. Several years ago in the United States, a political and citizens’ movement was started which has de facto 
led to a sort of moratorium on the building of coal-fired power plants. As well as CO2
 emissions, this decision is also based on the problem of dealing with the ash, which contains many toxic substances. Therefore, I absolutely do not support the defence of coal-fired power plants and I would note that so called ‘clean coal is, in many cases, more of a slogan than a reality. I have also heard several fellow Members fiercely defend nuclear energy, in terms of both costs and safety. Unfortunately, whoever says this shows that they do not know what they are talking about. Alternatives exist, they are renewable, they are genuine, and the European Union must plot its path for the coming decade in that direction. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciate the presence of Commissioner Hedegaard and the stance she has taken. I should like to thank you for your commitment to keeping Parliament continually updated on the developments for Cancún. The fight against climate change must be conducted on a global level and with everyone’s involvement, but the idea that our position must depend on that of other countries is irresponsible and does not do justice to the role that the EU has set itself, namely a leading role in guiding cultural revolutions at a global level, primarily the fight against climate change. We must set ourselves ever more ambitious targets and ensure that they are reached by the various Member States. I therefore thank the Commissioner for having reminded Italy, a few days ago, to maintain its financial promises of EUR 200 million to combat climate change. Unfortunately, I must inform the Commission that the Italian Government’s budget does not seem to provide for these funds at the moment. I would therefore ask the Commission to use all the powers available to it to make the Member States keep their promises, particularly when it is a matter of such a significant battle for the near future of the people of the world ...

 Madam President, the disaster of April 2010 is one of the most serious environmental disasters ever to have happened in the world. If the same thing happened within a closed sea such as the Mediterranean, the lives of tens of millions of European and non-European citizens would be threatened, with no way back. Yet in Italy – as Lega Ambiente
 protested with regard to an ill-conceived energy policy – we are seeing an extraordinary increase in research applications and permits granted by the ministry for identifying and extracting oil resources that would be sufficient to cover the Italian energy requirement for little more than one year. It is obvious that the sacrifice is not worth it. All this is compounded by concern over the fact that BP has announced an agreement with Libya for offshore extraction just under 500 km south of Sicily. I hope that the Commission undertakes, through this now imminent measure, to defend life in the Mediterranean against the attacks of multinationals and governments who are complicit and care little about our collective welfare.

 Madam President, I would like to report to Parliament that last Sunday, during the Pope’s visit to Palermo, the Italian Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union were suspended. Freedom of expression and of thought and the inviolability of private homes were trampled over. On this occasion, the Italian police insisted on the removal of a banner bearing a phrase from the Gospel: ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves’, while the same police force put up posters that were homophobic and against common-law couples. Inside the bookshop Altro quando
, the owner had put up a banner bearing the phrase ‘I love Milingo’. The police entered the private premises and seized the banner without any court warrant and using methods that were unedifying even by their own standards. It is paradoxical that in a lay and democratic State, as Italy is supposed to be, public freedom of expression is suppressed by the authorities in order not to offend the papal sensibilities, while Prime Minister Berlusconi is able to swear in public without this representing a problem for the Church. On this occasion, all the lay and religious institutions yet again rode roughshod over democracy in Italy, increasing the unbridgeable gap that has now emerged between institutions and the public. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Saturday, the Italian newspaper Il fatto quotidiano
 published a document signed by the Mafioso former mayor of Palermo, Vito Ciancimino, in which he wrote that Marcello Dell’Utri and Silvio Berlusconi were cut from the same cloth as him; that they belonged to the same mafia-dominated political system. This news comes to the attention of the magistracy as the truth emerges about the mafia massacres of 1992, which saw the deaths of judges Falcone and Borsellino, namely, the State negotiated with the mafia for the end of the ‘season of bombs’ and this favoured, as appears to be the case, the establishment of the Prime Minister’s party, Forza Italia
, which was indeed founded with the help of Dell’Utri, sentenced to seven years for mafia association and still a senator in the Italian Parliament. In the light of this and in the light of the recent murder of Mayor Angelo Vassallo by the Camorra, I reiterate the importance of the request made by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which, as a result of my continual pressure, has once again asked the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for a report on organised crime at European Union level. Europe cannot continue to turn the other cheek for fear of tackling a problem which is no longer local but globalised, and which right now closely affects the government of a Member State.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, under Rule 175 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, I call for this document to be referred back to committee. We have been waiting for this directive for a great many years but, as has been stressed in several other speeches, there are some items that need to be thoroughly amended in order to ensure adequate protection for animals. Adoption of this legislation will allow for experimentation for teaching purposes and the reuse of the same animal several times, even in procedures that cause it to suffer. It will not in any way encourage alternative methods that are considered scientifically valid. This is not a matter of adopting an extreme position, but rather of respecting Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which requires us to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals since they are sentient beings. We do not want to hold back research, but rather to encourage it along an ethically sustainable course. It is unacceptable to say that we can adopt this directive now and amend it in the years to come. We should take responsibility for making the necessary corrections to it now. This is not a political or ideological position; it is common sense, and common sense has no political hue. Sonia Alfano,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all unfortunately aware of the information situation in Italy. We are classified as a partly free country by Freedom House and occupy 71st place along with the islands of Tonga, ranking only just above East Timor. The ‘gagging law’ is only the latest development in an overall situation in which the country’s democratic defences are being greatly weakened, in particular, due to the lack of free information. As the OECD indicates in its most recent report, the disintegration of democracy and of the vested rights to information and free expression is unfortunately spreading throughout Europe. We need only think of France, with its government-appointed top public television service executive, or Hungary, Estonia and Romania, which, after taking tough legal action to limit freedom of expression, are making it impossible for information to play its essential democratic role as government watchdog. For this reason, I believe it is the Commission’s duty to make a strong, consistent commitment to defending media and information freedom, in line with the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. I therefore ask the Commission what action it intends to take to promote genuine media pluralism in the EU Member States and, in particular, when it will issue the communication on indicators for media pluralism, which was promised for 2010, together with the associated legislative proposal. I would not like to think that, as with the expulsion of the Roma in France, the Commission is tempted to give up its defence of freedom and democracy in Europe in order to cover up the work of Member State governments, which are increasingly concerned with hiding their wrongdoings from the press and the public. I hope that you, and also Commissioner Reding, will be able to reassure me on this point. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with you, Mr President, that it is the European Union’s duty to play a fundamental role in international issues and that we must speak with one, strong voice. It is most certainly our responsibility to intervene promptly and decisively each time human rights are oppressed, no matter where in the world that happens. I hope that the next six months of the Belgian Presidency will be distinguished by an unwavering commitment on those issues. To demonstrate that commitment, I ask for immediate attention to be paid to what is happening in certain Libyan prisons in the Sahara Desert: 250 Eritrean citizens, including women and children, have been shut up for days in inhumane conditions, in violation of all international regulations on human rights and asylum. Many of these citizens were denied political refugee status, even though they met all the necessary requirements. The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Frattini, actually accused the European Union of not even having published a press release. I think now is the time for the European Union to speak with one, strong voice. Right now, we must not turn our heads and look the other way, because 250 people are asking us to save them from death.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the right to petition is one of the main instruments available to European citizens for active participation in the political activities of the European Union. In approaching my mandate as an MEP in the spirit of service and respect for the citizen, and the priority that this must have in the decisions of the European Parliament, I have often taken an interest in the petitions submitted ... (The President asked the speaker to speak more slowly)
 I have often taken an interest in the petitions submitted and in their progress in the relevant committee. Unfortunately, despite the fact that Parliament’s Rules of Procedure stipulated, in Rule 5(3), that Members shall be entitled to inspect any files held by Parliament or a committee, I have discovered that the internal e-Petition 
database is only accessible to members of the relevant committee. I contacted the committee in question but, unfortunately, did not receive a response. I think that this discrimination, which reduces the importance of citizen’s petitions and undermines the work of the parliamentary committee, ought to be redressed immediately.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is undoubtedly a good piece of work and I should like to compliment the rapporteur on it. One of the first phrases of the explanatory statement struck a very positive chord with me, and I would like to quote it directly: ‘waste management policy must transform the EU into a recycling society’. However, I do detect some contradictions there. For example, the fact that separate collection is mandatory as long as it is the best option from both the environmental and economic standpoints. In other words, investments made by Member States in this area are not to be subject to discussion even if they are contrary to European guidelines. In this way, as has already been seen with the framework directive on waste, the European Union will provide little more than a suggestion. Plus, we forget – by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, which the European institutions all too often hide behind – that it is our duty to provide ambitious and incisive responses to the problem of waste. Let us fix targets for separate collection and stipulate their fulfilment. Let us use best practices, like the ‘zero waste’ policies enacted in some parts of the USA and make them binding for all Member States. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Cashman report because I believe it is the responsibility of this House and of the European institutions to abide by and uphold the commitments made to people who live in less developed countries, in particular, the countries of Africa. We cannot get to 2015 and realise that the eight goals that we set ourselves have not been achieved, because behind the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, behind these percentages – let us not forget this – there are billions of people who are suffering and do not have the opportunity to live in dignity. The European Union must set an example and lead the way as far as development assistance is concerned. Public debt cancellation, together with a greater commitment to ensuring that aid is put to good use, is one of the key points of this solidarity-based project, the achievement of which – we have to be aware – cannot be postponed without sacrificing more human lives.

According to a survey published by the Region of Sicily at the end of 2009, 75% of citizens believe that European funds have no positive impact whatsoever, or very little. If we then consider that, according to the Court of Auditors, 51% of resources earmarked to Sicily for the 2000-2006 programming period were not spent and that a good percentage of the funds utilised were blighted by irregularities, we can easily understand the almost total lack of public trust. I therefore fully support the report by my fellow Member. Only total transparency with the aim of ensuring that the public is made aware of the effective use of public resources can restore trust in the institutions. Anyone must be able to know to whom funds are allocated and, above all, to what end they are directed, while also being able to follow all stages from programming to the implementation of interventions. Enabling citizens to monitor European funds not only represents a fundamental manifestation of the democratic process but also constitutes a deterrent to any form of siphoning off of those public resources. I remind you that transparency does not merely mean making documents public: that is only the first step. Information must be accessible and easily intelligible; otherwise, its production will be merely a technical exercise that does not serve the purpose of any democratic control. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me a moment. (The speaker pretends to gag herself for a few seconds, to show that she cannot speak)
 This is what would happen in Italy if a law tabled and approved last week in the Italian Senate, the ‘draft law on wiretapping’, were also to be approved in the Chamber. This decree-law more or less bans journalists, bloggers – everyone – from publishing wiretaps. This is clearly unconstitutional, and is also against the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights which states, in Article 11, that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, as well as to receive and impart information. I would like to use a single example to focus the attention of the European institutions, because this really is an incredible form of censorship. I would like to use an example that is striking, evident and real. My father was a journalist killed by the Mafia and over the last seven years the true circumstances surrounding that Mafia murder have come to light through wiretaps. Through wiretaps, we were able to discover that he died because a fugitive was hiding in the area where we lived. I therefore call the attention of the European institutions to this matter.

 As regards the Ţicău report, I voted in favour of the common position on updating the directive on the energy performance of buildings, because the aim is that, from the end of 2020, all newly constructed buildings will have an energy balance equal to zero, an aim that the European institutions must make every effort to achieve. Europe has a shared commitment, and is firmly convinced that in the near future, it will not be necessary to produce more energy, but to make better use of that which is already produced. Energy saving and energy efficiency effectively represent a source of energy production. We do not need to wait ten years to move in this direction; instead, Member States need to commit as of now to achieving energy efficiency targets, using financial resources that, until today, have been dedicated to producing greater quantities of energy. I remind you especially of the iniquitous launch of the nuclear programme in Italy, which damaged and endangered the health of citizens and the environment. A huge quantity of public resources was wasted on this launch in order to produce, in less than twenty years, the same quantity of energy that we could do without if we were to invest the same resources in energy efficiency right now. Green investments for our children, not radioactive waste! I will now move on to the explanation of vote for the Rühle report. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 I voted in favour because I think it is important for Parliament to support the simplification and rationalisation of public procurement law. This will make work easier both for administrative bodies and for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which will find it easier to participate in tenders. I consider it essential to refer to the use of public procurement as a means of encouraging paths of sustainable development, by introducing environmental and social criteria within invitations to tender. I also think that it is the duty of this Parliament and of the European institutions to continue pressing for all-round transparency surrounding the use of public money, particularly with regard to public procurement, using all possible means and especially the Internet. Citizen control represents a crucial contribution for using public funds in a way that is genuinely in the collective interest and, as the Committee on Regional Development reminds us, for fighting the corruption that prevails within local and regional authorities.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of Parliament’s resolution on the new Digital Agenda for Europe because I believe that guaranteeing easy and affordable broadband access to the entire population is a strategic priority for the European Union. Extending Internet use means broadening and developing citizens’ freedom of expression, favouring their participation in democratic life and permitting the dissemination of knowledge and innovations. What I would like to highlight is that the spread of broadband in Europe would guarantee broader freedom of information. As noted by Eurostat, we must not forget that Europe also has two or possibly three speeds as regards the spread of the Internet. Italy, especially in some regions, as well as Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Portugal, are the least developed States in this sense. It is no accident that in the Freedom of the Press index for 2009 drawn up by Freedom House,
 Italy was listed among the partially free states, in last place in western Europe together with Turkey, and 72nd in the world together with Benin and India and preceded by Tonga. I also hope that thanks to these resolutions and the principles that have been mentioned, the Italian Government will decide to release the investment of EUR 800 million as soon as possible which was intended to break down the digital divide in Italy and which, according to a statement by Gianni Letta, the Deputy Secretary to the Italian Council of Ministers, is not a priority at the moment. I would like to emphasise that the quality of the service in Italy is inadequate for current needs and that for years consumer associations have been complaining that the access costs are among the least competitive in Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 16 people convicted of various types of crime have been elected to the Italian Parliament and, at the last European elections, Italy sent three MEPs who have been convicted by final judgment. There is no law in Europe prohibiting people who have been convicted by final judgment, or who are awaiting further legal proceedings, from standing for election; everything is left to the discretion of the Member States. Italian citizens have come up with the ‘Clean Parliament’ programme. We therefore call on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to amend the Act concerning the election of representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage to make it a condition, in order to stand for election to the European Parliament, not to have any criminal convictions, including those that have not become final. The Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in the last Parliament, Mr Leinen, undertook to do this, but everything was left to his successor, Mr Casini, who has already stated that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will not pursue it. We would point out that not only is this the responsibility of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but that Article 223 (formerly 190) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union actually stipulates that the European Parliament should implement a uniform electoral procedure throughout the European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, my political group. On 5 March, the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, signed an interpretative decree-law, also known as the ‘save list’ decree-law. In fact, this decree allows the rules of the game to be changed after the electoral campaign has started. On the website of the Quirinal Palace, Giorgio Napolitano himself states that, unlike the draft decree proposed to him by the government in a tense meeting on Thursday evening, in his view, the text subsequently drafted by the Ministry of the Interior and the Prime Minister did not present obvious defects of an unconstitutional nature. Article 87(5) of the Italian Constitution lays down that the President of the Italian Republic shall promulgate laws and issue decrees with the force of law, and regulations. The President of the Republic absolutely cannot participate in the drafting of procedures and of decree-laws. The President of the Republic’s predecessor, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, considers it to be an aberrant distortion of our democratic system. It is clear that the government is doing what the constitution prohibits. That decree, Mr President, has changed the rules of the game for an electoral competition that has already begun and allows those who have broken the law to stand, having been readmitted to the electoral competition. I wonder why Parliament is always ready to take a stand against countries that violate laws but does not acknowledge that there is a country among the 27 Member States that is violating laws.

Mr President, if, instead of all this squabbling, we had had the opportunity to take the floor, we perhaps could have also done our electorate a good turn, since it is 10 o’clock in the evening and we all knew that we should have taken the floor. Every one of us comes here to voice the demands of our electorate. One minute of speaking time is already very little, and shortening the list is, in my view, also rather arrogant.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Gas Natural
, a Spanish holding company, has submitted a project for on-shore regasification plants which would affect the Trieste area, and which has been approved by the Italian Ministry of the Environment. The Trieste regasification plant technical board has highlighted some important shortcomings. Following the informal meeting that took place between the European Commission, Italy and Slovenia on 26 January 2010, the Italian Permanent Representative to the European Union publicly speculated that the European Union had approved the project, whilst the official word from Slovenia is that the opposing sides have been called upon to reach an agreement. This accord will probably be difficult to achieve in practice, because of the atypical background to the regasification plant affair. In fact, it turns out that the bodies responsible for providing guarantees and for safety have failed to comply with their protection duties. Significant delays in drawing up external emergency plans and in communicating with public bodies and authorities responsible for managing emergencies have been highlighted, as has a failure to inform the public about the risks of serious accidents concerning codes of conduct, and the absence of an objective assessment of the domino effect caused by a possible accident in high-risk industrial plants. For these reasons, we believe this is yet another attempt to set up a high-risk plant, in the knowledge that there are absolutely no protection and safety measures in place. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw Parliament’s attention to the rules on company transfers contained in Directive 2001/23/EC. I am saying this because Eutelia S.p.A., an Italian company operating in the field of telecommunications and information technology, counts among its clients some very important businesses, but not just businesses: for example, it also provides services for the Bank of Italy, the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Italian Senate. Furthermore, it is involved with the Schengen project, so it manages some very confidential data. In May 2009, Eutelia all but divested itself of its IT branch, transferring it to its subsidiary, Agile, which basically has a fund of only EUR 96 000 to pay its 2 000 employees. Subsequently, in October 2009, 1 192 people received redundancy notices. These people are still employed, despite having received redundancy notices. Moreover, the ridiculous thing is that the rule that I referred to just now imposes specific requirements of entrepreneurship on those who acquire parts of undertakings … (The President cut off the speaker) Sonia Alfano,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the European Crime Prevention Network. This network was set up in 2001 by Council Decision 2001/427/JHA. Its objectives were to facilitate cooperation and exchanges of information and experiences at national and European level; to collect and analyse relevant information aimed in particular at the exchange of best practices; to organise conferences, seminars, meetings and initiatives with the objective of facilitating the exchange of experiences and best practices; and to provide its expertise to the Council and the Commission concerning crime prevention. The Decision envisaged that the structure would be based on contact points designated by the Commission and the Member States; these contact points were to include at least one representative from the national authorities, while the other designated contact points could be researchers or university academics specialising in this field. Member States were, in any case, required to involve researchers, university academics, NGOs and civil society. Even Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction were involved in the work as expert bodies. In 2005, the network underwent its first internal structural reform. This foresaw the permanent establishment of two commissions – one for the work programme and one for research – while the running of the website was transferred from the European Commission to the United Kingdom, which still keeps it updated. In 2007, there was another review, which acknowledged the particular need to strengthen the secretariat and highlighted the need to confront the problem of resources for the permanent commissions and the national representatives. In March 2009, an external evaluation was published concerning the functioning of the network. This focused on the importance of the objectives that brought the network into being but, at the same time, regrettably highlighted the organisational failure that had impeded the achievement of the important objectives that we were speaking of earlier. The problems thus brought to light, which have led to the virtual collapse of the network, included the lack of suitable resources, an ineffective secretariat, lack of commitment on the part of the national representatives and a very poor work programme. The evaluation also considered the possibility of disbanding the network. In consequence, the network appointed a working group to examine the recommendations made in March 2009 and took the view that certain amendments needed to be made to the Act that created the network. In particular, it was suggested that there should be an external secretariat financed with funds from Community programmes. Although some Member States had revived the idea of disbanding the network, others suggested that it should be reformed. The Swedish Presidency of the European Council agreed with this proposal, to the extent of making it a priority in its own six-month term of office. At this point, I must stress how embarrassed I am to see these empty seats, given that these proposals were made by the Swedish Presidency itself. The proposal envisages that the network should be composed of a secretariat, of contact points designated by each Member State and of a board of directors. This board of directors should be made up of national representatives appointed by Member States and would be presided over by a chairman in charge of an executive committee. I think there is also some confusion in this respect between contact points and national representatives. Civil society, the academic world, the world of experience and hence, of experts, are all being completely left out of the network. This is a very serious matter. The structural links between the network and the other Community institutions and bodies that are concerned with crime and its prevention have been completely cut off. The Decision does not envisage any form of cooperation with the European Parliament and the requirement for knowledge of languages has been omitted, despite having been requested previously. Speaking as rapporteur, I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and is incapable of tackling crime prevention for several reasons. First, it has been unable to fulfil the objectives for which it was created; second, there has been no cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Member States, and I believe that this must be regarded as a sort of sabotage of the network itself. Crime prevention cannot be reduced to the exchange of best practices. Unfortunately, we have witnessed what is almost a type of tourism on the part of various officials who have visited various countries and have often not even managed to speak to one another because there were no interpreters. The failure to involve civil society and NGOs, or to develop materials on prevention such as books for schools, makes this network completely ineffective. To make the network function, I think we should strengthen its powers, and also incorporate the fight against crime and the prevention of organised crime. I therefore suggest that we reject this proposal, which could have been accepted only if the Council had presented a genuinely ambitious proposal. Unfortunately, this has not happened. Sonia Alfano,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Members who have taken part in this debate. I should, in particular, also like to thank Mr Barrot for having taken our concerns on board. Our proposed rejections are not unjustified: they are not intended as a simple ‘no’ to the Council. On the contrary, we should like to be involved, given that the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force within a few days, and I consider that Parliament’s role as colegislator is of fundamental importance. I had personally asked the Council formally to present a much more ambitious proposal on the European Crime Prevention Network and to do so immediately after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This proposal was not presented. Therefore, it proved truly necessary to reject the proposal, and I believe that Parliament has the right to operate on the basis of full codecision, especially regarding such important issues as this. I thank Mr Nicholson for what he said concerning the roles of victims and perpetrators, roles that are too often reversed. In the few months that I have been in Parliament, I have noted that Parliament and the European Union have accorded an extraordinary degree of importance to the fight against terrorism, while sadly there is a lack of will to address not only the fight against crime, but the organised crime that is at the root of it. It is impossible to imagine combating or preventing crime without considering the possibility of a more comprehensive operation to repress and prevent organised crime and the Mafia – as Mr De Magistris has stated, quoting the remarkable words of Judge Falcone, who was murdered by the Mafia. This said, I should like to make a small digression as someone who unfortunately has had first-hand experience of these matters. All too often, there is not only confusion between victim and perpetrator, but there are governments – and sadly the Italian Government has not paid much attention to this matter – which put victims of the same type of crime on a different footing from each other. Victims of terrorism are treated in one way, and victims of the Mafia in another. In my view, these differences and forms of discrimination cannot continue to exist, because such differences have absolutely no place in a Europe that aims to base its policy on innovation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to address the Commissioner, who maintained that it is not the job of this Parliament to resolve certain issues. I would point out, however, that it is the job of this Parliament to ensure that the Treaty and the Member States’ constitutions are respected. A few months ago, the Italian Minister for Justice declared that he had arranged for the imminent closure of some parts of YouTube and the Internet. I would point out that only in China do such things happen. Article 21 of the Italian Constitution decrees that the press may not be subject to authorisation or censorship. As other Members have already confirmed, Italy is the only country in which the Head of Government has a monopoly on public, and now also private, television channels and in which, unfortunately, a law is being passed that will, in fact, prevent journalists from publishing even judicial reports. This is because, were they to be published, Italians would probably learn about Mr Berlusconi’s part in the 1992 massacres, Mafia massacres in which Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino died.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you Mr Barrot and Mr Billström. Back on 31 August, I tabled a priority question to the Commission. It is true that the number of migrants reaching Italian and Libyan shores has fallen, but this is because the number of dead which the Mediterranean Sea continues to receive has risen. Alas, the Mediterranean has now become a mass grave and the Berlusconi Government, to wit, the Italian Government, has signed an agreement with Libya which unfortunately allows Italy to refuse entry not only to migrants, but also refugees from countries where there is persecution or civil war, such as Somalia and Eritrea, and denies these poor people the right to seek asylum, thereby breaching every international rule and the Geneva Convention in particular. I would remind you that non-refoulement is a principle which knows no geographical boundaries and which cannot be haggled over or negotiated under any circumstances. We do not want to continue thinking that ultimately, this Italy-Libya agreement boils down to economic interests worth around EUR 5 000 billion. I demand that the Commission does not – if this is its intention – conclude an EU-Libya agreement similar to the Italian one, as we have seen the results of that despicable agreement. I repeat, alas this agreement forces these people to undergo torture, because this is what we are dealing with: the detention centres to which they are taken in Libya are torture, according to press reports and also photographs, for example, photographs which show many of these immigrants in Ganfuda prison, 10 kilometres from Benghazi. This is torture, which I do not believe is accounted for in any friendship or institutional agreements. As highlighted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the non-refoulement principle prevents people being returned to territories where their lives could be considered to be in danger or their freedom could be threatened. Sending these people back to Libya which, I would again remind you, has neither signed nor ratified the Geneva Convention, seems truly unbelievable. Moreover, to add insult to injury, illegal immigration is a criminal offence in Italy so, for example, after the dramatic landing at the end of August in which many Somalis lost their lives, those few, I think four or five Somalis who managed to reach their destination have, among other things, been accused of immigration and are therefore now being prosecuted under Italian law. I call on the Commission now to take real action, to assess whether the Italy-Libya agreement complies with international law and finally bring about a decisive change of course by not supporting the Italian Government’s nefarious policy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate those who actively contributed to the adoption of the report on the Statute for a European cooperative society. I would like to emphasise the important role of the cooperative experience in Italy and Europe and of its impact on the territory, in particular, during the period of crisis we are currently going through. However, I must regretfully note that the European cooperative society (SCE) is not yet a success, given its scarce use: in 2010, only 17 SCEs were registered. This should make us question the applicability of the legal framework. I believe that today, more than ever, simplification is needed to enable small organisations to access information on national provisions for implementing regulations and directives. Furthermore, I think we need to remember the commitments undertaken by the Commission, in particular, to include cooperatives among the financial instruments of the European Investment Fund and to make explicit reference to more favourable conditions for cooperatives, such as easier access to loans and tax concessions. The Italian experience has shown that if cooperatives are supported by adequate instruments and concessions, they produce excellent results in terms of employment and society. Vincenzo Iovine  (ALDE

Mr President, I was pleased to play a part in approval of the scheme for distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union. At a time like this, when the number of deprived people in Europe has risen as a result also of the economic crisis, I believe that an important signal like today’s can contribute to greater cohesion in the European Union. This reminds me of the example of a Neapolitan saint. He was a doctor called Giuseppe Moscati. When he received patients in his surgery, he used to put his hat on the desk with the sides turned up, and a notice placed on it reading ‘Those who have please give, and those who don’t please take’.Andrea Zanoni,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let us stop ‘finning’! We must put a stop to indiscriminate capture of sharks in order to remove their precious and much sought-after fins before throwing the huge shark bodies back into the sea. There must be an end to exemptions for special permits. This is what Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has asked for in its opinion, on which I acted as rapporteur, which despite some opposition from the Committee on Fisheries, will be approved in full by this House tomorrow. The European Union, in line with the view of the scientific world, decided to outlaw finning in 2003, but the exemptions allowed by the current legislation make it impossible to combat a phenomenon that poses a serious threat to the survival of this particularly vulnerable species. There is no other way to go: only by making it mandatory for fins to be landed still naturally attached to the body can a simple and effective control of the ban on on-board finning be achieved. Encouraging conservation of shark stocks will bring about genuinely sustainable fishing. I therefore call on Parliament to support the proposal. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 2013 will rightly be the Year of European Citizens. This is an important initiative because recalling and enhancing awareness, in particular among young people, of the rights and achievements attached to European citizenship should be treated as an absolute priority. Today, thanks to the process of European integration, EU citizens may live, work, study and travel freely within the territory of the Member States, use the health services, enjoy rights and protection as passengers and consumers, and vote and stand as candidates in elections to the European Parliament and in municipal elections in their Member State of residence. These are important achievements, which bring with them not just a strong symbolic connotation that strengthens and promotes the sense of belonging to Europe, but also undoubted advantages and practical opportunities. However, according to a Eurobarometer report, and as I can confirm on a daily basis in my work as an MEP, there is often a lack of awareness of these rights, and of the values and principles that inspire them. It is therefore essential to make every effort, particularly in the schools but also elsewhere, to raise awareness of and provide information on the great advantages of our dual citizenship, the European aspect of which enhances and strengthens the national aspect.

Madam President, protection of passenger rights is an increasingly important issue, especially at times of crisis such as the present, when transport cost cutting and sudden airline bankruptcy in the sector can cause serious disruption to passengers. All too often we read in the newspapers of cancelled flights and hundreds of passengers left to fend for themselves, sometimes for days on end; not to mention rail delays and cancellations, leaving thousands of workers, students and whole families stranded, often without information on alternative modes of transport to bring them home or to work. Passengers must be guaranteed more price transparency and must be protected against unfair commercial practices, such as the addition of non-optional operational costs and excessive restrictions on hand luggage. Efforts must be made to provide multilingual information points to deal with rerouting and cancellation of flights and trains, in order to provide the best protection possible for European citizens. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, reforming the common fisheries policy is a necessary decision that cannot be put off any longer. We fish too much in Europe, and we often fish badly. If we want to safeguard marine biological resources, conserve the marine ecosystem and ensure the survival of the fisheries sector, we have to give overexploited fish stocks time to recover. However, the view that prevailed in this Chamber today by only a few votes was the blinkered view of those who want to maintain the status quo and continue to condemn our seas and the whole fisheries sector to certain death. That is why I voted against the report on the reform of the common fisheries policy. We need a well-thought-out reform that allows for the sustainable exploitation of marine resources and not a watered-down text that offers no future prospects. We need multiannual management plans and a precise timetable, as well as a network of protected areas. I welcome sanctions against those Member States that do not abide by the rules, carry out inadequate controls, exceed their quotas and do not provide reliable data. Greater protection for the fish in our seas means more jobs for European fishermen, but there are some people in this Chamber who have not yet understood that. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, the current global economic and environmental crisis requires us to make choices to save resources. With the Energy Efficiency Directive adopted today, we can achieve important goals, such as tackling the problem of climate change and the scarcity of fossil fuels, including coal and oil; cutting the annual cost of buying fuel, which amounts to EUR 400 billion, by making a potential saving of EUR 50 billion per year; reducing Europe’s dependency on Russia and OPEC countries, from which we import gas and oil; reducing air pollution, which, in some regions of Europe, currently poses an unfortunately unresolved threat to the health of millions of European citizens; creating new jobs and benefits for small and medium-sized enterprises, including installers and the building sector, which is currently going through a very serious crisis. I therefore welcome the rules introduced for the renovation of public buildings and for four-yearly energy audits, which are compulsory for all large enterprises. This is one of the many steps Europe needs to take. However, we need to do more: we must set ourselves more ambitious targets and take measures that are more binding on all Member States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today is a very important day for the health of European citizens. Indeed, this is, without doubt, one of the most important reforms of the entire parliamentary term when one considers the beneficial impact it will have on the health of European citizens. From today, the EU has stricter regulations and is establishing new upper limits on the sulphur content of marine fuels, which contain air pollutants that are estimated to cause as many as 50 000 premature deaths in Europe. For Northern European countries – the so-called Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) – a maximum sulphur content in fuels of below 0.1% comes into force from 2015 while, for all other countries, the limit will be 0.5% from 2020. We should no doubt have aimed higher; these new limits should have applied across the whole of the European Union. What price life, though? That is what thousands of European citizens are wondering in cities with major ports like that of my beautiful mistreated Venice, whose inhabitants and whose works of art are constantly being poisoned by smoke from the stacks of great ships. Well, thanks to Europe, that smoke will now be a little less black. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on the welfare of animals because it introduces important concepts for a better future for animals and European citizens. Issues including a new directive to protect dogs and cats, the violation of the directives on zoos and laying hens by many Member States, and maintaining the March 2013 deadline for cosmetics tested on animals must be addressed urgently and as a matter of priority. We also need to provide for mandatory labelling for meat from animals barbarically slaughtered without being stunned. We must adopt an EU law on animal welfare and set up a body that monitors whether the Member States enforce the rules on the industry. We can and we must, however, do much more for animal welfare. Modern, civilised Europe can no longer tolerate barbaric, uncivilised and backwards practices such as vivisection, hunting or bullfighting. Let us renounce these absurd activities right now, for a Europe that is more respectful of animals and more respectful of the views of its citizens, who are often much more far-sighted, caring and sensitive than national and EU authorities.

 In the resolution on the establishment of an EU legal framework for the protection of pets and stray animals, it is reiterated that the European Union is based on sharing different principles and values. Millions of European citizens attach a special sentimental value to animals and in particular to pets, such as dogs and cats. There are more than 100 million pets in Europe, but despite the large number, the EU still does not have an EU framework law to protect our pets and stray animals. With today’s vote, Parliament is giving a voice to thousands of European citizens and is urging the EU to establish a framework law to protect animals and in particular to lay down: rules for the identification and registration of animals; stray animal management strategies, including vaccination and sterilisation programmes; measures to promote responsible ownership; the prohibition of unlicensed kennels and shelters; the prohibition of killing of stray animals without medical indication; information and educational programmes in schools on animal welfare; and severe sanctions to be imposed on any Member State which fails to comply with the rules.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is life; water is a precious public asset that we have a duty and an interest in conserving and managing sustainably in order to safeguard ecosystems and the very survival of the human race. This important report takes stock of the implementation status of EU water legislation ahead of the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’, which the Commission has announced for this autumn. Much has been done in the 12 years since the Water Framework Directive entered into force, but there is still a huge amount left to do, especially in many southern European countries such as Italy, which is to appear before the Court of Justice because of delays in implementing the directive. We have to ensure sufficient availability of good-quality water, bearing in mind that water resources in Europe are distributed unevenly, and consequently we must mainstream this issue in all European policy areas. It is unacceptable that as much as 70% of the water supplied to our communities may be lost through leakage due to the poor state of repair of our water systems. We must reach the target of a green economy and equip ourselves with locally developed water plans that strictly combat waste and encourage water saving, reuse and recycling, whether for irrigation or for domestic use, and across all sectors of the economy.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the amendments to the regulation on the recovery of bluefin tuna stocks because, as acknowledged by the international scientific community, this is a species at risk of extinction. The figures speak for themselves: since 2009, there has been a sharp decrease in catches in all our seas. We therefore need to act swiftly in order to prevent the stock from disappearing completely. A telling example of the seriousness of the situation is the reduction in the average size of tuna fish, a phenomenon which is strikingly obvious in the Adriatic Sea, my region. We must urgently set up closed areas and sanctuaries for bluefin tuna where fishing is banned to allow stocks to recover. We need to step up controls, since illegal fishing in all European seas is still too widespread and too frequent. The envisaged measures, such as the seizure of illegal vessels and gear, must go hand in hand with effective, efficient controls, carried out by an appropriate number of employees. Lastly, it is essential to raise the minimum weight of tuna fish that may be caught, currently just 30 kilograms, and ban fishing during the spawning season. In order to save bluefin tuna we can, and must, do more. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Gerbrandy on an excellent report. The transition to a resource-efficient economy is inevitable and necessary. In 2050, the global population will reach 9 billion people and each of them will strive for a better life. As indicated by the Commission, at the current rate of resource use, in 2050, the equivalent of two Earths will be needed to sustain the world’s population. The case for ensuring each and every European policy is resource-efficient is therefore also economic. Member States must remove all obstacles to the market in waste recycling and reuse and provide economic incentives to promote innovative technologies for the collection and separation of waste. It is right to get to zero waste by banning landfill and phasing out the incineration of recyclables. We have to agree on indicators for resource use in economic activity, in other words, our footprint on the planet, our water footprint, our materials footprint and our carbon footprint. These indicators have to be used to promote legislative initiatives for sustainable development and less use of resources. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regional airports are important for improving Europe’s links and allowing its citizens to move around inside the Union, but these structures must be built and operated according to the European Union’s own environmental standards. We cannot allow air traffic, and with it regional airports, to further harm the European environment, our air quality and the well-being of our region. In northern Italy, for example – I am thinking of the cities of Treviso and Verona – the airport structures have been expanded in recent years without due consideration for the contexts in which these airports operate on a daily basis. More air connections in Europe are fine, but not at the cost of Europe’s environment, air and land. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against climate change is necessary for the survival of the planet. It is absolutely critical that Europe and all stakeholders strive to limit the increase in average temperatures to 2 °C. This is the only way that we can lower the risk of natural disasters, and consequent migration and population displacement. It is acknowledged at international level that it is certainly the poor who suffer the most. Well, 70% of the world’s poorest are women. In the developing world, it is women who play a crucial role in the abstraction and practical management of water, not just in the home but also in farming, and it is women who today have to work more owing to droughts and water shortages resulting precisely from climate change. This is why gender perspectives must be mainstreamed into all stages of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiation process, in order to effectively improve the welfare of women around the world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to what might soon be happening in one of Italy’s finest forests, the Cansiglio, located between the Veneto and Friuli regions. This is an area of great natural importance, part of the Natura 2000 network. It is here in this forest, once protected by the Most Serene Republic of Venice, that for the first time – after a ban that has lasted for centuries – hundreds of deer will be hunted, under proposals from the provinces of Treviso and Belluno and the Veneto and Friuli regional administrations. Pregnant does, on the point of delivery, will also be brutally killed, as set out in the culling plans. Under the pretext of overpopulation, disputed by the Worldwide Fund for Nature and many other associations, the Italian authorities are giving the green light to these killings. The EU must more effectively ensure compliance with directives protecting biodiversity, providing appropriate sanctions for any local administrations that violate them. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 215 million children worldwide used as child labour, 152 million child workers under the age of 15, 115 million children involved in dangerous activities – these are shocking figures that we can no longer tolerate. I voted in favour of the resolution on child labour in the cocoa sector, with absolute conviction, because the European Union has to play a fundamental role in stopping this form of modern slavery. The Commission must do its utmost to include effective provisions that will guarantee dignified employment and prevent forced child labour in all trade agreements with cocoa producing countries such as Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. We need a traceability mechanism to identify goods produced using child labour. The European Union has always defended the rights of the world’s most vulnerable people, and children working in the harvesting of cocoa beans deserve our full attention. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, one of the most important issues highlighted by the European Union Growth Survey 2012 is the serious need for new and stronger social and employment policies, especially for young people. A country with a high level of youth unemployment is a country destined to perish. In my country, Italy, the statistics are frightening. According to Eurostat data for November 2011, the youth unemployment rate is 30.1%. Young people who are often highly qualified with plenty of energy and motivation are allowed to wither away by a system where gerontocracy has become the norm. The Commission’s commitment in allocating EUR 82 billion from unused Structural Funds to stimulate growth and youth unemployment is a good step that needs to be made in the right direction. Investing in young people means investing in the future. Guaranteeing work for young Europeans means guaranteeing a future for us all. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Madam President, I should like to draw the attention of the Chamber and of European citizens to what has been going on for months in Ukraine. Since it was decided to hold the Euro 2012 football championship in Poland and Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities have, in order to stage a quick clean-up of their cities, unleashed a savage cull of stray dogs. These poor animals, including mothers and puppies, are being killed in their thousands by poisoning, clubbing and shooting, while even mobile crematory ovens are being used for this purpose. This terrible news has been broadcast around the world. On the Internet, one can see images of these acts of horrifying violence, which have been denounced and documented by reporters and local animal-protection societies. In view of the special relations that we have with this country, I call upon the European institutions to make urgent representations to the Ukrainian authorities to stop this uncivilised and barbaric massacre.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is clear from the numerous waste-related petitions received by Parliament from citizens: EU management of waste in Europe is not going well. There are too many citizens who even now, in 2012, are paying for the consequences of poor waste management in terms of their daily lives and their health, incinerators and landfills being cases in point. All the same, virtuous examples of ecologically sustainable waste management in the EU do exist. We must therefore do all we can to reach a point of total recycling, where waste actually becomes a genuine resource. This is already a reality today. There are treatment plants that recycle nearly 100% of urban waste, as in the case of the Vedelago waste centre in the province of Treviso, whose technology is exported throughout Europe. Nevertheless, we need more controls, prevention and, above all, responsible choices. We should recycle, recover and reduce waste and say ‘no’ to huge incinerators and landfills that are often the cause of air and aquifer pollution. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the resolution on the forthcoming international United Nations conference in Durban because I think that the climate change challenges posed by global warming require, more than ever, extremely strong commitment from Europe. Climate upheaval due to overheating is shown by irrefutable scientific proof and the consequent environmental, human and economic damage is now quite clear to everyone. This situation requires us to take fast, courageous decisions. Europe must retain a leading role in the fight against global overheating, committing to provide aid to other countries in terms of technology and resources. These financial resources must also be recovered through an international ‘Tobin tax’ on financial transactions. The Durban conference must lead to a legally binding international agreement with tangible outcomes for the fight against global warming. Above all, it must produce a clear calendar with deadlines and precise commitments for all countries of the world. All countries must finally put collective interests above their own individual interests because either we make an effort, or we will all pay a very hefty price. These are tough, extremely important and essential decisions, because there is no plan B any more. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, protecting bees means protecting all pollinating insects, agriculture, the environment and the ecosystem. I have abstained from voting on the resolution of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development because it is incomplete and not effective enough. The use of neonicotinoid pesticides to treat maize seeds in agriculture has led to the destruction of millions of bees. In Italy, we have experienced losses of between 30% and 70% of hives, causing serious damage to beekeepers, bees and the environment. In the two years that Italy has prohibited the use of these pesticides, two important results have come about: the bee population has recovered, and it has been demonstrated that maize production has not diminished without the use of pesticides. Today’s resolution has been a missed opportunity to call for the banishment across Europe of neonicotinoid pesticides. Europe should undertake to defend this most important natural asset on a wider scale and with greater conviction. Albert Einstein said, ‘If all the bees died, man would have four years to live’.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the continent of Europe is extremely rich in fresh water but risks becoming poor in drinking water. This is a paradox caused by the rising number of cases of water table pollution. In my region of Veneto, in Italy, for example, authorisation has been given over the last 50 years for quarrying below the water table and landfill sites that have resulted in serious pollution of the water table, groundwater and wells for drinking water. In May of this year, the Veneto Regional Environmental Protection Agency found mercury poisoning in over 100 wells located in various municipalities in the province of Treviso. Therefore, we need to take prompt action to immediately unlock the crucial Soil Directive, which was adopted at first reading by the European Parliament in 2007 but has remained blocked by the Council. The directive makes it mandatory to register and reclaim contaminated sites, which would solve the problem of water table pollution. Andrea Zanoni  (ALDE

Mr President, the hunting season opens in many European countries in September, and people begin to shoot millions of wild animals in the name of an anachronistic activity which can no longer be justified. Despite the protection laid down by European laws, in certain countries, such as Italy, some local authorities allow exceptional hunting, namely the hunting of protected birds such as chaffinches or meadow pipits, just to pander to the hunters’ lobby and secure their votes. The Veneto and Lombardy regions have recently approved exceptional hunting again, demonstrating contempt and indifference, not least towards the European Court of Justice and its very recent judgments on this subject. Europe needs stricter rules. In order to protect wild animals we have to put an end to this barbarian medieval practice. We need to put an immediate stop to these illegal rules in these regions.

Madam President, there are two aspects to the measure that we have adopted, one geopolitical and the other environmental. Geopolitically the introduction of shale gas extraction could have a positive effect for Europe, since it might reduce our dependence on Iranian and Russian resources, but there are strong environmental concerns. This apparently harmless gas may have a severe impact on the environment, on nature and on the coming generations. The resolution we have adopted therefore takes a cautious approach and introduces a moratorium. However, we will have to return to the question to assess the environmental effects.

 Madam President, with this report Parliament is recognising how quickly the consumer credit market is changing. The financial crisis is also a credit crisis and the massive reduction in loans granted to families affects businesses and the whole economy. If the Commission could intervene to increase access to cross-border credit, which is currently too low, accounting for only 2 % of total credit in the EU, many Europeans who are currently unable to obtain loans in their own countries because of the economic problems of those countries could obtain them in other Member States, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of the single market for which the European institutions are fighting so hard to overcome national boundaries.

 Madam President, I am expressing my opinion and my vote in favour of the matter under discussion because the burgeoning of means of payment and the widespread use of ‘e-money’ demand rules that reflect the times and that reconcile the drive towards greater openness to the internal market with the need for transparency. There are some positive aspects to this, which have an impact on the fight against laundering money from unlawful activities and on tax evasion, which is an unfortunate feature of many Member States. However, we need to look at this in greater detail. I think it is essential that we understand the potential problems that multilateral interchange fees could cause as regards competitiveness, with costs and surcharges that discourage greater use of e-money, and some hidden interchange fees that could do the opposite of making for an open, competitive and transparent market system.

 – Madam President, I voted in favour of the Costa report against the wishes of my group, and I wanted to explain why this was. I believe the report covers most aspects of the fight against threats to children from the digital world. Protecting children is an urgent matter in a changing technological world, where family, schools and the education system are not always taking the necessary measures to prevent its harmful effects. There is plenty to do, but it was the positive aspects of this report that made me vote for it. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of the text adopted today, which stems from the Commission Communication of 2011 on Social Business Initiative. The Europe 2020 strategy lies ahead, and with it we will need to provide answers to the ever-increasing need for social services, for example in the health and nursing sectors, and to estimate the demographic trend we have to deal with. However, this must be accompanied by a high degree of innovation and experimentation, the success or failure of which is a matter for the European institutions to evaluate within a set timescale, so we can see whether this initial approach could bring about improvements and can continue to develop this type of enterprise effectively in the longer term. We need to bear in mind that the nature of this type of business is very specific, having to reconcile economic growth with solidarity. For this reason I voted in favour, so that this constructive approach can be a basic pillar of a new society that reclaims the meaning and value of a job where humans are central to society in a new, integrated kind of humanism.

 As rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I actively assisted in drafting the macro-regional strategy for the Mediterranean. I see it as a territorial cooperation tool that will achieve greater synergy between the various intervention instruments through multi-level governance. In this respect, the strategy for the Mediterranean may hinge on the need to develop an integrated maritime transport system covering the whole Mediterranean basin and the development of renewable energy. A fundamental issue that I have worked for in this dossier is to address the island question at a European level and to ask the EU institutions to implement Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union by adopting an ad hoc
 strategy that takes account of the handicaps faced by islands. Another feature of the dossier is the provision that the Commission, in collaboration with the forthcoming Cypriot Presidency of the EU, will adopt a strategic plan for islands that creates the conditions for economic growth in these territories while ensuring their full territorial continuity. A particularly significant point is the call for the Commission to adopt measures, such as increasing the threshold for de minimis
 aid for islands in the transport, agriculture and fishery sectors, which will make the islands equally competitive with the mainland territories. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Mr President, I, together with the Italian Italia dei Valori
 delegation, have backed the introduction of the Tobin tax, a financial speculation tax, since 2010. Today, Parliament voted in favour of introducing this tax, which we believe to be an essential tool to ensure that the financial sector assumes its responsibilities and is steered back towards the real economy. As far as we are concerned, the introduction of a European financial transaction tax (FTT) reasserts the supremacy of democratic politics over the serious discrepancies in the functioning of the financial markets, which caused the economic crisis we are experiencing today. The FTT does away with the exemption from tax on financial transactions and makes financial speculators responsible in the same way as ordinary citizens, who have to pay taxes even on bread and petrol on a daily basis. With expected revenues of over EUR 50 billion a year, the European Parliament is today sending a signal that it is taking responsibility, in order to create more solidarity in the world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I voted in favour of the own-initiative report on regional airports, and I am sure it will serve as a basis for their further regulation. This report shows the importance that the European Parliament attributes to these airports in the context of air transport and the important role that they play as a vehicle for territorial, economic and social cohesion within the European Union. For the first time, the definition of a regional airport has been provided and an attempt has been made to limit the area of reference by sub-dividing regional airports into major and minor airports, also in relation to passenger throughput and the links provided by such airports. It is certainly to be hoped that the Commission will then follow up with more stringent specifications for their definition. A special passage concerns recognition of the need to guarantee public service obligations for remote regions, islands and the outermost regions, as we are well aware of their handicap in terms of participation in the single market. Finally, I believe that the definition establishing and specifying the negative view of the irrational proliferation of further regional airports is useful. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal to amend the provisions on risk-sharing instruments is extremely timely for those Member States at risk of suffering great difficulties as a result of the current financial instability. Its arrival during this period of serious economic crisis is perfect. Hence, in this amendment to the regulation on risk-sharing instruments, countries such as Ireland, Portugal, Hungary, Romania, Lithuania and above all Greece will find an alternative to the threat of losing funds already assigned and therefore the chance to carry on with programmes cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund that are proving difficult to implement in these Member States. This will result in the projects being carried out and jobs being retained across the parts of the European Union most affected by the economic crisis, without eating into the EU’s budget in any way but instead making a major contribution to growth in Europe.

 I voted in favour of Mr Taylor’s own-initiative report because it calls on the Commission to intervene both to enforce existing legislation and to promote and simplify the use of the instruments that protect air passenger rights. This report emphasises the legal certainty of passengers’ rights, their right to information, and the independence and operational transparency of the independent enforcement bodies that can impose penalties for infringements and resolve disputes between passengers and the industry. All too often, passengers find that they are the victims of the abusive practices of air carriers, which take advantage of passengers’ lack of information about their own rights in order to delay or cancel flights arbitrarily without accepting the liability that they should accept by law. I hope, therefore, that this report can provide useful suggestions for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, which is expected to take place next year.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a picture of Rossella Urru, the young Sardinian woman kidnapped in Algeria on 23 October along with two Spanish colleagues during a cooperation mission to help the poorest inhabitants of the Maghreb. Rossella is a young woman who has dedicated her life to a noble occupation, namely helping people in need. The young woman’s family, the Italian nation, and all of us eagerly await her release and the release of all European citizens who are hostages or have been abducted. Rossella is a young European citizen, a standard-bearer of our values, and that is why she must return home. That is why I am calling for the foreign service and our High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, to redouble their diplomatic efforts to ensure that Rossella can regain her freedom and return home.

 Mr President, the milk and milk products sector has been undergoing a terrible crisis for some years now, but there are internal imbalances that this report and its amendment – which I supported from the start – will determine to a lesser extent, by influencing how it works and putting an end to these internal imbalances, or at least remedying them in part together with other instruments. This measure has been produced by the working group set up by Mr Cioloş, which produced some instruments for restoring balance to the added value for all operators in the supply chain. In specific terms, the terms and conditions of contracts will have determined characteristics of form, requirements and duration, which will mainly be useful to producers. One important element will concern raw milk processed in less favoured areas (LFAs), mountainous areas, intermediate areas and islands, where any transfer of milk from areas which are not LFAs must be authorised in advance.

 Madam President, I voted for the report by Mr Fleckenstein because I am fully convinced that an Agency as important as the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) must have a regulation that specifies clear, precise duties, and highlights the effective division of tasks between EMSA, the European Commission and the Member States. All too often we are witness to accidents that pollute our seas, which are under constant threat also from the rise in the transport of dangerous goods and materials by sea, often in maritime areas protected by special rules due to their naturalistic importance, such as the Bocche di Bonifacio. In this regard, I particularly appreciated the rapporteur’s focus on development of the CleanSeaNet service and the SaveSeaNet network. The text was very balanced despite being multi-faceted, recognising the need to define EMSA’s tasks also by taking on more staff, without putting too much pressure on the budget, and underlining the importance of innovative tools such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme (GMES), while also launching a positive message on support in the sector for gender equality policies.

 Madam President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Grosch on a Single European Transport Area, and would like to thank him for his work. I would particularly like to thank him for the welcome references to the new guidelines on the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), which will animate the future legal debate, and for recognising the value of innovative instruments such as Galileo, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and Global Monitoring for Environment and Safety (GMES.) However, I am sorry that some aspects of fundamental importance in creation of a real Single European Transport Area were not adequately explored. More specifically, the insular nature of many European countries has not been investigated in sufficient detail, particularly with regard to the regulations that apply to them in terms of their obligations to provide public transport, which are currently muddled and difficult to describe as far as the various modes of transport are concerned. Lastly, I found the text did not sufficiently cover the issue of transporting hazardous goods, which needs to be properly dealt with and regulated, both in order to avoid terrible accidents, and in order to manage accidents once they have happened, including in terms of the liability of the entities involved, institutions or otherwise.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was among those who signed the alternative resolution on the health of honeybees, because the report put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) completely rejected the recommendations indicated in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) opinion, for which I was a shadow rapporteur. The plague inflicted upon bees is a problem which is becoming more and more serious, and there is plenty of scientific confirmation to show the damage caused by pesticides and monocultures. In order to understand this, we only have to think of areas of the world, for instance certain valleys in China, where pollination is now carried out by hand precisely as a result of uninhibited overuse of particular types of pesticides over time. Yet, the report approved today by the European Parliament has not taken a stance on this topic. We lack a critical objective on the toxicity of pesticides, specifically, the prohibition of systematic neurotoxins; we lack indications for the beekeeping sector relating to contamination of honey produce by GMO crops; we lack a critique on monoculture; and we lack the idea that large-scale changes are required in agriculture, including crop rotation, to reduce the use of pesticides, with a view to reversing the sharp decline in the production of pollinators.

 Mr President, in order to evaluate the report adopted today, we need to start by extrapolating two fundamental facts: the fact that the number of dependent people with disabilities will supposedly double by 2050, and the fact that, at the moment, we do not have a sufficient amount of data to gauge the severity of the problem. The challenge being addressed by means of this Disability Strategy 2010-2020 is to allow people with disabilities not only to enjoy human rights, just like everyone else, but also to ensure that those rights can be put into practice effectively. It is therefore essential to bring out disabled people’s full potential by encouraging them to train, providing them with freedom of movement and enabling them to access the labour market: by so doing, we will also be able to combat one of the biggest problems that adds to the misfortune of these people, namely, poverty.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the Green Paper on the modernisation of public procurement policy for two reasons in particular. Firstly, identification of the most economically advantageous tender which takes into account the entire life-cycle costs of the relevant goods, works or services and therefore not just the lowest price – a common, widespread consideration in all countries and all contracting authorities – which will improve quality, and, at the same time, place greater emphasis on the environmental and social sustainability of goods and services. Secondly, simplification, which will be achieved through greater flexibility, and which will allow for simpler procedures and offer small and medium-sized enterprises greater opportunities in the awarding of contracts. I would add, in particular, that in this regard, we should promote electronic procurement, which currently accounts for less than five per cent of all public procurement in the EU, and that the publication of calls for tender, divided into lots, will enable greater transparency when it comes to participation in tenders.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the whole package of six measures, this one therefore included, because they represent a fundamental transition towards true European governance. We are doing this in order to take responsibility and bring budgets under control, even where national governments, the governments of Member States, have failed to do so. This is, moreover, the moment at which the credibility of our institutions, of European institutions, is at stake. Europe is taking upon itself the duty of making its citizens’ demands its own and of securing that stability, that government in order to create the conditions for growth, without which there would not have been and could not now be a future for our citizens and especially for new generations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Ms Goulard on having tackled and completed such a difficult text: it too is a fundamental step in the direction of European governance. It is also a practical move on the part of Parliament to take forward the statements we have heard again today in plenary, but which are often not acted on. This is the specific call, I repeat, that we are also making to President Barroso, because everyone agrees when a statement of principle is made. There was agreement when the Commission’s programme was adopted in this House, but it needs to be implemented. This report is a specific step towards the implementation of that programme.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Haglund again here on the work he has done. I voted in favour of it, and in fact I welcome the entire package. The report introduces penalties for macroeconomic imbalances, but it should be said that those penalties are to be imposed only if Member States demonstrate an unwillingness to adopt the necessary corrective policies, because, if the finance situation does not improve, Mr De Angelis, there can be no prospect of growth, or no prospect of satisfactory and meaningful growth, anyway. For that reason I believe that the package that has been adopted today will serve as a basis for the growth that the Member States as a whole must in fact aim for. If we stop here, we will definitely not have achieved the objectives that we are setting ourselves, but in taking this step we will certainly be able to achieve that other objective. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation that we have adopted on the prevention of macroeconomic imbalances among the 27 countries is certainly a departure from the previous situation. It establishes rules and checks and, in particular, it introduces the concept of symmetry, which means that the Commission must assess not only deficits, but also surpluses. In practice, contrary to the commonly held view that there a few bad countries, such as Greece or Italy, countries such as Germany and the Netherlands are also being placed under supervision due to their overly low levels of domestic consumption. Furthermore, the regulation has an essentially federalist outlook and hence stresses the notion of fairness, which we believe is one of the positive elements that characterise the future of Europe and of the Member States – fairness and solidarity, which will be the preconditions for European growth.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out, now that we have reached the conclusion a year after the proposal was first tabled, that the Feio report reviews the Stability and Growth Pact and hence finally establishes a check requiring States with a debt/GDP ratio of more than 60% to achieve a 5% reduction. It does so by laying down and clarifying the debt criterion and the procedures on the pace that has to be followed. The Commission will have to consider a range of factors in this global economic context before assessing and making its recommendations to the Member State concerned. The report introduces the fundamental principle that reducing one’s debt means paying less interest and therefore being able to spend more on investment and growth, which is the real objective on which we will have to focus over the next few months.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, more than a year ago now, when the initial problems in the Greek economy, and then in the economies of other countries, began to emerge, I was interviewed by the European channel. One of the points I raised was precisely the attention paid to the statistical data that allowed some countries to fiddle their accounts. The Ford report, which we have voted on and approved today, by contrast lays down criteria on the transparency and independence of national statistical authorities, with penalties for those who commit forgery and fraud. It is a fundamental report, in that it aims to prevent a lack of transparency in the compilation of statistical data and ensures that those data are uniform. This will enable the European institutions and the governments of all the countries to proceed uniformly, in other words to have criteria that are not only based on knowledge but which are also uniform in terms of the actions carried out.

 Madam President, Commissioner Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased, and first of all, therefore, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Gardini, and the shadow rapporteurs for their fruitful collaboration on such a highly topical and extremely important dossier as this. As I was saying, we are pleased with the balanced, rational approach adopted in the report, which perfectly takes account of the principle of subsidiarity and the idea of a solidarity clause, which should guide the Member States’ actions in their response to disasters and in their civil protection role. Specifically, I believe it is necessary to develop a predictable, pre-planned system within the European Union’s Civil Protection Mechanism that is in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity. In other words, it must not involve setting up a supranational body, which would be liable to duplicate costs and powers without any assurance that it would work efficiently. I particularly welcome the attention devoted to extremely vulnerable areas such as islands, which is clearly expressed throughout the body of the report, as well as the emphasis on the link between disaster preparation, prevention and response, which make up an inseparable trio. Lastly, I am pleased to see how sensitively other Members have addressed the subject of major regional threats, which I believe deserves our attention; in particular, there have been many references to actions and strategies targeting forest fires.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted overall in favour of Mr Koch’s report because I agree with its targeted approach inasmuch as it asks the Commission for a concrete, circumstantiated commitment to road safety, including the development of the proposed models into a fully-fledged new action plan. The plan must incorporate a set of detailed measures, with clear timetables and monitoring instruments to assess the progress made, as well as a mid-term review. Conversely, I did not wish to support the idea of appointing an EU road safety coordinator, which, in my view, would be likely to duplicate powers and generate an excessively bureaucratic mechanism. Of course, it seems obvious that achieving the target of halving road accident victims by 2020 would also require a financial commitment that currently appears to be difficult to achieve. In conclusion, however, I regret the fact that the Committee on Transport and Tourism was not bold or ambitious enough to accept a complete harmonisation of important road safety rules, such as standardising the EU direction of travel in the United Kingdom and Malta as well, as I proposed in an amendment which the committee chose not to accept.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe I wish to express my satisfaction with the work that has been carried out. It is an historic step in the institutional evolution of Europe following the Treaty of Lisbon that for the first time competences are assigned to Parliament and the Commission in relation to tourism, which is the third component of the economy and of employment in Europe. First of all, I would like to stress that the text that is being put to the House today sets out a comprehensive governance that stems from Europe 2020 strategy and develops a series of proposals to achieve growth that is smart, sustainable and inclusive in every sense. Accordingly, it suggests specific programming instruments such as strategies for macro-regions, interregionality and joint and complementary planning. At times like these, when governance loses its bearings, we know what the negative effects are. Here, on the other hand, the dossier traces a very precise path. Out of these plans and instruments, I wish to call to mind the extraordinary plan to foster a progressive reduction in the seasonal nature of tourism, set out in paragraph 63 of the report. From the point of view of a European economy that, unfortunately, is losing a large share of industrial output, tourism can and must represent an important factor for overall growth, above all if the main public and private players can create an integrated approach between the different policies of the sector, the various financial instruments and build tourism into a real system that brings together the various economic sectors: agriculture, industry, craft, transport, services, and so on. I should mention that the text being voted upon contains numerous references to islands and remote areas which represent, as I was saying at the outset, a tangible way of achieving, through appropriate financial instruments, the criterion of inclusion sought by Europe 2020 strategy. Ladies and gentlemen, the tourism sector is also characterised by sustainable growth in environmental and social terms, which supports SMEs for which we have provided a business incubator tool, for innovation by way of supplying knowledge tools that will enable them to achieve, and the tourist to obtain, better travel solutions. Further, beyond the specific actions already put forward by the Commission I must give credit to Commissioner Tajani for the particular attention paid to SMEs and micro-enterprises, which must be singled out. In the report, they are regarded as guaranteeing innovation from the bottom up and they are expressly recognised as fulfilling the function of ensuring the quality, variety and authenticity of the different regions. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the compromise reached between Parliament and the European Council, European consumers will now be able to know where the meat on their table comes from. My amendment, which is taken up in the institutional compromise, was undoubtedly more ambitious and required more extensive marking of the origin and provenance of other products too – not just of meat, but of milk, dairy products in general and meat used as an ingredient in food. Nevertheless, it is satisfying to know that a road map has been established that will see the Commission present a specific report on this issue in two and three years’ time. The report will therefore include proposals to ensure the increased – not to say full – protection of all Europeans in the near future. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on which we voted today regarding European Union legislation on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, known as ‘mad cow disease’, testifies to the excellence of the European policies that have been adopted to protect human and animal health. The number of cases has certainly diminished in recent years, and this enables us to apply less alarming countermeasures, hence, for example, where a case appears in a herd, it is now possible to avoid culling the entire herd, but to use the milk produced until it is fully depleted. We all remember with great concern the images of entire herds slaughtered if one animal had contracted the disease, and that is something that we shall now avoid. We must, however, continue to be vigilant, Madam President, because the text we have adopted today introduces a considerable risk to health and opens the way to free use of animal meal. In this regard, we must remain vigilant. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Lepage for her determined work in bringing this dossier to a positive conclusion. I have been a staunch supporter of this report throughout, partly because I think it gives real legal value to the text we have adopted and also because it fills a legislative vacuum that has given rise to serious legal dispute between enterprises, public bodies and citizens. This measure avoids the colonisation of the Member States, leaving them free to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of genetically modified organisms. The amendments that this text brings in will therefore allow the individual Member States to ban the cultivation of GMOs due to the impact they may have on the agricultural system, particularly with regard to biodiversity, but also with regard to pesticide resistance, to the invasiveness of certain crops and, therefore, to the protection of our territories. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, the report by Mr Pieper on the post-2013 cohesion policy reduces the effects of a two-speed Europe. Indeed, only uniform growth can ensure proper cohesion between our territories and overall unity, even in diversity. I voted in favour of the text because it introduces an intermediate category, which allows may European regions to continue to benefit from the same amount of structural funds as they have done so far. The lack of efficient programming for the use of European funds has unfortunately resulted in many regions being unable to make proper use of the resources made available by the European Union, thereby risking a majority of the funds being left unused. Here, however, Brussels is sending out a positive message. We hope that our regions will know how to interpret and use the funds in the best possible way. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE
),

I voted in favour of the identification of new parameters more representative of a country’s progress, and not just its consumption, although I think more should be done. The report in question has had a long and difficult journey, and finally made it to the plenary session having lost much of its content along the way. Parliament should have put forward a proposal taking into account factors including education, health and personal activities, but it confined itself to highlighting the need to establish new parameters, delegating the task of defining them to the Commission. Gross domestic product is an outdated indicator based on economic principles that, by reducing quality to quantity, overlook the meaning of things and individual and collective well-being, undervalue work in itself compared to the object of production, and consider only the production of new objects, not maintenance.

Mr President, as shadow rapporteur of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am completely satisfied with the outcome of today’s vote. The report by Mr Arsenis on the protection of forests is a policy report; it is a basis for confirming how the European Parliament intends to tackle the protection of our forest heritage and the adaptation of forests to climate change. Today, the European Parliament clearly expressed its point of view, in the light of which we expect the Commission to make the necessary proposals and so enable even more detailed policies to be drafted for the sector. I would particularly like to thank Mr Arsenis for his expert and professional work, which involved a long and difficult debate, because – as we are well aware – the forest situation is not the same in all the Member States. Despite this, we found common ground and also achieved some specific objectives, for example, the protection of certain parts from land speculation, greater protection of forests which are prized for their biodiversity, such as the northern Boreal and Mediterranean forests, and a ban on building on land cleared by arson. Mr President, as I have said, this is very important for many Mediterranean countries, including your own country, Greece. Giommaria Uggias,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has endorsed my recommendation for discharge to be granted to the European transport agencies, which support the European Commission. The discharge is granted because the Court of Auditors deemed that the annual accounts of the agencies were substantially reliable, although we must take note of and underscore a number of critical issues. Some of these issues are common to all the agencies or some of them, including for example: cancellations and delays in procurement procedures, failure to observe Staff Regulations, or the violation of the principle of budgetary annuality. These agencies’ commitment to overcome said problems should, however, be highlighted. In general terms, I should like to make two brief political observations, namely the lack of any multiannual programming – which is symptomatic of a leadership deficit – and the dearth of incisiveness in the work of some agencies, such as the European Railway Agency. In the same vein, I should like to note the delay – some two years after the fact – in setting up procedures to determine responsibility for the Viareggio disaster. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are taking a step forward in understanding that this is not a problem linked to some areas of Europe, Southern Europe or North Africa. However, my view of the measure is a positive one. I would like to ask Mr Tarabella whether he or the Commission does not think that the problem of application to veterinary services should also be tackled immediately, so that there could be a measure which would make it possible to eliminate the problem throughout the European Union. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important measure for the agricultural world. However, the measure needs to be followed up immediately by a commitment from the Council and national governments to adopt it forthwith, before the end of the season, in order to solve this problem which does not affect just the southern part of Europe, but the whole of Europe, as today’s vote has shown. Bluetongue affects the sheep and cattle on our farms. Therefore, taking action to totally eradicate it is a health policy objective which national governments can best contribute to through this measure by being flexible. It also needs to be immediately adopted through transposition of the directive. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian delegation from Italia dei Valori 
voted against the text of the resolution on nuclear power, because it was not clear enough to indicate a clear no to nuclear power. Unfortunately, all the amendments that could have improved the text and chosen a Europe free of nuclear power, immediately free of existing nuclear power stations and with no future nuclear power stations, were rejected. A Europe free of nuclear power is the only possible route if we want to guarantee that our children and future generations will have a future protected from the repetition of catastrophes like Fukushima and Chernobyl. These lessons tell us that there is no such thing as theoretical safety. That is why we have to say a clear no to the nuclear option and invest in research and innovation in other sources that are truly green, renewable and clean. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I worked as shadow rapporteur on this dossier and so could not but vote in favour, together with my group. I did so believing it to be a very useful tool for the development of a sector that will be a driving force for the European economy. Industry is moving away from Europe; agriculture suffers from serious deficiencies; meanwhile, tourism is one area that can certainly offer prospects for employment, economic development and intelligent, inclusive and compatible growth. To this end, the instrument we have approved today, which allows for more modern data gathering, processing, treatment and transmission than the previous situation, will surely give impetus to this activity. This is why the ALDE Group and I have voted in favour. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measure we have voted on today is of some help in clarifying the phenomenon of migration flows and praises the work of Frontex. I think this should be seen positively and therefore so should the result of the vote. I do, however, believe that this stance should be accompanied by equal clarity on the part of the Member States, because this challenge affects not only the European Institutions but also policy in the Member States. I must say, however, that so far not all Member States have implemented and practiced such clarity, starting with the policy of the Italian Government, which has dealt with the situation in Lampedusa in a most objectionable and questionable manner. Thousands of migrants there have been essentially abandoned to their fate, whilst human solidarity – never mind legal solidarity – would have led to immediate care and certainly greater respect than has been shown, notwithstanding the fact that the legal problem would then have to be dealt with, as we have done in this House.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a staunch supporter of the anti-nuclear cause I backed this report not only because I think the decommissioning of these plants is of benefit to all, but also because I hope that no more will be able to be built. Today we are faced with a ticking time-bomb across Europe. The operation of nuclear power plants for civilian purposes is founded on engineering practices which are now outdated and anachronistic. It can be said that their safety is ever more theoretical: everything will be fine, as long as nothing happens. In fact, we are dealing with protocols from 50 years ago which, in reality, are not protected against events that may be increasingly unforeseeable. Terrorist attacks could not have been foreseen and nor could the natural and disastrous events – not only earthquakes – which unfortunately are increasingly frequent in our disaster-stricken world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the committee Chair, Brian Simpson, for leading the work of the committee and work on the file, and, above all, for having allowed its conclusion – at least I hope so because the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) will be voting for this – and approval on first reading, and hence the successful conclusion of the regulation. This task actually involves reviewing the regulation, which sets out to establish a common framework for the collection of statistics on tourism and, more specifically, for all its stages, ranging from the collection to the processing, treatment and transmission of statistics, enabling optimum knowledge of the financial world that is activated and revolves around tourism. Mr President, it is clear that, since the 1995 directive, which is the predecessor of this directive, remarkable growth has been recorded in tourism and we must acknowledge, in particular, the great prospects that the economic system of tourism will contribute to the European economy as a whole in the near future. I worked on the file as a shadow rapporteur for the ALDE Group and, as I said earlier, we are going to vote in favour of it. I think the Simpson report will be particularly popular due to the notion of tourism satellite accounts, namely, the adoption of pilot projects that will make it possible to assess the economic impact on individual sectors of the economy, in other words, aspects relating to same-day visits, the evaluation report to be drawn up every five years and the possibility, indeed the necessity, of a five-yearly report to assess the effects of statistics. I will conclude by saying that this is part of the new responsibility arising out of the Treaty of Lisbon and I think this time, we are beginning to assume the responsibilities of Parliament effectively and we will do the same with the next file being worked on, soon to arrive in this Chamber.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we were delighted to adopt the measures proposed by Mrs Podimata. For those of us in the Italian delegation of the Italia dei Valori
 party within the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, this was a moment of great satisfaction, because it shows that Parliament knows how to follow up its statements of principle. In fact, as early as the debate on the report by Mrs Berès on the financial, economic and social crisis, we had argued in favour of a tax on financial transactions. This was done today, so we are delighted to declare that we voted in favour because this tax will shift financial resources from the financial economy – and therefore away from financial speculation – to the real economy. The tax will also respond to the Millennium Development Goals and contribute to large European projects in infrastructure, research, ecological restructuring and in our system of production.

 Mr President, the resolution adopted today has established important principles for the protection of consumers, increasing safeguards against the spread of falsified medicinal products. This is an extremely dangerous phenomenon, and one of the most significant remedies has been to stem the online sale of medicines of dubious origin. Moreover, through the adoption of a number of guarantees, we will establish strict regulations that require permits and inspections. This does not, however, mean that forms of health protection and medical prescriptions are cancelled out. It must be remembered that the legislative power of Member States is unaffected in this respect and that they may retain or limit the ban on the online sales of drugs within their territory. This is an opportunity for Member States to better regulate the matter, but we must remember, Mr President, that citizens can order medicines from another Member State and that this regulation should not be seen as another opportunity to benefit the pharmaceutical industry. Instead we must continue to progress along the trail of liberalisation that the EU is currently blazing by adopting measures such as this. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Cancian on his excellent work in bringing this measure to its conclusion. Mr Mastella will allow me to disagree with him on the idea that this measure represents a great victory for our citizens. One cannot but note that citizens are only protected if they travel further than 250 km by coach or bus. Where is the protection for the rights of citizens of Europe if – as Mrs Meissner has already stressed – entire States such as Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are excluded from this protection? These are the reasons why our group abstained in the vote. We did not vote against the report because some rights are protected, such as those of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. That is why we abstained. As for the rest of it, we would ask to return to the issue as soon as possible in order to really protect our citizens. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Madam President, when, a century ago, Antonio Meucci’s patent was not recognised by the American telephony industry, it was not because of a lack of English or his use of Italian, but instead the failure to meet a condition: he did not have the money to register his patent for another year. In a similar vein, we are now in a paradoxical situation and, quite apart from the vote, I think that the fact that a trilingual patent system is to be adopted, which excludes Italian, is basically a sign of the weakness of our government, its inability to make its voice heard in European politics, and the weakness of our political system, which reflects, above all, on research and innovation. On this issue, we need only recall the competitiveness study published last December, which shows that in recent years, Italy has willingly handed over EUR 4 billion to other countries that have welcomed our researchers. These researchers certainly no longer have any need for Italian, since they have learnt English, French and German and have all the tools required to submit these patents, to the detriment of Italian products. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Madam President, I mostly support the amendments proposed through this text, which in any case essentially does nothing more than codify previous legislation regarding the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and animal feedingstuffs. We are forgetting and letting it pass somewhat unnoticed that we are talking about waste from nuclear accidents. This means that we have to continue to pay close attention to the risks of nuclear plants and to the fact that these are the consequences of the rotten and poisonous results of what, in certain States, we insist on developing. It is therefore a measure that must inspire us all to be as vigilant as possible. Getting to the heart of the matter, I do, however, think that more could be done to bring in compulsory immediate notification, which would allow all risk factors to be dealt with together. Furthermore, there should be no way to avoid the requirement to notify government authorities in the event of an accident. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we have adopted the resolution on waste in Campania, which should be a lesson to us all to prevent environmental disasters like this from happening. We can feel pleased with ourselves today, because in this plenary we have adopted a measure like this, which makes a culture of recycling and reuse at a time of globalisation a measure to be promoted and encouraged in every possible way to ensure that European citizens, who are now free from the effort of producing the goods that are now within everyone’s reach, are aware of their real value. Mr Florenz’s report on the reuse of electrical and electronic equipment, on which we are voting today, is important not only for the future of environmental sustainability in Europe, but also for another aspect: the loss of raw materials. In fact, the efficient and innovative use of materials and resources is a key issue in the globalised economy. I therefore consider it positive that we have set ourselves ambitious targets and also that the actual cost of a product should be indicated in such a way that consumers become aware of it. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent weeks, the various parliamentary committees that are dealing with the issue of the common agricultural policy have been looking into the matter of the post-2013 reform. Clearly, food security is one of the fundamental elements of agriculture. This consideration must therefore be viewed in the light of the report being put to the vote today, in which food security is defined as a fundamental right that must accordingly be safeguarded in every possible way. Such attention is required, Mr President, whenever there is an emergency, such as that linked to the dioxin scandal that we are witnessing at the moment, with the discovery that dioxin is being used in animal feed, but also, and above all, to ensure that we have a common production process that respects the production sector as a whole, that respects the quality of farmers’ work, the environment and marketing, and hence, that respects consumers. This report forms part of a set of measures that this House has developed to promote agriculture, and I can therefore say that I am satisfied. Giommaria Uggias  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market is one of the pillars of the European Union. There is no doubt that, under the same general conditions, enterprises can produce and sell their products and services without public support, but not all sectors and not all areas are operating under conditions of parity. It is therefore fair, as in this instance, to correct situations of economic disadvantage and allow productive businesses to remain on the market and maintain employment levels, as in Sulcis for example, where 500 families would have found themselves without work, without income and without dignity. We must realise that when we speak of coal, we are talking about areas that have no alternative to mines and should be allowed the opportunity to adopt production technologies that are competitive and compatible with the free market and with the environment. Logically, postponing the deadline to 2018 must represent an imperative to ensure that institutions and companies take immediate action to develop technological, financial and environmental compatibility conditions that are in line with the challenges that await us.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, 14 February, is European Epilepsy Day. This is a condition from which 6 million European citizens suffer, of whom some 300 000 are Italians. It is therefore important that associations, including the Italian Epilepsy Association, dedicated to increase awareness of such a serious condition about which there is still much ignorance, a lack of clear information and regarding which many extremely delicate aspects remain unknown, should organise meeting opportunities over this period. Some steps forward have been made in the last few years at European level, especially through a 2009 directive, but there is still much to do, especially to guarantee full civil rights to sufferers from this condition in the world of work and of mobility, and in guaranteeing the availability of medication during school hours. I therefore consider days of reflection on such fundamental aspects of these problems to be very important. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on the waste crisis in Campania, which was adopted by a majority today, is a very important sign. The emergency in Campania has become a European emergency, and that is a decision in favour of the people of Campania. We are saying ‘no’ to the disbursement of funds that are used simply to strengthen corrupt politicians, unscrupulous businessmen and organised crime; ‘yes’ to European money if a credible, environmentally friendly waste plan is put forward; ‘no’ to uncontrolled landfill in national parks; ‘no’ to dioxin-producing incinerators; and ‘yes’ to recycling and environmentally friendly methods. We are also saying ‘no’ to the criminalisation of dissent in local communities, and therefore ‘yes’ to legality. It is an important turning point and a warning to the Berlusconi Government and the regional government run by Stefano Caldoro, which so far have done nothing but talk and bolster up their cliques and the Mafia establishment. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
). 
 – (IT)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the lies told by the Berlusconi government, which assumed office in 2008 telling Italians that the waste problem had been resolved, the European Union is doing the right thing by refusing to grant Italy funding until an environmentally friendly waste system based on recycling of waste and composting has been presented. That system is certainly not provided for by Mr Caldoro’s plan, which is based once again on uncontrolled landfills such as the ones at Chiaiano, Taverna del Re and Terzigno – the Terzigno landfill is actually inside Vesuvius National Park – nor by incinerators, which cause death, cancers and full-blown health crises. In the 13 years that the environmental crisis has been going on, public funds in Campania have strengthened the criminal links between politicians, both on the left and on the right, businessmen and the Camorra. Furthermore, environmental issues are not resolved by criminalising dissent or by criminalising local communities, families and the region, as the Italian Government has done by using batons to restrain anyone who defends the environment and the land. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that if we can now talk about a reduction in errors, we owe this to the skill, independence and professionalism of the Court of Auditors, and I should like President Caldeira to take note of this. I believe that, as well as the Commission, Parliament played an important part in this improvement, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control, which sets great store by the subject of transparency and the effective and efficient use of public funds. We must still see what we can do to improve, however, because there are still too many things that are not right, particularly in very sensitive sectors such as agriculture and cohesion, with often worrying error rates in sectors where fraud in areas such as contracts and over-invoicing is rife. I believe that it is necessary to lower the rate of bureaucracy and reduce pointless red tape and instead introduce a few clear rules to send out a very clear and determined ‘no’ to every form of fraud in sectors where corruption is endemic. Another important factor is to step up the role of OLAF, the anti-fraud office, to combat all forms of fraud and corruption. Another aspect that we cannot fail to emphasise – we learned this also from a recent visit by the Committee on Budgetary control to Italy – is that there is also a risk of the forceful influence of organised crime and forms of corruption on public funds. The role of OLAF could therefore be essential from this viewpoint, together with greater cooperation between Member States, the Commission and Parliament. Another absolutely essential point is that I believe the Commission must strengthen its independence from Member States. I believe that we must block funds to prevent repetition of this type of behaviour, particularly in states where serious errors – I am not talking about minor errors – and very substantial episodes of fraud have been going on for years. The credibility level of the European Parliament and the European institutions is determined greatly by the level of transparency and correctness with which public funds are spent. I therefore believe that we have room for improvement on this score. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find President Sarkozy’s decision to be very serious: once again, in an effort to conceal internal political problems – as has already happened in Italy – he is attempting to regain support by criminalising outsiders and migrants, playing on people’s anxieties over social safety. Before Europe becomes the Europe of markets, it must be the Europe of rights, the Europe of solidarity and the Europe of inclusion. This is why President Sarkozy’s statement was immediately followed by the very serious statement by the Italian Minister for the Interior, who wishes to adopt the Sarkozy method and extend it to EU citizens, expelling them without incomes or homes. Therefore, rather than promoting inclusion policies, policies that reduce social inequalities and seek to unite people, the aim is once again to criminalise people. This is very serious because migrants, outsiders, those who are considered to be on the fringes of society are useful when they are needed, for example, for illegal work; in other words, when they have duties to perform but no rights. If an outsider, a Roma or a migrant commits a crime, he is punished, but this must not be a pretext for justifying very serious expulsions. The Commission must react if it wants a Europe of solidarity, equality and freedom. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when building a Europe of rights, an essential part is played by freedom of information, pluralism of information and independence of information. Is the Commissioner aware that there is one country in the European Union – which is incidentally a founder member of the European Union under the Treaty of Rome – where there is no media pluralism, where a prime minister directly or indirectly controls the public and private TV and print media? What democratic electoral competition can exist in a country where a prime minister – a political party – controls the media? What democracy can exist in a country where a law that bans journalists from publishing judicial news is about to be approved in a matter of days? Forget about Watergate and the press upholding a regime! We are talking lapdogs here! What sort of democratic country wants to control the Internet? What sort of democratic country sidelines anyone who strays from the party line and fails to guarantee free speech and the right to dissent? We are not describing Sudan under Bokassa or Romania under Ceauşescu: this is Italy under Berlusconi, where such things are unfortunately allowed to happen, not least because the European Commission does not have the courage to adopt an independent and free stance with regard to the Member States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to highlight the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I proposed together with four other MEPs, and which half of the European Parliament, plus one, approved, with the aim of committing the Council and Commission to legislation that is truly effective in fighting corruption. I have returned from a visit to Greece on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control and one of the reasons behind the Greek structural crisis is certainly the squandering of public money, something which also occurs in Italy: Italy is eaten away by corruption, as we have recently seen. This corruption mainly hinges on the illegal management of public money, and the relationship between one political faction and a faction of businessmen and white-collar organised crime. It is important for the European Parliament to make its full pressure felt on the Commission and on Member States – Member States that do not conform should be penalised – and for the European institutions responsible for controlling corruption and the fight against organised crime to be strengthened.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recently, there has been yet another environmental disaster in Italy, on the River Lambro and the River Po. Also recently, the Court of Justice in Luxembourg condemned Italy for endangering public health with their illegal waste disposal and their inability to control the collection of waste in Campania. An increase in cases of leukaemia has been reported recently in Taranto through the Ilva steelworks, as well asbestos removal in schools in Crotone and dioxins in Campania. It is an ongoing environmental disaster. I strongly ask the Commission what it intends to do to ensure that the Italian Government falls in line with standards of the European Union directives, particularly with regard to the recent ruling by the Court of Justice, which strongly condemned Italy for not being able to dispose of waste in Campania. For many weeks and months, the city of Naples was a laughing stock all over the world. Luigi de Magistris,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome and thank the President of the Court of Auditors, with whom we have worked productively during this period. As Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I have always maintained that the role played by the Court of Auditors is fundamental. It is fundamental because the Court operates in a very sensitive sector, which people throughout the European Union watch with great interest and with a critical eye where the transparency, accuracy and legality of expenditure and of the management of public funds are concerned. I believe that it must be reiterated today that the Court should always be guaranteed independence and autonomy when carrying out its work because this is fundamental if we are to be able to evaluate properly and to make good decisions. Likewise, we ask the Court to put Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control in a position to carry out their own work as productively as possible. We must find the right balance which allows public funds to be spent effectively and efficiently, because these funds are aimed at important objectives such as economic development and job creation. At the same time, there must be severe punishments for serious irregularities and errors, which the Court has also uncovered in the last financial year, whilst an attempt must be made to avoid unnecessary formalities and red tape. As Mr Kallas was also saying, Parliament must strive to find an equilibrium in the tolerable risk of error. The report, which we have read with great interest, provides some insights, but also includes many grey areas. We must strive to achieve the best results regarding these grey areas. As my fellow Members have also mentioned, the main problems primarily concern the Structural and Cohesion Funds. It is true that the Court, in doing its job, points out errors and irregularities in relation to these funds. However, those who are able to look deeply into and to analyse matters can see that, behind the errors highlighted, there are even graver issues, as the judicial experiences of several countries in recent years demonstrate. There may be fraud, there may be deception. I am specifically referring to one or two errors revealed such as the contravention of rules on procurement, over-invoicing and so on. We must endeavour to make improvements in this area. I believe that the Commission should promote Member States which behave in a virtuous manner, and punish and penalise Member States which do comply with the rules. Furthermore, I believe it is very important for OLAF to use the Court of Auditors’ suggestions as a starting point and to further improve its work because it is in everyone’s interest that it does so. I think it is only through cooperation among various institutions, namely Parliament, the Court of Auditors and OLAF, that we will manage to safeguard the financial interests of all EU citizens.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I must acknowledge the very important work accomplished by the committee and the excellent job done by the rapporteur, as well as the political solidarity that has been on show. This is because, from the outset, we wished to send a very clear message: we intend to work with great rigour to ensure transparency, accuracy and legality in the management of public funds and, therefore, in auditing the budgets. Very significant progress has been made with the Council, which at first did not want to respond. I would like to personally congratulate the Swedish Presidency on this. It has always set out to act to promote transparency and accuracy. From that point of view, we therefore expect further progress, because obviously it is absolutely unacceptable, particularly with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, that Parliament should not have the information and details required to monitor budgets and public funds, in the interest not only of the European Union but also of all European citizens. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening’s very interesting debate has helped us to understand some very important points, particularly concerning the European Crime Prevention Network. Firstly, now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament’s role in the framework of codecision procedure must be increasingly enhanced, and in two ways. First, culture: organised crime and mafia organisations can be eliminated above all with information and awareness. A great Italian judge, Giovanni Falcone, who was murdered by the Mafia, used to say that the latter was a phenomenon that had a beginning and an end. The end must consist of a huge mobilisation in cultural terms, and it must start in Europe and in Parliament. A second point is that organised crime must be combated more effectively, above all with the introduction of the European public prosecution service, and I think also with the inclusion of certain very serious crimes, foreseen only in certain Member States. I am thinking, for instance, of mafia crimes. We must understand that the mafia crisis concerns the whole of Europe, since mafia organisations have the capacity to penetrate right through institutions as well. There is a very close relationship between mafia organisations and corruption, as recent reports have also emphasised, and fraud in the European Union, as we were recently told by the European Court of Auditors too. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that Parliament should be very concerned by the latest report from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation. Indeed, while some governments in the European Union, and most recently the Italian Government, continue to make immigration a criminal offence, violate the right to asylum and indiscriminately refuse entry, I believe that we need strong cooperation since it is a disgrace that the level of poverty described by the FAO in Africa, the Middle East and Asia still exists. Cooperation does not mean undertaking pointless projects which merely generate business for the same old companies, but helping these countries to emancipate themselves. Another disgrace which Parliament needs to address is the privatisation of water, something in which certain governments of the EU engage. Water is a resource that belongs to everyone, an essential resource and not a commodity at the service of the multinationals. Luigi de Magistris  (ALDE
).

 Mr President, I would like to talk about the tragedy in Messina – which the President of the European Parliament has recalled today – and its dozens of casualties. So another tragedy has been reported in Italy: the Italian Prime Minister has even claimed that it was a foreseeable tragedy. It may have been foreseeable, but nothing was done to prevent it. Nothing was done because the area is ruled by concrete, by the concrete mafia, by the forest mafia, with their forest fires. However, what the European Parliament should focus on above all is the way in which public money and also the aid allocated by the European Union can be invested in a different form of regional development, to ensure that construction work is carried out properly and the severe environmental damage that has been done can be rectified. More often than not, these public funds end up being pocketed by criminal societies, corrupt politicians and the Mafia. This legislative term must therefore focus on what happens to public funds, which should really be used to restore nature, to protect natural resources, to generate eco-friendly economic development and to create jobs. There must be no more horrific tragedies like the one in Messina. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important decision. The debate has become quite heated but that is because the industrial and employment situation in our countries is extremely difficult. This is an important decision in both real and symbolic terms, since we are dealing with a matter of principle. We must send out a sign of legality and respect in view of the all of the efforts being made by our business world. When I say ‘our world’, I do not mean it in a protectionist sense; I mean that the business community looks to the decision-making in Strasburg and Brussels with a feeling of belonging, searching for guarantees that only the Commission, Parliament, our institutions, can provide for fairer trade. However, we must tread cautiously: this is also a business world that looks at China as a great export opportunity, and that in certain sectors is actually managing to stay afloat precisely because of the market it has managed to develop in China. Thus we are not attempting to be protectionist and raise barricades. We simply do not want to be deceived, especially in an area such as photovoltaics, so crucial for our sustainable future. However, Commissioner, we must try to speed up this investigation so that any compensation can be estimated and claimed much sooner than planned. Moreover, since all of this debate is really about what to do in the wake of something that has already happened, we must also work on prevention. We should therefore strengthen the bilateral agreements to avoid any repeat of this kind of situation with China or other countries in future. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the list of tragedies in Cambodia is very long indeed: crimes against the environment, stratospheric corruption, waste of international aid, aggression against human rights activists, and a very shrewd dictator, who plays with democracy to give himself a semblance of legitimacy and who is still there. Now there is also the issue of the leader of the opposition, who is exiled from Cambodia. Yet I believe there is also another misfortune in that country, and that is an international community that is too obliging, and I have to say that that includes the European Union. Accompanying Graham Watson during our delegation’s visit to Cambodia, we felt that the Commission’s attitude was not sufficiently firm and robust. In Parliament, there is a robustness in the various debates on Cambodia that I would like to see in the other institutions too. Within the framework of European cooperation, I think it important to reflect on the case of Sam Rainsy who, among other things, won, through the efforts of the European People’s Party, an important human rights prize here in this institution. Perhaps that is the acid test, to try to have him return before the elections. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, well done to Russia for its accession to the World Trade Organisation, and I agree with the various boundaries set and the guidance given in the resolution. As a member of the delegation to the EU-Kazakhstan, EU-Kyrgyzstan and EU-Uzbekistan Parliamentary Cooperation Committees, and for relations with Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Mongolia, I would like to add something else that has not yet been mentioned in this debate, namely that Russia has made an effort to redraft its position both with respect to the WTO, and therefore the international community and particularly the Western nations and, through the Customs Union, with respect to the Eurasian countries. I believe we need to think carefully about the compatibility of the WTO and Russia’s accession to it, the new bilateral agreement being negotiated with Russia by the EU, and the Customs Union. I think this is one of the most complicated aspects. We do not yet know how the Customs Union will evolve, or whether as expected it will lead to a common economic area based on the four freedoms of movement that exist in the EU, but I believe that we should be taking an integrated approach to Russia on the one hand and Central Asia on the other. There is no point in creating antagonism between these two areas, bearing in mind the umbilical cord that links Russia with Central Asia. For example, we need to try to ensure that the Customs Union’s standards as regards safety and anti-trust rules are still in line with European standards, and I am also wondering what good the abolition of the visa system will do in these negotiations.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, in itself the Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) is an excellent piece of work. It focuses on simplification, which is certainly desirable, but, to be frank, it would be naive to consider it a technical agreement. There is a long list of requests to the Israeli authorities from the European Union, from the High Representative, from our consulates in East Jerusalem, and from this Parliament on the settlements in the West Bank, on the continuing annexation of East Jerusalem, on the situation in Gaza and on the resumption of the peace process. If we look at what the EU has obtained with these requests, we see neither real progress nor any serious concessions. I therefore consider this to be anything but a politically neutral measure. My delegation will vote against the ACAA and I am calling on the Commission, should the ACAA be approved, to exercise the highest possible degree of oversight, both in terms of traceability of products to the Occupied Territories, which is a problem that has nothing to do with the good faith of the Commission but rather with Israel, and extension of the agreement to other products without the involvement of the European Parliament.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tone of this debate has changed since June, when we were among the few voices calling for a swift launch to negotiations for a free trade agreement. Japan has always been a very complex case, more difficult to deal with, understand and decipher than many other countries. We now find ourselves under strong pressure from the Member States and many sectors to move as slowly as possible in the direction of a free trade agreement, as if Japan were enemy number one of European industry. I urge the Commission to proceed with a dual approach. On the one hand, it must be firm, since we have included several conditions in our resolution that are entirely advantageous, with great emphasis on non-tariff barriers. However, an effort must also be made to ensure that it is used as far as possible to provide opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, to create the possibility of cultural cooperation with Japan – since as a country it is an ideal candidate with great potential in this area – and to undertake joint scientific research with one of the leading innovators. The second approach should be to make the agreement a success, since it is much more important than so many other agreements in geopolitical terms. It can serve to stabilise relations with South Korea and our economic and trade relations with China. Let us recall that we are dealing with a great democracy, and that this is one of the chief aspects of the agreement. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we support the proposal resulting from the compromise in the Committee on International Trade. We believe a very reasonable balance has been achieved. On one hand, we have a firm date, a deadline. I would ask you all to consider how absurd it would be to reject the committee’s proposal while we have obligations in the World Trade Organisation that we have to fulfil. On the other hand, we are allowing a couple of years more, thereby at least partly meeting the demands of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. I think this debate needs to be kept in proportion. After all, as the Commissioner pointed out in his speech as well, we are talking about an extremely limited volume of trade, although the decision we make tomorrow will be very important to some ACP capitals. There is a kind of asymmetry between the significance that we attach to what is at stake and how certain ACP countries perceive it. I do not believe that setting such a tight deadline – which might almost seem like an imposition, at least in the eyes of some ACP countries – is an effective way of bringing the negotiations on economic partnership agreements to a swifter conclusion. We do want these agreements. However, these partnership agreements need to be concluded in the best possible way, through persuasion and trying to win the other side round. These two extra years, if they are indeed both necessary, could be an opportunity for us to step up our negotiating efforts, not least by expanding the range of people we talk to in addition to just the governments. The general public in these countries remains somewhat wary, so we must also focus on the members of the national parliaments, who often do not ratify agreements but do carry political weight and influence in the debate in their countries and complain that they are not given enough information. As I proposed during our ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Horsens, it may perhaps be necessary to organise public seminars with the media and non-governmental organisations to explain our position properly. There is a Kenyan proverb that says ‘If you want to go far, go together’. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in November 2010, many of us asked the Commission to wait before signing the agreement and present an impact assessment first. The Commission decided to go ahead and sign straight away, assuring us that everything was fine, only to subsequently turn to the Court of Justice and receive a worrying warning from the EU privacy supervisor. Meanwhile, citizens in the EU mobilised in an unprecedented way, with 2.8 million signatures, whilst many entrepreneurs have reacted cautiously with regard to the future of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), precisely because they believe that existing laws can protect them just as effectively. I think that there are two lessons in this, and I hope that the Commission will learn from them with regard to the next measures announced by the Commissioner. The first lesson is that the Web is now considered by European citizens to be a real common good, like biodiversity or water. It is considered a space for individual freedom that must not be threatened by any kind of measure. In Washington, Senator Wyden, Chair of the Subcommittee on International Trade, whom I visited last February, told us that with ACTA, experiences such as Wikipedia
 might have not come into being. I do not know if this statement corresponds to the truth, but we must also adopt the precautionary principle. Secondly, we cannot implement important measures without the citizens’ approval, and there is a need for debate, which so far has been clearly insufficient. I think this should be understood and, if we do not understand it, I believe we will not go very far in today’s Europe. I became familiar with ACTA just after I was elected. I have followed this agreement as shadow rapporteur in a thousand debates in committee, in plenary, – and I have to say the Commission has always shown a very loyal and cooperative attitude – in interviews and in debates with civil society. I do not know if this will be the last debate. I must say that we will certainly be ready for further discussion and, Commissioner, I really do not hope that we will be able to say ‘acta est fabula’
, the play is over. This is in the public interest, in the interest of freedom of expression and, I must say, in the interest of the European institutions’ image as well. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there have been delays in dealing with this agreement in the Committee on International Trade (INTA), but there are many other very different kinds of delays on the ground with regard to improving the condition of the Palestinian population. This is a debate on how to prevent products from the settlements from benefiting from this agreement – this is a red line that cannot be crossed. I appreciate what the Commissioner has said, but it is also true that so far, we have not had any mechanisms that have worked. It is also a debate on the political impact of this agreement, because I believe, indeed I fear, that its adoption would be interpreted as opening a credit line in favour of a government that does not give much credit, so to speak, to questions from the European Union. No tangible progress in the resumption of negotiations, much less on the continued expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem, much less with regard – apart from some modest progress – to the Gaza blockade. For this reason, the treatment of this dossier is more than technical; it is a highly political dossier, not a trivial one, and we call upon the Commission to assess how a trade policy measure can, as is normal in this context, become a foreign policy act on the ground. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it would be a shame if Parliament and the Council failed to give the green light to negotiations with Japan, though this time around asking for something we have never previously asked for in similar situations. I agree with the rapporteur Metin Kazak: if there are no negotiations, Japan will look further east – as Mr Susta said just now – to the rest of Asia and to the Pacific rather than to Europe. Such a closure would be paradoxical for us, given that it is a fully democratic country, whereas we have ongoing negotiations with other countries that are dictatorships in one way or another, such as Vietnam or Singapore. Moreover, let there be no talk about the European crisis as a reason for holding back such negotiations. The crisis will not be defeated by clamping shut like a clam, through protectionism. The crisis will be defeated by open, intelligent trade, by a wisdom that we have perhaps not always had, and by basing our stance on reciprocity, as I – together with Mr Daul, Mr Guerrero Salom, Mr Susta and Ms Muscardini – called for in written statement No 0016/2012 on fair trade, which I invite you all to sign. In this case, it means not closing the door on Japan, but negotiating measures to ensure the removal of non-tariff barriers, bilateral safeguards for sensitive sectors – and we can strengthen such safeguards – the protection of geographical indications for our products, the removal of barriers that hamper trade today, especially for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which could otherwise find a further outlet in Japan, the opening up of Japanese public procurement to our companies, including SMEs, a mechanism for judging business disputes which today we are finding hard to put in place, as well as cooperation on post-Fukushima energy, based on sustainable development. These and other things we can ask for and obtain from Japan. We cannot agree with simply giving up from the start. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats fully supports the new generalised scheme of tariff preferences (GSP), which rationalises the mechanism and makes it more consistent with its constituent objectives of support for countries in the developing world. Congratulations to the rapporteur, Christofer Fjellner, who managed to strike a balance between the various options. There are now two commitments to undertake immediately. We need to coordinate the application of GSP with that of bilateral free trade agreements, first and foremost, so as not to alter the preferential nature of GSP for developing countries, which could even find themselves penalised by less favourable access conditions than those granted to the beneficiaries of bilateral agreements. Even more important is the monitoring of its entry into force, especially of effective compliance with international conventions on human rights, trade union rights, environmental protection and the rule of law. In this area, we have important news: the burden of proof is reversed, meaning it will be up to countries that are potentially non-compliant with these conventions to demonstrate that they are using the criteria of good governance and respect for human rights, by virtue of which they may enjoy this generalised system of preferences. The fact that information on this matter may come not only from the international organisations themselves, promoters of these conventions, but also from Parliament, the Council and especially from civil society, transforms this scheme into a much more participatory and democratic one. There are no less than 27 conventions to observe, including the United Nations one on climate change. This part of the scheme, without which this good work would, for the most part, be in vain, now needs to be fully implemented. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, in our view there are two basic elements here. The first is the issue of democracy, which means full involvement of the European Parliament in decisions on macro-financial assistance (MFA), its implementation and its suspension. Given that these are not technical or executive decisions, it is important that Parliament always be called upon to give its opinion. The second is political conditionality. As has already been pointed out, there is no point in setting up a European External Action Service if it is not fully involved in decisions as important as macro-financial assistance; there is no point in focusing on human rights and then failing to take them into account when making important decisions. I will add a third issue, which I regard as important: Central Asia is not mentioned explicitly among the beneficiaries of MFA, even though they are countries with which we have important economic relations. The European Union has its own specific strategy on Central Asia and it is vital that macro-financial assistance be one of its pillars. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, South Sudan no longer represents the good news we were still hoping for just one year ago. The peoples of South Sudan and of Sudan are enjoying neither peace, stability nor, least of all, development. ‘Walk on your own two legs, walk for a long time, find water and share it’, goes an old saying from the region, but this certainly does not reflect reality. Today, at the most, people walk for a long time but, if they have not stepped on a mine first, water is not easy to find until the rainy season. In fact, it is not easy to help Juba, just as it is not easy to put pressure on Khartoum. However, I believe that action by the Commission, the European External Action Service and the European Union ought to be based on certain fundamental principles. Above all, we must keep attention focused on this crisis, so that it does not risk becoming a forgotten crisis, one of those points on the agenda that is shelved and deprived of the attention of the media and the international community. Secondly, we must insist on full application of Security Council Resolution 2046, which is a key element. Thirdly, we must not be unprepared for what may happen in Khartoum, keeping in mind the fact that Sadiq al-Mahdi, former Sudanese prime minister, evoked the prospect of an Arab Spring in Sudan, in view of the failures both of the administration and of President al-Bashir himself. Let us therefore remain vigilant, to avoid a recurrence of what happened in North Africa. Fourthly, as we are the main donor to South Sudan, we should have more say in the application of laws in Juba. Currently, uniformed soldiers in South Sudan are appropriating land in an arbitrary fashion. The Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement must re-establish its credibility as far as citizens are concerned, which will be quite difficult without a minimum legal system that is effective and independent. This ought to be the European Union’s first priority. Without delay, I will finish with a final point, to which we have already drawn attention: the creation for South Sudan of a transparent fund to collect the proceeds of oil resources, as happened in Timor. Objections may be made that Timor was good news: well, we would like South Sudan to be good news too. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, Ms de Sarnez, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome this report by the vice-chair of the Liberal and Democratic group, a group that believes, perhaps more than others, in trade as a means of spreading well-being and stability worldwide. This is, nevertheless, a report that cuts to the heart of several matters, provocatively at times and without mincing words right from the introduction. There, it clearly states that, on the one hand, China is getting the most from its membership of the World Trade Organisation while, on the other, its economy is not fully recognised as a market economy. It is a slightly anomalous economy, run by the Communist party, with tariff and non-tariff barriers, discrimination in many sectors, subsidies, obstacles of various kinds, bars to participation in public tenders, export credits and much more besides. What is to be done, then, about China, given that it is a country with which we now have considerable economic and trade interpenetration? The first answer from this report is reciprocity, a principle that is seldom practised nowadays and is not easy to enact, but which is the key to this relationship. At the end of the day, is it really that difficult to make it happen? In recent weeks, with several colleagues – Mr Daul, Chair of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats); Mr Guerrero Salom, Vice-chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament; Mr Susta; and Ms Muscardini – we have been working on written statement No 16, with the aim of basing our trade policy on some key concepts: reciprocity, the agreement of environmental and social parameters, transparency, consumer protection, World Trade Organisation rules, and human rights. Tibet has already been mentioned. These are not slogans but values, which – as this report states – if put into practice in our trade relations, represent the best approach not only for sustainable trade, but also for a less extreme and happier China.

 Mr Martin, I believe that China’s membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is a good thing; it would be a mistake to have China outside the WTO, because matters would become much more complicated. Besides, the battles fought by the Commission, among others, within the WTO through various disputes – such as that on raw materials – have been very effective and satisfying. Furthermore, the WTO can certainly also be relied upon as regards various anti-dumping procedures. That does not mean, however, that we can lower our guard when it comes to granting China market economy status, on the one hand, or, on the other, that we should not exploit our own provisions, such as reciprocity, to demonstrate a firmer stance. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologise to the Commissioner – my dear friend. So, now is the time to give some practical responses to the Arab Spring. Europe has followed what has been happening on the opposite shore of the Mediterranean with enthusiasm. We have followed with enthusiasm, concern and a certain element of surprise what had happened and was happening during those months, and what is still happening with the difficult situations in Egypt, Libya especially, and of course Syria. Sometimes I – hesitantly – remember some of the statements by European foreign ministers who, not much more than a year ago, literally – and I remember this because it shows how far we have come – defined Gaddafi as an example of reformism for the rest of Africa, a statement made last February, and Syria as a country – and again I quote – capable of meeting its citizens’ need for modernity from its leadership. This is where we have come from. Another statement from February last year. In the end, however, with the support and empathy of Europe, the Arab Spring eventually emerged with difficulty, and it was a marvellous change. What has happened in the southern Mediterranean has been extraordinary, and is also a reason for great hope, but naturally there are a lot of difficulties ahead. What help can we give as Europeans? What can we do in practical terms to try and make these people taking steps towards democracy understand that economic development also offers prospects for a better life? We have two problems, among others. The first is that the potential for trade between the European Union and southern Mediterranean countries is definitely under-utilised. We are doing less than we could be doing. The report contains some figures, I will not quote them here, but given the geographical proximity and the fact that we all belong to a single area, Mediterranean Europe, the commercial policy figures are certainly rather unsatisfactory. The second problem is that traditionally we – especially the southern Mediterranean countries – have structured our trade relations in such a way that trade with Europe mainly benefited an elite, an oligarchy which often managed the flows from this trade in an extremely exclusive, if not selfish manner. The Arab Spring is trying to liberate political processes, and subsequently we also need to liberate the economy, in order to ensure that those who want to become producers and players in a global economic and commercial process in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Libya and the other countries really can do so, and can have a direct dialogue with Europe. This also means trying, also through a commercial policy, to provide practical help in a social situation that is sometimes desperate. In Egypt, revenues have fallen over 35% compared with during the Mubarak era. There is little investment, tourism is a resource that has almost run dry, and therefore we need new political tools, and here I think that in our work, we have proposed a series of practical elements to meet these expectations, and we will return to these in the final summary. Meanwhile, I would like to thank the Commission heartily for the constant support it has given me as well as the shadow rapporteurs. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to invite the Commission not to be too cautious, on the other hand, and, above all, I would like to invite the House not to be too fixated on the agricultural issue. We cannot carry on considering trade relations between the European Union and Mediterranean countries solely from the point of view of agriculture and, in fact, the report takes a totally different line. We asked for more connection with civil society, more study grants – and I would like to thank the Commissioner for what he said at the beginning on the development of the Erasmus Mundus
 programme – I believe – it is not an issue which concerns the DG Trade – but I believe that it would be useful also to have an Erasmus Med
, something specifically for the Mediterranean countries, as a written declaration from Parliament had, in fact, requested. We are calling for bilateral chambers of commerce between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries which do not yet exist. We are calling for new credit instruments, something – also through the work we have done with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) – is starting to happen, also for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and we are especially calling for liberalisation of this trade through the possibility of allowing new players and entities, like SMEs in fact, to emerge in southern Mediterranean countries. There is an extraordinary amount of talent in this area in the Arab countries that has always been suppressed by the oligarchies in power. In this sense, technical cooperation to dismantle non-tariff barriers – all elements of our report – is crucial. Let us not miss this opportunity. We have the opportunity to use commercial policy, the exclusive competence of the European Union, to do a truly political job, part of which has still not been done, in order to support these processes. There are those who say that nothing has happened, that there have been no Arab Springs. I challenge anyone in this House eighteen months ago to imagine that Mubarak, Ben Ali and Gaddafi would have fallen from power in their countries in the space of a just a few months. Something has happened, and the development and outcome depend also on us, and also on commercial policy instruments, and I must just briefly say a word about the contribution of our Green friends who have just left us: do not have an ideological approach. It is not true that commerce is not good for development, quite the opposite. The report demonstrates all the rest. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, after so much good news from Africa, what a lot of nasty surprises in Mali, a country which has even practised democracy successfully in recent years: we have had hostage taking, threats of secession from the North, the coup d'état
, fundamentalist gangs applying Sharia law, and the risk of famine; five problems, each of which is a human tragedy that is hard to resolve and, apart from anything else, these five problems are capable of contaminating the entire region. Mali is a collateral victim, partly of the conflict that took place in Libya, and finds itself caught up in an issue that is bigger than itself, bigger than the Malian political class. The real reasons have their origins outside its borders as well as in issues related to the conflict in Libya and, as has been said, even further afield. When, in our resolution, we call for a post-Gaddafi strategy for the entire region, we want political and security cooperation to be much more thorough, to go beyond contacts, and, in conjunction with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union and the United Nations in their respective roles, both food security and political security can be guaranteed, knowing that the later you intervene, the harder it is to find a solution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the many misadventures of Nigeria include the deaths of Franco Lamolinara and Chris McManus, two European citizens who were killed during the failed attempt to free them. This was a very sad episode not only because of their deaths, but also because of the way the operation was coordinated between the countries involved, and for the apparent absence of any European involvement dear Commissioner. Italy has complained about the lack of information about what was about to happen – and this is already one issue – but I must say to the Commissioner that the citizens of Europe need a visible face of our shared foreign policy that is able to face its responsibilities on behalf of Member States, especially where there is little coordination, as was the case in Nigeria. Today, many people are licking their wounds, the Italians who were unable to be part of the liberation plan, the British for a failed operation and Europe for having kept a low profile. We condemn terrorism, which is also a phenomenon totally alien to African culture, and call on Nigeria to do its utmost, but we must also learn what the EU’s responsibilities are, and quickly, if we want to be taken seriously by Europe’s citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the blessed sweetness of its finished product, the cocoa market has been practically cursed from the very start. When Francesco Carletti, a Florentine trader who was the first to circumnavigate the Earth using merchant ships between the late 1500s and early 1600s, brought cocoa to Europe, he denounced a business in which the main financing for investments in this plant was derived from the slave trade. Ever since then, the inhumane nature of the cocoa trade has persisted. If the product comes from Ghana or Côte d’Ivoire – which account for almost 60% of global output – then the use of children is a given, the majority of whom are less than 14 years old and often subject to genuine trafficking, which sees them taken away from their families in nearby countries and shut away in the plantations. Last week, I was in Côte d’Ivoire for an annual meeting of Euro-African liberal democrat members of parliament. There, I met the President of the main non-governmental organisation (NGO) that fights against the exploitation of children in cocoa plantations. The organisation is not without support, since even the wife of President Ouattara has come to its aid, opening the national surveillance committee against child exploitation and labour. That said, we need to move away from depending on volunteers, good examples and harsh words, and instead imbue the markets with a sense of social responsibility that has so far been lacking in the cocoa plantations, with their distinctive non-intensive, non-mechanical culture, and the aggravating factor of the use of pesticides that are harmful to workers. The agreement that has been signed – for which I should like to thank Mr Moreira and the Commission – is a step in the right direction, making the chocolate supply chain more transparent, involving NGOs and promoting fairer prices around the world. Since the EU controls most of the votes of importer countries in international cocoa organisations, it has a special responsibility to put the agreement quickly into action and use it as a way to make the production of this popular treat more humane. As significant as it is, however, this agreement alone will not suffice. We also need consumers to be more aware so that they can make ethical purchases, while also promoting the production and sale of fair trade chocolate, which guarantees prices for producers and that no children were exploited in the plantations of Africa during the process. The EU can do much more in this area, including by setting out regulations on (European) certification that has so far been a private initiative. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Menéndez del Valle, who I congratulate, is a very important document as part of the effort we are making, in the Committee on International Trade and in Parliament as a whole, to define new rules and provide a different impetus for trade in the Mediterranean. It is an essential task and one of the great challenges – taking advantage of the exclusive jurisdiction of the European Union on matters of international trade – to provide solutions to those countries that still today have vast untapped potential in terms of trade policy with us. It is not only a matter of bringing about greater stability and prosperity, but also of expanding the social and production base among those who may benefit from the trade policy. In my view, this convention should have three important effects: firstly, promoting South-South trade, now almost at a minimum in the Mediterranean; secondly, promoting market access for small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to operate what I call – as the rapporteur for another measure – ‘Trade for Change’, in other words, trade measures for countries undergoing democratisation in the southern Mediterranean – liberating economic and commercial processes in countries where the few oligarchies in power have centralised the proceeds from trade into their own hands; and finally, making this trade more readily understandable through simple rules. The problem of Israel must also be addressed because otherwise, the credibility of Parliament is at stake. This is an important work: we often wonder why we have only now managed to simplify the 100 plus different regulations governing rules of origin. It is now important for everyone to ratify it as soon as possible. What is happening with regard to the ratification of the mandate of the European Investment Bank for the Mediterranean is not very encouraging, given that Member States are proceeding very slowly. We hope that there will not be the same delay for the convention. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, to be perhaps a little provocative, we could have opened this sitting with a minute’s silence in memory of the more than 600 homeless people who have died this week from the cold. This is the tribute that we generally reserve for great and famous people. That would have represented an assumption of responsibility – perhaps the first by this Parliament – of great symbolic significance. In fact, what we are witnessing is that the instruments of participatory democracy for the defence of rights provided by the Union are incapable of being applied to the homeless, whether or not they are citizens of the European Union, and this is because, I am afraid, there is often no electoral consensus for this. The Vice-President, Mr Barnier, is quite right to remind us that this is a matter within the competence, above all, of the Member States. However, we are dealing here with a phenomenon that is ever more European, cross-border and visible. We therefore ask: what is the timetable for the strategy that we have demanded from the Commission on a number of occasions? How much – aside from the Progress programme – can be allocated from European funds, including the structural and social cohesion funds? We ask in addition: is free movement for the homeless genuinely guaranteed, or is it possible for a Member State to impose restrictions, precisely because these citizens –European citizens – may not have a fixed place of abode at their disposal? Finally, are basic support services guaranteed? Some Member States have refused this to citizens of other Member States, citing European regulations. Are we sure that this is legally admissible? In conclusion, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has established that every European citizen wastes 179 kilograms of food per year. What European strategy should we adopt to combat this waste? I consider that this is an economic and social issue but above all one of the identity of our own European Union. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the most visible aspect of the changes affecting Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (the BRICS), which is also the most significant one in terms of consequences for the life of our societies, regards the economic and commercial penetration of these emerging powers. These changes may lead to stability and widespread prosperity, but appropriate speed is required, both in terms of responses in the international rules – and we know that unfortunately the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations are at a standstill – and in terms of greater integration of our foreign policy with trade policy, taking into account the fact that our foreign policy in some respects is unfortunately still in its infancy, while trade policy, thanks to the exclusive competences of the Treaty of Lisbon, is fully functional. I am wondering, for example, what the role of trade attachés in our embassies is. These trade attachés are not part of the European External Action Service, but will play a key role in the BRICS countries, one that is as important, if not more so, as that of our diplomats.

 Mr President, I am honoured to have been the promoter of this plenary debate. I believe that European prisons suffer from at least two problems. The first is that it is quite difficult to have the instruments of European democracy enter these institutions. In prisons, there are human rights abuses and people’s dignity is mortified, as concerns both detainees and those who work in the prisons, such as the warders. Prisons are overcrowded, a sign of lack of investment: people are crowded in together and the door is shut. There is little knowledge of prison regulations, while copies of them should be distributed and clearly understood by all. There is abdication of the principal role of re-education that prisons should play, not least because employment for detainees is no longer facilitated inside prisons. There is little transparency and hardly any opening to citizens, schools and non-governmental organisations. Budget cuts threaten essential services and the training of personnel and there is an overall lack of interest by the media and politicians. I now go on to the second point. Personally, as part of the initiative that Marco Pannella launched in Italy, for the past three years, I have visited two prisons on 15 August – the day that is most symbolic of holidays – and I have been struck by the absence of the European dimension within them. There are no exchanges of good practices, and few are the moments of contact between the staff and operators from the various European countries. I therefore applaud the publication of this Green Paper, which may cast light on a series of issues: how to improve mutual trust and, naturally, detention conditions; how to associate detention conditions with European regulations on preventive detention, the European arrest warrant, the conditions of minors, the power to inspect, the right to visits by families and all the activities of cultural mediators, which are necessary. The Council is present today and many answers depend on it. We are dealing with a test of civilisation, that is, of European identity. Prisons will always be prisons. I do not believe that the solution lies in emptying them, but they must cease to be those dark corners of rights and European responsibilities. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, I shall begin with a poem by an Uzbek poet, Jogdor Obid (I translate from the English): ‘Little hands, little slaves dream of warm and sunny days, but suffer from coughs and tremble as they walk. Little hands and little slaves, children’s thoughts, dreams of tenderness, but it all ends up dead and buried’. This is the testimony of Jogdor Obid, describing cotton-picking by children in Uzbekistan. This took place in the period of the Soviet Union. Some things have changed, others have not. For example, the power structure has not changed: the Uzbek President today is the same one who, in 1991, was at the head of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Uzbekistan. Other things have changed: the situation of children in the cotton fields is worse, much worse. In other interviews, Jogdor Obid speaks of seven-year-olds who are slaves, being bought and sold in Uzbekistan to harvest cotton. This is an intolerable situation: our demands are the same as those already mentioned: access for International Labour Organisation (ILO) inspectors; for Uzbekistan to act in accordance with the values of human rights, which are, in fact, included in the country’s constitution; for the Commission to propose a traceability mechanism for the cotton harvested, free from the trade in children and their condition as slaves; again for the Commission, also on the basis of the ILO findings, possibly to decide the suspension of the Generalised System of Privileges (GSP) for Uzbekistan. We have done this with the Sri Lanka GSP+, and we could think of doing the same with Uzbekistan. Naturally, there will be no agreement on this protocol by the European Parliament, which can rely on its new Lisbon powers; at stake are the ever-stricter values of the European Union, not least as concerns our international trade policy.

 Mr President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso, Commissioner Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, just yesterday the Italian statistics office reported that the figure for tax evasion in Italy in 2008 was between 16% and 17% of GDP, which comes to between EUR 255 billion and EUR 275 billion. With such figures there will never be any control of the deficit. In its annual report the Italian Court of Audit spoke of the cost of corruption for 2009 at EUR 60 billion, adding that we will never have any kind of growth. The income gap is widening, and we therefore have no social cohesion. I believe it is imperative for the EU to update its convergence criteria, also adding parameters relating to good governance and social equality. I should say that the verification carried out by the Commission on the tax shield of the last Italian government, that from our point of view violated a large part of the European standards on money laundering, competition and tax evasion – as well as on VAT evasion which, following our appeal, was proven to be correct – demonstrates lack of attention on the part of these institutions regarding an approach that should be fair and global.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s call to tighten up its budget brings a moment of truth for countries who have squandered and badly managed their own resources. However, it should also be a moment of truth for Europe with regard to growing social exclusion, and the need to denounce and resolve it. It is enough to read the Caritas reports and speak to volunteers committed to tackling urban poverty to understand the extent of the phenomenon which now affects even those who never thought they would find themselves in a soup kitchen or a hostel. It is enough to look around. A few weeks ago in Paris, in Place de la Bastille, I saw a homeless couple sleeping rough, with a new-born baby between them. There were others in Rue St-Antoine – so we are talking about a wealthy part of Paris – another couple on the ground, on cardboard boxes, with two children under the covers as well. I stopped to look at the reactions of passers-by and, over the course of 15 minutes, no one even stopped to look. The indifference of a large portion of our citizens is another face of this emergency. Last year, I spent a night in Rome with Emmaus volunteers. I learnt a lot, but I also discovered that they were scandalously alone. With this report, which the Italy of Values will support, we ask that a problem which we often prefer to ignore is not forgotten. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must thank the rapporteur, Mr Kósa, who has been as tireless as ever. This report begins by citing 40 or so official reference documents, including United Nations conventions, communications from the European Parliament and the Commission, resolutions, green papers and miscellaneous acts, which makes one realise just how much work has been carried out over the years on legislation, regulations, guidelines and recommendations in the field of disability. Moreover, this report puts forward a long list of objectives to further the inclusion of our fellow citizens with disabilities. I would like to mention two of these objectives in particular. The first is the participation of people with disabilities in the decision-making process, based on the principle of ‘nothing about us without us’. The second objective is to regard this subject as a human and civil rights issue, in other words, not an issue about a single group of people, but one that touches on the very identity of the European Union. The reality in Europe is very different, however, Mr President, because sadly, we are witnessing an increase in the suffering and pain of people with disabilities in our countries. We see structural funds that should be available but are shamefully left unused by Member States or local authorities, and we see infringements by these same Member States or local authorities that are not punished as they should be by the Commission. We see good practice in some countries, but unfortunately, it is ignored and not exported or valued elsewhere, and we see treatment that varies from one country to another or from one region to another within the same country, which limits considerably the freedom of movement of our fellow citizens with disabilities.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we could hear a small businessman or woman speak in this Chamber today, we would hear a story that is even more worrying than the details we have been given, especially because of the four structural problems facing this sector, which is a crucial sector and an integral part of Europe’s identity. The four problems are help for internationalisation, reducing red tape – we have heard about the hurdles that have to be overcome just to pay VAT in the various countries – innovation and access to the Structural Funds, which some Member States are not using as they should, and access to credit. Commissioner, it is unacceptable that Europe should recapitalise the banks without imposing strict conditions to make them facilitate access to credit for such a crucial sector of the European economy as small and medium-sized enterprises, which are now not being rewarded but held to ransom, if not crippled, by the credit institutions.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, we received a delegation of citizens who described themselves as ‘indignant’. Some have come a long way to get to Brussels, even travelling by foot from Iceland. Being indignant is the exact opposite of cynicism, indifference and resignation. It is a non-violent, transparent way of asking for the current European crisis to be tackled, rewarding the European institutions for being assertive and playing a leading role rather than being at the mercy of national governments, but, above all, it is a way of tackling this crisis with tools involving the real participation of the people. The European Union will have to take difficult, even unpopular decisions. Yesterday’s meeting was short but significant, because it showed that we need to exploit this crisis in order to rebel against the tribal fragmentation of Europe, which prevents it from having a shared vision, but, above all, it showed that we need to involve citizens fully in processes from which, to date, they have felt excluded.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support and thank the rapporteur for the outstanding work she has accomplished in committee, sometimes in circumstances that can hardly be described as relaxed. Trade between the European Union and the Palestinian Authority is minimal. We are certainly a long way from achieving the full potential of this relationship, and who knows when we will also be able to implement the sections relating to fishing, considering the dual illegality the Gaza Strip is subject to: the illegality of the blockade by the Israelis and the illegality of the control exercised by Hamas over the Strip. However, we are finally taking full responsibility for our relations, we are making international trade a fully-fledged instrument of foreign policy and above all we recognise the Palestinian Authority as a negotiating partner with full rights. Paradoxically we are doing this while at the same time, at the UN headquarters in New York, we are dragging our feet on the question of recognising its independence. Let us now hope for rapid implementation with good will shown by all sides. This should include ensuring we do not grant the products of the Jewish colonies any kind of special trade privileges, either as products declared as Israeli or as Palestinian products.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree to a large extent with my fellow Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). There is a degree of hypocrisy and also one of hesitation in what the Commissioner told us. In the 2010 communication, a paradox emerged in that the word Taiwan can neither be written nor spoken. Yet, it is a small China; very democratic and extremely vital both from a trade point of view and in terms of technological innovation. There is a very real principle which we must adhere to, especially in our trade undertakings. Taiwan exists and it exists de facto as a Sovereign State; Taiwan is a full member of the World Trade Organisation; we have excellent trade links with Taiwan and it is negotiating or will negotiate free trade agreements with several third countries. Something else is also true, which is that China, the People’s Republic of China, always responds with much irritation to our contact with Taiwan, nevertheless we do get the impression that it would be able to adapt with a certain level of pragmatism to a next step. Therefore we return to the original question, which we have still not had a compelling response to: is a free trade agreement possible with Taiwan, even at a lower or sectoral level? I think that this Parliament would be ready to support the Commission in such an undertaking. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

(IT)
 Mr President, Minister, Mr Nicolai, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that there are three things we can be sure of. The first is our deep friendship with the Palestinian people, a people that is suffering, that suffers every day. One has to visit the occupied territories to see the daily suffering of the Palestinian people, and this is a people to whom the international community owes a debt. The second certainty is the tie that binds us to Israel as Europeans, a tie that is probably stronger than that with any other country outside the EU, because Israel is an indispensable part of Europe’s cultural and moral identity; it is part of our family. The third certainty, unfortunately, is that Europe is always divided or highly conservative in its positions. These limitations are clear also in this vote at the United Nations, which will probably be another mortifying occasion after the absence of any European policy to speak of in the Libyan crisis, and yet it is only up to us, Minister, Commissioner. European citizens are finally asking for a qualitative leap, a position from Europe as a whole and, if possible, I hope there will be a position in support of the declaration of independence, as many Israelis too are asking, contrary to their government, and as Palestinians are asking from a basic sense of justice. Support for independence would first of all be in line with the reality of the Palestine that there is, that exists despite everything, and that no one can cancel from the maps. Its identity paradoxically grows stronger in the national sentiment with every day that passes, thanks to the occupation. In second place the security and the very identity of Israel would be strengthened. This security and identity are guaranteed more by the existence of two separate States with clear borders than by the prospect – and this is something we should ask the Israeli leaders in 20 years’ time – of a single State shared by Palestinians and Israelis. Finally, this declaration of independence would be a break with the stagnant waters of European diplomacy and the negotiations that are going nowhere. If we fail to embrace this break then we are condemning ourselves, after the financial crisis, to remaining on the sidelines also of international diplomacy. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I recall meeting an Italian entrepreneur a few years ago in Uzbekistan. He was trying – successfully – to tie up some contracts to sell the shoes that he made in what was not much more than a workshop, without knowing Russian or much less Uzbek, yet he managed it. This is a slightly unusual example because, in the end, while the European Union is a major international economy, on the one hand, on the other, 90% of our revenue is created by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), of which only 15% export to outside the European Union and only 30% trade outside their own country. Essentially, we are faced with a contradiction that reveals a profound vulnerability. The very concept of an SME necessarily implies the ability to be reactive and flexible – as shown by this Italian entrepreneur in Uzbekistan – and these skills also apply to internationalisation. However, this potential is largely wasted. We do not use the opportunities presented by the markets, by consumer goods and by the new lightweight technologies that we could use in public tenders – though in that situation with a certain wariness, because I think the public procurement sector is still the most difficult for SMEs hoping to internationalise. Unfortunately, the tools available to SMEs are obviously not suited to their needs, which is the very reason behind this debate. There are too many instruments and too much bureaucracy involved in using them, as well as a lack of multilingual skills available to SMEs – which is a significant obstacle – and insufficient training and information. That is why we are asking the Commission for a thorough revision of the measures to assist in the internationalisation of SMEs, as well as for a precise target. Let us set ourselves an objective along the lines of doubling the rate of internationalisation among SMEs in 10 years – something we can use as a yardstick for the new policies. That said, we also call on SMEs, because internationalisation – quite aside from all the objective difficulties and hitherto inadequate instruments – is also a question of culture, mindset, openness and keeping up with the times. The survival of SMEs, millions of jobs and the identity of our Union are at stake. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to return to the previous point, namely Prime Minister Berlusconi’s visit to this institution, because, as we have learnt, it is already the subject of jibes and ridicule. I should just like to know, Mr President – in the light of your explanation that there has been no official request for a meeting and that there will be no official visit by the Italian Prime Minister to the European Parliament – whether you will be meeting him and what the status of that meeting would be, tomorrow, during a visit which, I can assure you, most members of the public in our country regard as something of a mockery, given that the Prime Minister was due to appear in court in Naples tomorrow.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is in favour of this request; many things have happened in the Mediterranean this year, and I think that the events in Libya over the last few weeks deserve our attention. We cannot postpone the vote until such time as Colonel Gaddafi is captured, if he is captured – because this could happen soon, or it could take a long time. It is clear that the Libyan situation is an ongoing crisis. Europe has not always spoken with one voice in recent months on Libya; at times it has even been weak, and I believe that, with a vote, with an official pronouncement from Parliament, we can make a decisive contribution.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a debate that fails to inspire much of a reaction among people. The issue of the Doha negotiations is far removed from most citizens, the media, and even many governments, which are now busy dealing with far more pressing financial and economic priorities. This is not a debate that truly excites Brussels, nor even, it seems to me, Geneva, at least not from what I have seen this year, both in the WTO Parliamentary Assembly and in its steering committee, of which I am a member. There is an air of resignation about the fact that nothing is happening now, that nothing must happen, that nothing can happen, that the challenges facing a better-regulated and more generous global market are too complicated, and that the boundaries between the opposing blocs – between emerging countries that regard themselves today as powers and the former powers of old, which are now struggling, countries in constant transition, with an identity crisis – are themselves always shifting and vague. In other words, the ship that the World Trade Organisation – and, therefore, we too – are aboard does not know where it is heading, because, as Seneca wrote, ‘If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favourable.’ In the meantime, Commissioner, the poorest countries are losing out: they were encouraged to comply with international trade rules, and a good 32 out of 48 of them have joined the WTO, but what good has it done them so far? Theirs is a paradoxical situation: they account for less than 1% of international trade, but have 12% of the world’s population, people who are often forced to live without access to basic services. The forthcoming Eighth WTO Ministerial Conference has a duty to adopt at least – I repeat, at least – a package of measures to help them, and yet we have received no guarantees on that score – anything but. We call on you, Commissioner, to look into this matter. Although it would have no significant impact on international trade balances, the poorest countries would benefit greatly from measures such as the introduction of duty-free access quotas for their products, the simplification of rules of origin, the introduction of measures to correct market distortions in sectors such as the cotton sector, the provision of technical assistance to internationalise their economies and – an extremely important requirement for us members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – the extension of the TRIPS waiver beyond 2016 for pharmaceutical products and data protection. As far as we understand, none of this has been agreed yet. I understand your disappointment, Commissioner – we are disappointed too. We support you and the Commission in your commendable efforts. If there is no prospect of meeting the needs of the poorest countries, then we can well imagine the situation regarding much more complex issues, such as the balance between emerging countries, the European Union and the United States. If I am not mistaken, Pascal Lamy today inaugurated work on the construction of the WTO’s new headquarters in Geneva: this is a first step, and I must say that the need for proactive and industrious efforts to revive the work programme, objectives and the identity of international trade itself has never been so great.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this modification of the Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament we have an opportunity to uphold two principles, namely the transnational list, so that we have something more than an embryo at last, and a genuine step in the direction of European federalism, and we in the Italia dei valori 
party welcome the rapporteur’s tenacity in this regard. However, it is a mistake to think that the transnational list alone will reawaken the interest of the citizens, half of whom already fail to vote in European elections. We need innovative quality indicators that are in touch with society. We in the Italia dei valori
 party have proposed in committee to set a ceiling on MEPs’ mandates, in order to change those in office and create a process of renewal. This amendment was rejected – on rather ridiculous grounds, in my view – by MEPs instinctively seeking to protect themselves and their position. We are committed to making other changes for the next part-session: the first change concerns the regional dimension of elected representatives and constitutions – of MEPs – to ensure that they have a strong relationship with their home region, and the second change will be made both through the amendment tabled jointly with the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament – and I am grateful to Mr Gualtieri – and with a separate text aimed at ensuring a ‘clean Parliament’, as requested by the public. A ‘clean Parliament’ that prevents people who have received definitive sentences – and thus obtained all the guarantees of a fair trial – for extremely serious offences such as terrorism, corruption, organised crime, incitement to racial hatred, and so on from standing in elections. It is a disgrace that those guilty of such crimes should be able to sit in this House today. More courage is needed, ladies and gentlemen, and it is only with pioneering European rules that the European Parliament will obtain all the credibility it deserves. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the impression is that we are having difficulty bringing together all the possible instruments and making even small but tangible gestures. We have: political dialogue, trade policy, development coordination, immigration policies and humanitarian aid with separate managers, procedures and budget lines and sometimes Europe picks a card and uses the policy it likes the most, but we need to pursue every option to help whoever is most deserving and to update all the instruments. For example, trade with Egypt and Tunisia cannot continue with the same agreements for other countries in the region. A Mediterranean development bank is needed or, alternatively, the mandate of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could be extended, just as the European Investment Bank can finance small enterprises in Moldova or in Ukraine, but not in Egypt. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe reach the Caucasus and Central Asia, but there is no Mediterranean integration cooperation organisation. What initiatives do we intend to adopt in this direction? Is Parliament currently asking for a specific Erasmus programme for the Mediterranean and why is the Commission not rolling out this initiative immediately? An Arab employee of a multinational can obtain a visa for Europe, but a small Tunisian entrepreneur who wants to sign a contract cannot. High Representative, it is up to you not to waste any initiative and to consistently bring together all our actions from the many European Union bodies, otherwise, the change will take over and inspire the Mediterranean, but it will not have inspired us.

 Madam President, in addition to the opening of a delegation in Ulaanbaatar – something that we can no longer put off, not least because pursuing relations from Beijing is very bad for symbolic reasons – and in addition to the long-awaited partnership agreement, we are all aware both of the country’s mineral wealth and of its weaknesses in terms of social justice, even though Mongolia has, in its own way, developed a form of democratic cohesion. I would especially like to ask the Commission where Mongolia should be placed from a geostrategic point of view: it is not a country covered by the Central Asia strategy. I think, however, that some of the measures in this strategy could perhaps be extended to Mongolia, in view of its cultural history, which is similar to that of the other countries. The country also currently has observer status in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the European Union is examining the possibility of helping it become a full member, given the ancient cultural links that exist between Europe and Mongolia.

Madam President, it is difficult to oversee the final steps in the formation of a new country along a peaceful path. The ultimate objective – peace – must be safeguarded, but without losing significant pieces of the global agreement. Khartoum’s military action in Abyei appears to be jeopardising the good overall outcome of this journey, though not the founding of the 54th African state on 9 July. The South must not react to provocation and not lose sight of the final objective, which is not only independence but also the constitution of credible institutions and the advancement of its population, 90% of which lives below the poverty line. The people are unlikely to benefit from foreign investment, which already promises to be transparent and not predatory. I believe that this – the problem of foreign investment in South Sudan – will soon be a new front line that the European Union must monitor and on which it must assert the credibility it has earned in recent years in this region.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is something wrong about holding a debate in May 2011 on a natural disaster that occurred in summer 2010, a disaster that left 12 million people homeless and destroyed 20% of the country concerned. I do not support the socialist position, which was expressed by Mr Susta just now. It is partly due to this hesitation that we are still racking our brains trying to work out which instruments we can adopt in order to actively help Pakistan, and on top of our frustration at not having achieved that yet, we are also conscious that we need a trade policy approach that is more mature in political and humanitarian terms: trade policy must become one of the instruments for helping populations in difficulty. I admit that the Commission has acted swiftly and effectively by proposing a package of measures, which obviously needed to be discussed and rebalanced so that they did not penalise a European sector that has already been tested by the crisis. It is thanks to the work done by the Committee on International Trade, including that contained in certain amendments – among which the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports Amendment 37 – that businesses, too, can request application of the safeguard clause. However, it seems that these are bad times for Pakistan and that too many people are failing to face up to their responsibilities. We are asking India to change its attitude and to soften its ‘no’ stance at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as a tangible sign of good-neighbourly relations. True, relations are difficult between those two countries, since there was also the Mumbai attack and Pakistan’s poor cooperation in identifying and capturing the perpetrators of the attack. Yet that affair could be something that breaks the bad habits of a bad relationship between neighbours. We are also asking the Pakistani authorities for something, namely, to be more determined to consider this issue from a bilateral point of view in their relations with India. Bilateral meetings have recently taken place, though little has come of them, perhaps due to a pride issue on the Pakistanis’ part. It is clear that cricket diplomacy, emphasised by Pakistan’s Members of Parliament, whom we met just two weeks ago, has so far failed to produce meaningful results. Lastly, it is the WTO, above all, that we are asking – as we did in Geneva during the recent Interparliamentary Assembly – quickly to adopt mechanisms that will enable international trade rules to respond swiftly and flexibly to emergencies in a country hit by unforeseen disasters. This tariff reduction affair may end up achieving nothing, or it could open a new era in trade relations. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these negotiations are a little like the four-armed God Shiva, since it takes so much effort to conclude such a complex agreement. I am now going to explain the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Firstly: access to medicines. While I welcome the Commissioner’s statement, I confirm that I am against any attempt to implement protectionist measures in a sector in which Europe actually hindered access to low cost medicines in the past. Exploiting the issue of counterfeiting purely for protectionist purposes is about as low as it gets. The agreement should instead be an opportunity for the Indian and European pharmaceutical industries to cooperate with one another. Secondly: industrial sectors. We are asking India to allow sensitive sectors such as the automotive and alcohol sectors, in which our exports are today heavily taxed, to also feature in the agreement. Thirdly: agriculture. For our part, we declare ourselves willing to discuss agricultural products and to open up our market, but with a few conditions attached: obviously, we must say ‘no’ to GMOs and do everything we can to protect geographical indications. As regards this last aspect, I would remind you that geographical indications are not just a trade policy matter; they are also part of Europe’s identity. We therefore hope that a huge effort will be made to simplify registration procedures in India’s bureaucratic system, which is very onerous, perhaps even more onerous than the European one, which says it all. As regards public procurement, I congratulate the Commission if it is true that India seems to be prepared, for the first time, to include public procurement in an international agreement. Indian railways – to give you an example, 17 000 trains transport 18 million passengers every day, and there are plans to build a further 25 000 kilometres of track in the next 10 years – are one of the many markets that could potentially be opened up with this free trade agreement. If the negotiations go well, both parties will benefit: sustainable development will be promoted, child labour will gradually be eradicated and a more progressive form of social protection will be upheld. I feel it is pointless and detrimental to oppose this, and so I call on all the groups in Parliament to reject a priori
 a compromise text. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Schlyter for his excellent report on a sensitive issue on which a great deal of common sense is needed. Not all investment agreements can be replaced by European agreements, but not even the Commission can ignore agreements that infringe European provisions, and we agree with the rapporteur about placing the emphasis on transparency. Ideally, we should have a clause that automatically repeals the 1 200 agreements currently in force. Unfortunately, however, that would mean legal uncertainty for investors and too much work, perhaps, for the Commission. Our amendments in the Committee on International Trade have been successful, firstly, in ensuring that the Commission’s powers are fully respected and, secondly, in stating that legal certainty should be guaranteed. Some of the amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow in plenary may now alter this compromise and balance, and I call on my fellow Members, and the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs in particular, to come up with a balanced measure that is acceptable to all. Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for time immemorial, if there is one trade that is difficult to control, it is the arms trade. There are various ways to make this control difficult. One is to trade in apparently harmless weapons or techniques that can easily become a weapon, and that is why we are concerned with dual use in the regulation. Another difficulty is the plethora of rules that make any control system ineffective. When we started working on this case, the Commission asked us to amend a regulation dating from 2000. Meanwhile, this has been revoked and we were called on to amend the more recent 2009 regulation on the basis of the same obsolete proposal. We have just entered trialogue and we already have a new legislative proposal from the Commission, again to amend the regulation. The first request is therefore to establish clear, simple and transparent rules for European exporters having a consolidated text. Four points on the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). With regard to shipments of low value, we in the ALDE concur with the Council in being very sceptical about this system. Parliament has already limited the maximum value from EUR 5 000 to 3 000 and imposed various other criteria. The list of destination countries is very limited. This is something that small and medium-sized businesses legitimately want, but our main message is that we want security above all, as well as trade, and we must go back to work on this in the trialogue. We support the policy of ex ante notification and the obligation of registration by Member States. Finally, we demand the maximum degree of transparency to ensure that the regulation provides a mechanism which informs stakeholders, such as human rights or peace monitoring and trade unions organisations, of the various stages that made up the decision-making process, including through a report to the European Parliament Niccolò Rinaldi,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Generalised System of Preferences is one of the few methods of differentiation that works in favour of developing countries in international trade. It is a delicate instrument that must be used in the best way. Tonight we are talking about an extension, which means that the Commission date will be postponed once the new final proposal has been submitted. In the meantime, however, we are saying that this is a tool to be handled with caution, and that also applies to inter-institutional relations. Until now, even on the basis of the pre-Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament has not always been fully involved in decisions, as happened at the time of the discussions on Colombia or Sri Lanka that fired the enthusiasm of this House. We must also consider the merits of an ex-post
 evaluation of the decision to implement the regulation. What is the impact of the effects of a tariff reduction, what about its suspension, what are its mechanisms, what is its procedure? Sometimes an on-the-spot examination of these issues may reveal surprises and suggest the most relevant criteria to make the impact of the regulation as effective as possible. As far as the conditions are concerned, the world is changing and the instrument must show greater compliance with regard to those countries rewarded by the tariff concessions. The main concept of respect for human rights must be complemented by a broader vision in which, as noted by the rapporteur Mr Scholz – whom I thank for the excellent work he has done in this report – various indicators are taken into consideration: post-conflict rehabilitation, the specific situation of women, trade unions, the situation of recovery after natural disasters, environmental sustainability and compliance with international social agreements. If we were to adopt a combination of these criteria, I would not be surprised if the list of beneficiary countries we came up with were different from the current list and perhaps more deserving, but we will be able to talk about this again once we have the final proposal for a regulation.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you have already provided some information, Commissioner, but I would like more details. Firstly, the WTO. What exactly are we doing at the WTO concerning the initiative that was already taken in 2009 but which, as far as I know, concerned magnesium and bauxite? Do we have a procedure at the WTO regarding rare earths? Is such a procedure possible and do we initiate it alone, or can we initiate it together with the United States and Japan, as I think would be desirable? Secondly, you have said that we need to increase supplies from other deposits, including European ones. Is there a role for Greenland? What is the precise thinking in this respect? Thirdly, the recovery of rare earths from recycling. Are we moving towards a set of European rules on so-called urban mining? Will there be a directive or a regulation? What is planned in this respect? Fourthly, with regard to studies and investigation, the development of investigations, will we have some specific provisions in the Eighth Framework Programme also? Furthermore, with regard to the stockpiling system, will we have common European rules on stockpiling in this case, too? Finally, to what extent is the issue being dealt with bilaterally with China as part of the high-level economic and commercial dialogue and in the negotiations under way on the new partnership and cooperation agreement with that country?

 Mr President, Commissioner, this agreement contains a clause that does not convince us and has never convinced us. I am talking about the refund of customs duties that Korea will receive for imports of products from China or other countries. We have already discussed this, but as a liberal democrat I consider this measure to be deeply flawed. It is a kind of export subsidy, and I would like it if, when voting on this agreement, we had an assurance that this clause will not set a precedent and will not be included in any other future agreements. Tomorrow’s vote will conclude one leg of the journey we have undertaken together, but only one leg, because the relationship between Parliament and the Commission must continue, not least with regard to the actual implementation of the safeguard clause. For the sake of European industry and European workers, we cannot make any mistakes when implementing it, or else we will face great problems in future agreements. This is the Year of the Rabbit in the Far East, so I hope European industry will run like a rabbit, taking advantage of what this agreement can offer it. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start my speech with a statement supposedly made by the Italian Foreign Minister yesterday in Damascus, during which he said – listen to this – that Syria ‘is a stable country in which the population’s desire for modernisation has been satisfied’. Meanwhile, a few days ago, Italy’s Interior Minister made another statement in which he shifted his responsibilities to Europe, which has allegedly abandoned Italy ‘as usual’, he added with a hint of mischief. As usual, however, we are witnessing the habit of blaming Europe when it suits, only to ignore it irritably when Brussels disapproves of the agreement on sea repatriations, which violates humanitarian law and lines the pockets of African dictators – some of whom are today being toppled – and continuing even today to lavish billions on the Libya of Mr Gaddafi, or refusing EUR 10 million of aid offered to the Italian Government by the European Fund for Refugees, which Italy decided not to use, possibly because it would have to be spent in keeping with Europe’s transparent rules and not the in-house criteria of the Italian Civil Protection Agency. Therefore, I think that we will achieve nothing by acting like this and by making these declarations. The lesson of recent weeks has really not been learnt. Lampedusa reminds us that history is stronger than certain political games and recourse to declarations that create illusions. It reminds us that not everything can be bought with money, that Europe is not something that can be called upon when it suits, but is a project that must be committed to each day, demanding rights and solidarity but also respecting the commitments undertaken. In order to slow down migration in a sustainable and purposeful way, five things are needed: democracy, development, respect for international law, European solidarity and also, above all, no prejudicial rhetoric.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am a liberal democrat both in Europe and in Italy. Sometimes, however, in my country, my fellow party members and I are called communists merely for opposing the current government. It seems that the same thing is now happening to our colleagues in Bulgaria, with liberal democrats and socialists being called criminals simply because they represent an opposition force in their country. We disapprove of this move, because if it is a joke, then it really should only be a short one. Behaviour of this kind can become really dangerous in the end. In addition, after everything that has happened in Egypt and Tunisia, only yesterday, the Italian Foreign Minister visited Damascus in Syria and called it ‘a democratic country that completely satisfies its citizens’ need for modernisation’. If our representatives make speeches like this, it is our duty as Members of the European Parliament to denounce them and the Commission must keep a close watch. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I began working at the European Parliament as a political adviser in 1991 and at that time the conflict between northern and southern Sudan was already a recurring crisis. Finally, after 20 years, it seems we are seeing a bit of light at the end of a long, arduous tunnel. As Mr Milana and others have pointed out, much still needs to be done, but many of us were preparing for the worst and expecting the civil war to start up again. I therefore congratulate the north and south of the country on this initial referendum result. Every day counts now until the declaration of independence. No-one can allow themselves to put a foot wrong, either in Khartoum, in Juba, in Brussels or at the African Union in Addis Ababa. For example, the idea of opening an EU delegation with special status until the declaration of independence is definitely to be welcomed. Sudan is about to teach us,the international community, a wonderful lesson about cynicism and about crises that, more out of a sense of resignation than anything else, we often consider to be unsolvable.

 Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the fate of Eastern Christians is changing the map of cultures, with communities thousands of years old – ‘Copt’ means ‘Egyptian’ in Greek – now looking to emigrate overseas to escape from the violence they have been suffering. However, the media or xenophobic parties should not make the mistake of calling this a clash of religions or a clash of civilisations. I would like to recount a short incident that I find significant. Years ago in Cairo, an old man from the countryside who delivered milk to our house three times a week stood at our door crying. We could not understand what he wanted, as all he could say through his tears was ‘Said Akbar
, Said Akbar
,’ the great old man, the great old man. We eventually realised that he was showing his Christian customers his grief at the death of Karol Wojtyła, who had just passed away. This was a simple, sincere man, a Muslim who acted with all the ancient mutual respect of the Mediterranean peoples. This short but significant incident, reflecting widespread values in Egyptian society, happened in the same country in which the Copts were massacred at Christmas. Today, however, Eastern Christian communities need protection. They are sometimes trapped in the settling of scores between terrorists and fundamentalists and authoritarian powers. European foreign policy should not remain powerless while the world changes. It should not be afraid to say the word ... (The President cut off the speaker) Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it really is true that Haiti is a case apart, that it is different, because anniversaries of disasters are always commemorated in order to remember the victims, to learn from one’s mistakes and do better next time, but it is different in Haiti because there is nothing to remember – nothing has happened yet. Instead of saying one year after
 the earthquake, we should actually be saying one year of
 earthquakes, because there was the seismic earthquake, then the earthquake with regard to the shambolic aid distribution, then the health earthquake with the cholera outbreak, then the political earthquake with the non-transparent elections that were held at probably the worst possible time, and now the earthquake that is, in some respects, historical too, with the return of the former dictator in the guise of a dubious multi-millionaire tourist. The Commission is doing good work – very good work, in fact. I visited Haiti last June with the Committee on Development and I saw the excellent work being done, for which we thank the Commission. However, there needs to be greater political protection and an enhanced role for the international community, which must set targets and deadlines and must directly oversee part of the reconstruction. This must be balanced with the increased involvement of the population and local NGOs, which are often frozen out instead. A lesser role for the national politicians and national government institutions of Haiti, then, and a greater role for the so far fragile partnership between its citizens and the international community.

Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Côte d'Ivoire is a test case and a test case we cannot afford to fail. This applies to the European Union above all because there is no way we can acknowledge a stolen victory but neither is there any way we can stop exerting maximum pressure on the Ivorian leaders over this massive fraud. Furthermore, it will not be acceptable for a single euro from European taxpayers to end up in or even pass through an illegal government that disregards even the most elementary rules of democracy. Côte d'Ivoire must be made aware of this. Côte d'Ivoire is now also a test case for the African Union, which is dealing with the situation in a very interesting way, so far showing a degree of firmness and unity that would have been unthinkable only 10 or 15 years ago. This is a sign that the Ivorian affair should not be exploited to revive old stereotypes of black Africa being incompatible with democracy. Even though we hover on the brink of widespread violence, which would be catastrophic, Ivorian society is so far also passing this difficult test: it gave a majority to the reformist candidate Mr Outtara and appears to have learned the lesson of the great Ivorian writer Ahmadou Kourouma, who in 1998 published a book with the apt title ‘En attendant les votes des bêtes sauvages
’ (Waiting for the Wild Beasts to Vote), which tells this very story from a democratic and very Ivorian standpoint Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are only a few of us here this evening to talk about anti-dumping, which is, however, an issue we speak about a great deal in our own countries. I believe that there is no issue in international trade that business people, small and medium-sized enterprises, trade unions and consumers care more about than dumping. Dealing with dumping is basically a daily task for a large part of our productive economy. The Commission is working hard and is certainly doing its duty when it comes to anti-dumping initiatives, but we are calling for action based on the following principles. Firstly, transparency of action, full transparency of procedures, of the evaluation criteria adopted and their results, and then communications and a communications strategy, because the actions taken on anti-dumping by the European Commission can serve to reassure our business people and workers. Secondly, there is space for the exercise of discretion in anti-dumping procedures. This is common sense, but sometimes I have the impression that too much discretion is exercised in the decisions that are taken. Thirdly, following the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament must be better integrated, involved and informed. It seems to me that there the Commission is labouring somewhat to recognise Parliament’s role in international trade – even though much effort has been made, for which we are grateful to the Commissioner – and Parliament certainly needs to have a stronger voice on anti-dumping as well. Lastly, there is the question of dialogue with society. Once again, perhaps, the Commission still has much to do on this issue. Parliament cannot merely sit and listen to the players in society, including in anti-dumping matters. In this respect, the Commission should probably take note of the new requirements with respect to the exclusive powers on international trade recognised to it by the Treaty of Lisbon. Lastly, it is clear to us that anti-dumping must be part of a coherent commercial strategy and an integrated policy based on the criteria of honesty and openness. Bearing this in mind, Europe will be able to move forward with its head held high. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first the epicentre of a terrible earthquake, in precisely the poorest and worst-governed area in the American hemisphere, and now cholera in the country which receives one of the highest amounts of per capita international aid. What a contradiction! It is not just a terrible combination of bad luck: in Haiti, in the streets crowded with children and tents crammed in amongst the rubbish, no one knows where to begin. The local political class is often greedy and focused on power games rather than taking control of the reconstruction efforts, and the bureaucratic machine, decimated by the earthquake, has a weak administrative culture and, in some cases, has even obstructed the distribution of aid. There are many, often badly run, international organisations and, in fact, they have failed to protect the population. Visiting the country with the European Parliament delegation in June, the concentration of abandoned fields, rubble which had not been removed and rubbish already gave a clear indication of how bad the situation could become. Now cholera is here. The Commission and the Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) have so far done what was required, but they must now redouble their efforts. My feeling is that now, as well as strong recovery action, Haiti needs greater protection at the international political level. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today marks a fork in the road between two crucial principles. On the one hand, there is the duty of solidarity towards a country that has been hit by natural disasters, bringing its society, which already has structural problems, to its knees. On the other hand, there is the necessity for a balanced trade policy. With the European Commission’s proposal to suspend duties for Pakistan, the European Union is rightly avoiding a policy of mere humanitarian aid, allowing Pakistan to strengthen its economy and therefore its society. The fact that all 74 of the tariff lines involved relate to the textile and clothing sector is almost inevitable for a country that can export only products within this sector. We liberal democrats definitely prefer recourse to this kind of measure, rather than agreeing on humanitarian aid which is incapable of giving the country a genuine boost. However, as Mr Melo reiterated a short while ago, we must not be naive and we ask the Commission – above all – not to make the mistake of naivety. The Commissioner is well aware of the critical situation in which some textile districts, such as Prato, find themselves. Prato is a special case: The situation there has gone out of the control of the national authorities and there is widespread illegality, which is also exacerbated by the crisis in the European textiles sector. Since we believe that it cannot be just the European textiles sector that pays for our rightful humanitarian solidarity with Pakistan, we ask for three things to be done: 1) To set up regulatory instruments to avoid all possible triangulation with other countries that could profit from the duties from which Pakistan is benefiting; 2) Not to aggravate the crisis in the European textile sector, by implementing measures that could instead support it, such as a reduction in the cost of electricity; and 3) To avoid creating a precedent for other countries that suffer such natural disasters. By working in this way, I think the aid for Pakistan is shared and sustainable, including in the long term, and that is what that country needs. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Madam President, if you were to visit the Ponte Rialto
 in Venice – perhaps with Commissioner De Gucht – and wanted to buy a pair of shoes advertised as Italian, a tie, a traditional mask or a glass from Murano, there is a chance you will be ripped off, realising that the product purchased was not made in Italy at all, but in some country in Asia. I believe that the proposed regulation under discussion is beginning to inject some order into an ever more confused global market. It seeks to protect the consumer – including you Madam President, and Commissioner De Gucht, if you go shopping on Venice’s Ponte Rialto
, or elsewhere – as well as the European industries that have not relocated (whilst those that have will be penalised by this regulation). Above all it will correct the asymmetry on the trade markets, which sees Europe as the only large area lacking a regulation on compulsory origin marking. This is not a protectionist proposal; in fact, I find it to be very balanced. It only applies to a limited number of products, to the final product destined for the consumer, and – as far as my group is concerned – it is a 5-year pilot project because we shall support the amendment with the sunset clause. In addition, we also introduced in committee – through an amendment of my own – a provision that aims to avoid any excessive bureaucratic burden that would harm businesses. If the vote tomorrow is satisfactory, it will mean that one stage has been won, but it will not be a conclusive victory. We shall then need the full support of the European Commission in our dealings with the European Council. The Commission has already been full of suggestions and very cooperative, for which we are grateful, and this is a reason why we must continue to work together. I am sure that in five years, we shall be satisfied by the result we have obtained. Niccolò Rinaldi,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations have been difficult, with strong opposing opinions as well as different interpretations of the consequences of this agreement. As far I as can make out, the current status of the negotiations provides for an imbalance in the treatment of geographic indications and marks, in favour of the latter, as well as the failure to act, in violation of Article 22 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of International Property Rights, on marks that use denominations protected by geographical indications. ‘Parmesan’ – one of a number of possible examples – can be freely produced as ‘Parmesan’ in the United States and Australia and exported to China or elsewhere in direct competition with European products, one of the strengths of which is geographical indications. Consequently, European products seem to be propping up unfair competition without any effective protection from the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. I should like a clarification in this regard. ‘Parmesan’ means ‘from Parma’, not Australia or the United States, and this applies equally to all European geographic indications. We must be careful because if, in the course of 21st century globalisation, in a few years’ time, we no longer have our geographic indications, it will partly be because of today’s mistaken choices and we shall lose an enormous piece of our identity. In this regard, if all that were permitted by the ACTA, the agreement would be unacceptable. There is also the question of the Internet, as already mentioned. The European Union is in favour of a society of widespread knowledge, open to all, and the ACTA must not in any way constitute a restriction on the freedom of access to the Internet. Much has been gained on this issue. The Commissioner has given his important assurances, but it would be unacceptable if the acquis communautaire
 were tarnished, as still appears to be the case, by the possibility of legal injunctions provided for by Article 2, and by the possibility of criminal sanctions, including for individual users, as provided for by Article 2(14)(1). I appreciate the highly important assurances on access to medicine for developing countries, but we know that the list of countries adhering to the ACTA is very limited and excludes the great powers of counterfeiting, in Asia, in particular, but not only there. So for this reason, given everything we have to lose on geographic indications and risks on the Internet, the impression – for now – is that the agreement represents only a disadvantage and on this basis, perhaps it is better to let it drop.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs De Keyser has already said nearly all there is to say. I would like to dedicate this minute to a baby boy who I met on 1 December 2009 in Luanda, when we were in Angola for the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly. The baby boy was at the end of his life, he was dying due to malnutrition in his mother’s arms in the Divine Providence Hospital in the centre of Luanda, near the place where we were doing our work and near the stadium that was being built for the African Cup; in other words, he was surrounded by plenty. Yet this was not an isolated case: every day in Luanda, children are still dying of hunger, due to malnutrition, in the arms of their young mothers who have not been taught anything about nutrition and who are often left to their own devices. For a Christian, sights like this constitute a sin – a great sin; for a politician, they are a sign of the failure of our policies; and for the ruling class of that country, Angola, they are also a sign of greed and the unfair distribution of wealth. I believe the reasons why that child had such a fleeting existence on the earth give us much food for thought and I hope my testimony will contribute to this reflection. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a summit between China and the European Union is a model affair between two friends who have mutual reasons for satisfaction. In certain respects, they go back a long way, because Europe and China have both contributed to a safer and more prosperous world. Trade policy represents a crucial factor in this combined effort, even if something is not working properly, and even if it is true to say that over the last five years, the European trade deficit has tripled. This is not sustainable for the European Union but perhaps inevitable, due to China’s constant social and environmental dumping, its world record for counterfeit medicines, its market that is closed to services, its unwillingness to take part in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and its instinctive reaction to conduct a closed policy, even with regard to human rights: from the oppression of Tibet, which is culturally, spiritually and ethnically stifled, to this obstinate refusal to recognise the de facto sovereignty of Taiwan, the repression of freedom of expression in the media and on the Internet and the shameful systematic use of the death penalty. All this is old politics to us – and we are bound to say this to our Chinese friends – because why should we offend the intelligence of a people whose civilisation has always kept pace with the times? We have little to teach China. Quite the contrary: all the competitive clout wielded by the Chinese, including in trade policy, derives from the fact that China has 1.5 billion inhabitants and one Foreign Minister, 1.5 billion inhabitants and one fiscal policy, 1.5 billion inhabitants and one currency, and the Europe of 27 + 1, which constantly falters in its dealings with China, still has a lot to learn and must recover its unity.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, discussing the problems of sparsely populated areas and of the outermost islands in this Chamber – especially in the light of my parliamentary commitment to mountain regions – is the first step towards creating a network to preserve these regions, in which European citizens live in completely unique conditions and often on low incomes. These are sparsely populated areas with low population density in which there is a phenomenon of ageing populations, because the young people often leave, and a percentage of graduates that is below the national average. These criteria, particularly GDP, but there are others too, need to inspire a European support strategy for mountain regions, which have fewer services, infrastructure problems and which are particularly vulnerable due to the agricultural crisis and climate change. Mountains are places in which people live and which they study, and today they must also become a political laboratory, because they are an immense resource for cultural, clean energy and quality agriculture development, and for the quality of life that is indispensable for guaranteeing greater well-being among urban populations. Beyond the Commission, the Member States and the local authorities, it is the responsibility of local communities, too, to understand how to control their own destiny in 21st century Europe, with an integrated approach and especially active participation in decision making. I speak from experience when I say that in mountain regions, it is better to organise 10 local sporting events than one single World Cup, and this should be the working method for everybody: we should increase the number of widespread initiatives and demonstrate greater political creativity, starting with the creation within the College of Commissioners of a specific delegation for mountain regions and islands.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mr Kazak’s report which basically tells us that the European Union has a remarkable instrument in its hands to further develop its relations, including its political relations, with Turkey: the commercial policy. The crucial geo-strategic position of Turkey for the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Central Asia and the Caucasus has already been noted. There is a beautiful poem by the Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet which goes: ‘this country shaped like the head of a mare coming full gallop from far off Asia to stretch into the Mediterranean’. We would like the mare that is Turkey to be a true fulcrum of the relations with these regions, of which Turkey is one of their centres. However, to make this happen, political and trade relations with Armenia need to be stabilised, the Cyprus question needs to be closed, and I would highlight paragraph 11 of Mr Kazak’s report on the actuation and application of the customs union with regard to the part of Cyprus occupied by Turkey. So not everything is perfect. Mrs Balzani also pointed out that there are some problems, especially in the areas of counterfeiting, the defence and protection of intellectual property, and the application of the customs union to the services sector and to procurement. I would like to thank Mr Kazak. The Mediterranean is destined to change and we want to change it together with Turkey, which, according to the International Monetary Fund, is expected to experience growth of some 37% between now and 2020, which tells us all we need to know.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘acta est fabula, plaudite!
’ – ‘the play is over, applaud!’ – as Roman actors used to say at the end of a performance. The play is over and perhaps we are on the eve of its conclusion, although it may not yet be time to applaud. During this debate, we have been given important reassurances by Mr De Gucht, but we know that 64% of counterfeit goods come from China, which is not a party to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). We will therefore need to assess whether it is all worthwhile – in other words, whether we ought to sign the agreement if it does not bring any real benefits, as the Commissioner concluded. There are not many causes of concern remaining, but they are significant. A lot has been said about the Internet, and we appreciate the Commission’s efforts, but we remain vigilant. As regards access to medicines, I repeat what has already been demanded by other Members: there can be no lumping together of counterfeit medicines on the one hand and generic medicines on the other. It is vital to allow access to medicines at competitive prices, which are crucial for patients in developing countries. The question I should like to ask is whether the Doha declaration on the TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement and public health will be included at least in the preamble of the ACTA text. Lastly, as regards geographical indications, we find ourselves in a potentially paradoxical situation, because registered trademarks that might violate geographical indications would enjoy greater protection than the geographical indications themselves. Here, too, TRIPS provides a sounder basis in many respects, and we therefore call for vigilance and a firm stance. Niccolò Rinaldi  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are a little like the Ryong, the dragons of Korean mythology, which are gentle, benevolent but highly determined dragons. We are also aware that we are the European institution that is directly elected by our citizens, and we therefore call for an effective safeguard clause. Parliament is willing to conclude the agreement at first reading, but on condition that there are concrete proposals taking account of the interests of European workers and industries and especially of Parliament’s institutional prerogatives. We have six demands, which have already been put forward in part by other Members. The first one is no provisional implementation before the safeguard regulation has been adopted and before Parliament has given the agreement its approval. The second is a regional or, in any case, a flexible safeguard clause, because Europe is diverse and it is important for the agreement to be accepted and welcomed by its various stakeholders. The third and even more important demand concerns Parliament’s role in the procedures: the right to call an investigation – we have, of course, asked to extend this right to industry – the right to be given full information, and access to the online platform. The fourth concerns comitology in implementation of the regulation: the Council cannot have a greater role than Parliament. We insist on Parliament having a strong role, with a procedure – the advisory procedure – providing for a veto in cases where the Commission decides not to apply measures after an investigation. Fifthly, with regard to customs duty drawback, customs duties must be included in the safeguard clauses and must be one of the factors in any investigation and monitoring. Lastly, the sixth demand is that there needs to be monitoring of social and working conditions and environmental standards, and there needs to be a level playing field putting the Koreans and Europeans on an equal footing as regards CO2
. We are fully in favour of this Free Trade Agreement and of any Free Trade Agreement that is an instrument for stability and peace. Nobody, however, should be naive about its content, nor can the Council ignore Parliament’s role. Niccolò Rinaldi,

 Madam President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we do not want any more pogroms in Central Asia. Central Asia is a region that presents a high risk of interethnic conflicts. The peoples are very mixed, and the borders were drawn up under the Stalinist regime. Just consider that Kyrgyzstan has a Kyrgyz exclave in Uzbek territory, and there are four Uzbek enclaves in Kyrgyz territory, including one that is inhabited exclusively by Uzbek citizens living in Kyrgyzstan who are of Tajik nationality – this shows the complexity of the situation. We now have 300 000 people who are displaced. One hundred thousand people have taken refuge in Uzbekistan and very many have died: we do not even know how many, possibly even 2 000. What can be done? First of all, as the Commissioner stated, it is very important to guarantee justice, because – as the experience of other countries demonstrates – there can be no reconciliation without a form of justice. Therefore, we need to persevere with this committee of inquiry. The second point: while continuing to provide humanitarian aid, we also need to deal with a number of political issues. Mr Swoboda mentioned one, namely, that we must confirm to this interim government that it is, in fact, doing a good job. The referendum was a success not only from the point of view of its content, because it redresses the balance of the relationship between the Presidency and the parliament, but also because of the way in which it was organised and because of its high turnout. I would also like to understand how we Europeans should respond, if we do respond, to the OSCE request to send international police forces: shall we leave policing entirely up to the Russians, or will there also be a European contribution? The third point: what is the United States doing? It has a very large military base in Manas, but it seems to me that US influence in Central Asia is declining in general. I think it is important for us to harmonise certain issues with the US Administration as well. As for the 27 July donors’ conference mentioned by the Commissioner, I would like to understand what Europe’s priorities are here. I believe that we need to invest, above all, in education and in strengthening the civil society that exists in Kyrgyzstan. It is active, as the high turnout at the referendum showed. I would like to conclude by emphasising that the European strategy of taking a regional approach to Central Asia is certainly the right one. This is a region that needs to be considered in its entirety. I think that in the medium term, we will gradually need to apply this strategy to Afghanistan, too, because we cannot have one policy for Afghanistan and another for the countries of Central Asia – for the other countries of Central Asia. This is a paradigm case for the prevention of conflict, a little like what EU-FAST turned out not to be for Haiti, through the coordination of civil and emergency protection. We now have the legal instruments: the citizens wanted them, and we need to prove that we are up to the challenge. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I am in favour of this proposal because it aims to bring the new psychoactive substances under the same criminal law provisions as other substances controlled under the UN conventions. Psychoactive substances, like many other drugs, are a threat to society, affecting the functioning of the brain which creates symptoms such as changes in consciousness, behaviour and cognition. Tackling the distribution of psychoactive substances is not to be underestimated. Though Member States do have their own policies on tackling illicit drugs, when psychoactive substances are being distributed from one Member State to another efficient cooperation between Member States is indispensable, especially in an era when commerce and communication are no longer limited by physical and geographical boundaries.

 I support this proposal as it empowers the Union to take steps to protect cultural national treasures, in the context of the opening-up of the Union’s internal borders. This acknowledges the need to provide cultural objects special protection in the light of the rules governing the internal market. In addition this proposal aims to improve cooperation between the national authorities responsible for matters related to the return of cultural objects. For this reason it is proposing that authorities should make use of a new EU administrative cooperation instrument: the Internal Market Information system (IMI). The IMI is an electronic tool designed to improve communication and cooperation between the authorities of the Member States in the context of the implementation of internal market legislation. That will make it possible to share information about national treasures and stolen cultural objects, it will provide secure internet access, and will be used in all the EU official languages.

 I am in favour of this report because it aims to ensure the efficient monitoring of the crossing of external borders. It is fundamental to set strict rules for the search and rescue operations and on the identification of migrants intercepted at sea in order to enable Frontex to respond more effectively and to prevent deaths at sea. The “operational plan” governing Frontex-coordinated border surveillance operations must henceforth include procedures to ensure that persons needing international protection, victims of trafficking in human beings, unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable persons are identified and given appropriate help. Furthermore, through the sea operation, the participating units will address the special needs of children, victims of trafficking, persons in need of urgent medical assistance, disabled persons, persons in need of international protection and other persons in a particularly vulnerable situation throughout the sea operation.

 I support this report, because I believe in the importance of improvement of transparency and predictability of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations. The parties affected by the imposition of provisional anti-dumping and countervailing measures, in particular, importers should be made aware of the imposition of such measures. This proposal aims at modernising both the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations, entails four central changes: the removal of the lesser duty rule in anti-dumping cases where structural raw material distortions are present and in all anti-subsidy cases, the obligation for Union producers to cooperate in ex-officio investigations, the reimbursement of duties collected during expiry reviews, and the two weeks' notice before provisional duties are introduced, commonly referred to as the shipping clause. The Commission’s rationale is based on three objectives: to increase the effectiveness of the instruments, to reduce the threat of retaliation from third country, and to increase transparency and predictability.

 I voted in favour of this proposal because the fraud and related illegal activities affecting the Union’s financial interests pose a serious problem to the detriment of the Union budget and thereby the taxpayers. For this reason we call to the European institutions to ensure that public money is devoted to structural growth, fiscal consolidation and jobs. There are differences among the Member States legal and sanctioning systems. This fragmented legal framework creates incentives, for the potential perpetrators, to move across the European territory to the most favourable judicial system. I believe we should respond with a unique voice to fraud and any other activities affecting the financial interests of the Union through deterrent measures. I consider this proposal for a directive on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interest also as an important step in the field of EU Criminal Law. This area has been significantly enhanced since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and should be used to the fullest extent. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this proposal because with this text we lay down provisions for the European Parliament to set up temporary committees of inquiry to investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Community law. I consider it is of fundamental importance to guarantee inquiry committees the possibility to request documents, to summon witnesses, to hear officials and other servants of the Union or of Member States and to request experts’ reports when necessary to carry out investigations. However I believe that Parliament should lead the way in ensuring that the inquiry committee remains independent. For this reason it should closely monitor the impartiality and discretion of the examination and assure transparency and accountability throughout the investigation process. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted for this report as the development of relations between European Parliament and national parliaments is of essential importance. The resulting exchange of information is enabling the national parliaments to provide the EP with sounder evaluations and the EP to adopt decisions on the basis of broad consensus. This is ought to make it easier for European provisions to be transposed into national law rapidly and effectively by the national parliaments. Another important aspect is the so-called 'European mainstreaming' within the national parliaments, where European awareness can be achieved much more effectively by the national parliaments than by the European Parliament.

 I support this report in order to further elevate EU-Japan relations through the timely conclusion of the negotiations of a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement. Japan has been an EU strategic partner since 2003 and since has already cooperated in a number of fields such as customs cooperation and legal assistance in criminal matters, science and technology, internet security, academic and research cooperation, the peaceful use of nuclear energy, business community contacts and the promotion of people-to-people links. Moreover, the further enhancement of EU-Japan relations will aim at providing a long-standing framework for a closer relationship contributing considerably to the deepening of political, economic and cultural relations with tangible results for the citizens of both regions.

 I voted for this report as I believe we need to support the financial institutions of the Republic of Tunisia in order to sustain the population and strengthen their path onto democracy. Thanks to the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, Tunisia was the first Mediterranean country to enter in a free trade area with the Union. Unfortunately Tunisia's economy has been significantly affected by the "Arab Spring" and by the regional unrest that followed, particularly in neighbouring Libya. These events and the weak global economic environment, in particular the recession in the euro area, Tunisia's main trading and financial partner, has had a very negative impact on the Tunisian economy, leading to a slowdown in growth and generating large external and budgetary financing gaps. For this reason I think that the Union's macro-financial assistance will aim to support the restoration of a sustainable external financing situation of the country thereby supporting its economic and social development.

 I backed this proposal because I believe that the objectives of the European Maritime Fisheries Fund are to boost innovation, help communities diversify their economies, finance projects that create new jobs and improve the quality of life along the European coast.

 I voted for this report because I believe that the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership Programme will accelerate the clinical development of effective, safe and affordable medical interventions for poverty-related diseases. There is a need to develop partnership with developing countries such as sub-Saharan Africa to tackle the negative impacts of poverty-related diseases which affect 1 billion people. Moreover, given the humanitarian aspect of this important sector we need to make sure that the best possible outcomes are achieved. Therefore, coordinating closely with other organisations from public, private and voluntary sectors is also vital, not only to maximise the investments of Members States but also to minimise overlap and duplication.

 I voted against this report because although I support completely the need to urge Russia to undertake a credible, thorough and independent investigation into Sergei Magnitskyʼs death in pre-trial detention, and to bring all those responsible to justice, I believe that ordering a visa restriction for people not condemned by a tribunal would be inconsistent with our own legal standards.

With this text we reiterate our full support for the International Criminal Court and we urge the EU to continue fighting against the use of the death penalty and to strongly support the moratorium as a step towards abolition. As for bilateral relations between EU and UN, it is essential to support actively a comprehensive reform of the United Nations system, and especially its Security Council, in order to strengthen its legitimacy, regional representation, accountability and effectiveness.

 I voted for this report because the European Consensus on Development remains the most comprehensive basis for Union development cooperation. It sets out common objectives and principles for development and underlines the Union’s commitment to poverty eradication. The European Year for Development will also act as a catalyst for EU support by raising awareness through political public debate, building momentum and exchanging best practices between Member States, local and regional authorities and civil society. It will help foster a sense of joint responsibility and solidarity among Europeans and people in developing countries. Combating global poverty is not only a moral obligation, it will also help to build a more stable and peaceful world, reflecting the interdependence of richer and poorer countries. The Lisbon Treaty has firmly anchored development policy within Union external action in support of the Union’s interest in a stable and prosperous and more equitable world. Development policy also helps address other global challenges and contributes to the EU-2020 Strategy. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this proposal because I believe it is important that Member States get appropriate instruments to ensure the effective exercise of the Union’s rights in international trade agreements. In my opinion this is a highly important piece of legislation which will streamline the EU’s ability to act quickly and more efficiently, with measures to enforce its trading rights coming from dispute settlement decisions. I believe that in a global context where the number of retaliatory trade actions is increasing the mere existence of this recommended regulation will present a credible threat and will hopefully dissuade our trading partners from not respecting the rules of the game.

 I voted in favour of this resolution because I strongly believe that both internal political developments in Iran and the interim agreement on the nuclear issue have opened a great window of opportunity both for reforms within Iran and an improvement in its external relations with the EU. Most of all I am particularly satisfied because with this text we call for a more independent EU policy towards Iran. We also urged the Council to start a discussion on the relief of the nuclear-related sanctions. In addition I believe that Iran should be involved in the discussions for finding a solution for the Syrian crisis. On the other hand, I consider it important that, besides the nuclear deal, various topics including human rights and regional security need to be discussed between the EU and Iran. In this resolution we express our grave concern regarding the human rights situation in Iran, in particular the widespread allegations of torture, unfair trials and the high number of executions in 2013 and 2014.

 I fully support the creation of an Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund because it will offer support to Member States to identify, share and promote best practices and to establish effective cooperation in the framework of the Common European Asylum System.

 I am strongly against this resolution because its text consists of a series of attacks on Russia with the tone and language of the Cold War. This will only help to inflame the debate and to destabilise Ukraine. The resolution ignores the fact that half of Ukraine is pro-Russian and Russian-speaking and has no plans whatsoever to join the EU or NATO. To oblige Ukraine to make a choice between the EU and Russia means splitting the country and encouraging its dissolution. I believe that threatening Russia with sanctions, without leaving space for political dialogue and negotiation, is completely irresponsible. In addition I am astonished by the reckless decision of the Commission and the European Council to allocate a huge sum, EUR[nbsp ]11 billion, just for a couple of years, in favour of Ukraine. We do not have such money. And we cannot trust to have it back from a corrupt country on the brink of bankruptcy. We did not ask for any prior commitment by the Ukrainian Government in the fight against corruption, nor did we explore alternative financial aid possibilities, such as recovery of the assets of the Ukrainian oligarchs that are hidden in European banks.

 I am in favour of this report because it acknowledges that the revelations concerning the US NSA surveillance programme since June 2013 have profoundly shaken the trust between the two transatlantic partners and the trust between citizens and their governments. These revelations also undermined the confidence of members of the public in the functioning of democratic institutions on both sides of the Atlantic. With this text we strongly condemn the vast and systemic blanket collection of the personal data of random people, often including intimate personal information. It is important to make it clear that the systems for indiscriminate mass surveillance by intelligence services constitute a serious interference with the fundamental rights of citizens. Privacy is not a right that is a luxury, but is the foundation stone of a free and democratic society. In addition mass surveillance has potentially severe effects on freedom of the press, thought and speech and on freedom of assembly. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

For these reasons I am deeply concerned at the recent developments in Turkey with regard to allegations of high-level corruption. With this text we strongly regret the removal of the prosecutors and police officers in charge of the original investigations, as this goes against the fundamental principle of an independent judiciary and deeply affects the prospects for credible investigations. I consider regrettable the serious breakdown of trust between the government, the judiciary, the police and the media. Therefore, it is fundamental to urge Turkeyʼs Government to show full commitment to democratic principles and to refrain from any further interference in the investigation and prosecution of corruption.

 Mr President, I believe the discussion today is an opportunity to call on the UN Human Rights Council to follow up the implementation of the UN Secretary-General’s recommendations on the protection of human rights in Western Sahara. Morocco, as a new member of UNHRC, should acknowledge the right of the Sahrawi people to self-determination in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions and should put an end to the ongoing violation of human rights of the Sahrawi people. Also, I believe that Morocco should urgently release all Sahrawi political prisoners. For these reasons, I would like to ask all colleagues to vote in favour of all the amendments on Western Sahara proposed by the political groups.

 I support this report because this new directive will improve the legislation which prevents the conversion of the proceeds of criminal activity into legitimate funds via the financial system. To be able to do that, the operations of business registers have to be improved. Indeed, the identification of the beneficial owner of the business or the business transaction is crucial in preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. We must bear in mind that massive flows of illicit money damage the stability and reputation of the financial sector and threaten the single market as well as international development. I am persuaded that, in addition to the criminal law approach, a preventive effort via the financial system can produce results. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Mr. President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I share the view that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is an influential political, economic and religious actor in the Middle East and the Islamic world. It is also the world’s leading oil producer and an important partner for the EU. Nonetheless, we cannot ignore that KSA is the only country in the world in which women are not allowed to drive. With this text we call on the KSA authorities to eliminate all restrictions on women’s human rights, freedom of movement, health, education, marriage, employment opportunities, legal personality and representation in judicial processes, and all forms of discrimination against women in family law and in private and public life. Also, we ask Saudi Arabia to define a minimum age for marriage and take steps to ban child marriage in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which were both ratified by KSA.

 I voted in favour of this report, because with this text we stressed the importance of concentrating EU public funding in important areas such as job creation, SMEs, employment, education, research, innovation and sustainable transport. This report underlines the weaknesses of control over the funds and proposes improvements, such as the need to strengthen the transparency of reporting and the quality of programming. Moreover it stresses the importance of analysing the cause of the low absorption rates of the resources, a very well-known problem which is severely damaging the southern regions of Italy, for example.

 I backed this report because I believe that this agreement is an opportunity to strengthen the political dialogue and economic cooperation between the European Community and the Central American countries.

 I backed this report because this agreement is a good opportunity to strengthen the political dialogue and the economic cooperation between the European Community and the Republic of Indonesia. I also believe that this agreement, as the first of its kind between the EU and ASEAN countries, will open a new era in bilateral relations in that area of the world. I am particularly content that the agreement contains the commitments from both parties to the principles of democracy, good governance and the rule of law. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I have two questions for Commissioner Füle. First, I appreciated the most recent position taken by Baroness Ashton on the Ukraine-EU-Russia relationship. She says that the crisis in Ukraine was wrongly perceived as a confrontation between East and West, when the reality is that of a convergence and a synergy. Baroness Ashton accepts the concept of a Eurasian integration process where Russia and the EU cooperate in the creation of a common area of trade, stability and peace. My question is: why insist on keeping two systems of customs union alive, instead of creating just one free-trade zone?  Secondly, the Ukrainian Parliament is proposing to have in a new government three ministers who belong to the Svoboda Party, which is a neo-Nazi, anti-Semitic entity. What do you intend to do to maintain coherence with your past position on the inclusion of the Haider party in the Government of Austria? Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Mr[nbsp ]President, I am listening here to a long list of horror stories about Iraq. A few of my colleagues have mentioned what was a major origin of the horror, namely the war – one of the most stupid, expensive and useless wars of the last decades, waged in the name of exporting democracy and defending us from threats that did not exist. So, since this is a time when many of us would like Europe to play an increasing role in the world, with more intervention, accomplishing more and better things on all fronts, I would simply like to remind my colleagues that once the cameras have gone, once the spotlight has shifted, the problem may be that democracy is not there in the way that you expected. You have to contribute to rebuilding a country which is very hard to rebuild, and you have to address all the problems that are now apparent. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 This Parliament is taking a very important position on the issue of the use of armed drones. The resolution agreed upon is the first step towards the total prohibition of the use of this horrible weapon.  If there is one reason to forbid forever the use of drones it is simply the fact that they are a new weapon. We received a Nobel Prize for peace, and one of the main points is this: stop inventing new weapons; stop using technology and science to invent new weapons. So I am really surprised by all these limitations that are put by some colleagues on this issue. International law prohibits arbitrary killings, and this should be the main reason, in addition to what I have already said, for having a firm position against this new weapon. So I hope that this resolution will be the first step towards a total ban on this weapon. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted for this report because the proposal for a new legislation on confiscation of the proceeds of crime was strongly advocated by this Parliament. Thanks to this directive, Member States will have common rules for the freezing and confiscation of criminal assets through direct confiscation, value confiscation, extended confiscation, non-conviction-based confiscation and third-party confiscation. This will harmonise the EUʼs freezing and confiscation regimes, facilitating mutual trust and effective cross-border cooperation. Most of all, it will also constitute a step towards strengthening the mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders which is an important aspect of the fight against cross-border serious and organised crime in the EU.

 I voted for this report because I support the creation of the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps. The Corps will fill the gaps which currently exist in humanitarian volunteer work, and will also help to cultivate public awareness and the idea of EU citizenship. I believe the EU Aid Volunteers will provide genuine added value for the EU’s humanitarian action. It is important to stress that the role of the volunteers must be clearly defined and that the EU Aid Volunteers initiative should be an entirely humanitarian instrument supplementing and enhancing the EU’s humanitarian action, with the best possible use of the funding provided.

 I fully support the creation of this regulation because, as the economic crisis is exacerbating poverty and social exclusion across the Union, we must take tangible actions to alleviate the needs of the most deprived persons. In fact the aim of this Fund is to establish a new, broader instrument, able to relieve the most severe forms of poverty such as food and material impoverishment. Although the budget for the Fund is still far from being enough, nonetheless it does have the potential to play an important role ensuring the predictability of the support, which is essential for the charities and civil society organisations. I also believe that it is important to stress that this kind of fund should remain a complement to national policies, as the obligation to combat and eliminate poverty remains the responsibility of Member States.

 I voted against this resolution because I could not agree less with its approach to the Ukrainian crisis. Ukraine is not an EU protectorate. It is a sovereign country with a freely elected parliament. We should stop telling them what kind of government they should have, what kind of constitution they should adopt, and when and how to hold elections. It is not the European Union’s business to ‘liberate’ Ukraine or to take sides in its political process. It is ridiculous to ask Russia to stop retaliatory measures against Ukraine and, at the same time, to threaten EU sanctions if it does not follow our diktat. I believe that the latest events in Ukraine show, instead, the need for a thorough review of the Eastern Partnership project. This policy should be redesigned with a view of including Russia in its scope and not antagonising a country which is not an enemy – because Russia is part of Europe and should be treated accordingly.

 I support this resolution because it expresses our deep concerns over the devastating effects of the violent crisis in Syria, which has resulted in mass suffering for the population, and which constitutes a major threat to stability and security in the entire Middle East region and beyond.

 I support this resolution as I believe that Europe should focus its attention on the quality of institution-building. European efforts should all be aimed at strengthening the rule of law and bolstering institutions and economic reform in Egypt. Asset recovery is of primary importance in this respect.

 I voted for this resolution because it calls once again on the Council to set a date for the start of EU accession talks with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

 I voted for this resolution, which endorses the Commission’s communication entitled ‘Towards the elimination of female genital mutilation’. With this tool, EU funding to prevent female genital mutilation (FGM) and to improve support for victims will be increased. FGM is a brutal practice which does not occur only in third countries but also affects women and girls living in the EU and constitutes a clear violation of fundamental rights. For this reason we call, via with this resolution, on the Member States to use all existing mechanisms to pursue, prosecute and punish any resident who has committed the crime of FGM, even if the offence was committed outside the borders of the Member State concerned.

 I support this report because it explicitly recognises undocumented women migrants as a vulnerable social group exposed to trafficking, discrimination and exploitation on the labour market.

 I strongly support the ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty by the Member States because it establishes the first global regulation for trade in conventional weapons and, to some extent, in ammunition and parts and components. The ATT will prevent the illegal trade of weapons, international terrorism and organised crime and will limit serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. The strongest point of the ATT is that state parties are obliged to establish a national control system for these transfers and to evaluate, before authorising any transfer, the risk that these arms might impair peace and security or could be used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law or human rights. It is also important that not only trade of arms but other acts such as rental, licensing, grants and transfers of relevant technology also fall under the prohibition. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Mr President, I believe that in the last few days Ukraine has shown up a need for a deep review of our Eastern partnership project. The major flaw of our Eastern policies is their anti-Russian, Cold War profile. This policy should be redesigned with a view to including a rational approach and not antagonising a country which is not an enemy; because Russia is part of Europe and should be treated accordingly.  Another major blunder is our excessive interference in Ukrainian political affairs. Ukraine is not an EU protectorate; it is a sovereign country with a freely-elected parliament. We should stop telling them what kind of government they should have, what kind of constitution they should adopt and when and how to have a political election.   It is not the European Union’s business to liberate Ukraine and to take sides in its political process. It is ridiculous to ask Russia to stop retaliatory measures against Ukraine yet at the same time threaten EU sanctions if Ukraine does not follow our agenda. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, it is time for the EU to stop taking sides and positions at every political turn in the Egyptian transition. Europe should focus its attention on the quality of institution-building. Therefore, our efforts should all be directed at strengthening the rule of law and bolstering institutions and economic reform. To that end, I attach primary importance to major issues such as asset recovery. The restitution of frozen assets is – over and above its economic significance – a strong signal against the impunity for corruption and money laundering that has so far been enjoyed by unscrupulous political leaders in Egypt and elsewhere. I would reiterate that the only way to build a sustainable democracy in Egypt is by following the path of national reconciliation and inclusive political process. Any ban, exclusion or repression directed against any political force or actor in Egypt repeats past mistakes and leads only to increased radicalism. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this proposal, which will significantly reduce bureaucracy and remove yet another obstacle to a truly transnational and borderless European Union. The regulation aims to fulfil the very important role of making formalities easier for citizens who move across borders. A large number of EU citizens live in a Member State other than their own, and this number is steadily increasing. However, administrative formalities across borders are generally considerably more complicated than within each Member State. For this reason this text aims to simplify the cross-border recognition of public documents and to reduce the number of documents needing certified translation. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 I voted in favour of this resolution because it reiterates our full support against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. Since January 2011, the European Parliament has made this request ten times in various resolutions, asking the European Commission to produce a roadmap against homophobia.

I voted for this regulation because Hercule III will develop activities at Union and Member State level to counter fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union.

I fully support this motion because wildlife crime constitutes a threat to the welfare of the animals and to the conservation of the animal and plant species concerned, putting the local ecosystems as a whole at risk. Furthermore, illicit wildlife trafficking often involves transnational organised criminal networks and is used as a source of revenue with an annual turnover of at least USD 19 billion. This is why tackling wildlife crime requires a coordinated global response at the highest political level and between enforcement agencies. Moreover, an EU plan of action against wildlife crime and trafficking needs to be established and effective judicial systems developed in order to better combat this crime at local, national and regional level.

I voted for this resolution because, although equality should be a fundamental principle in the European Union, there is still discrimination concerning the access to the healthcare system. As a matter of fact, the healthcare system is in many cases restricted as a result of financial constraints. I do believe that the eHealth system could play a key role in reducing these inequalities. Nonetheless, Member States must invest in affordable, high-quality health systems. Moreover, some patients are obliged to undergo medical treatment outside their country of residence and this is not acceptable. Also, I would like to highlight that every citizen should have the opportunity to use IT tools or the skills needed to take advantage of eHealth services and we have the duty to make this possible.

I voted for this report because it is necessary to regain consumer confidence in the single market for foods, as the agri-food sector is one of the biggest sectors in the EU economy, providing 48 million jobs and worth EUR 715 billion annually. I would like to point out the importance of inspections and the effectiveness of unannounced inspections, which should be made regular and mandatory by Member States. Additionally, there is a need for Member States to improve coordination between different health authorities, given that a lack of adequate information exchange often paves the way for dishonest actors in the supply chain.

I voted for this resolution because I believe that labour inspection plays an important role in protecting employees’ rights. It is the responsibility of companies to ensure legal working conditions but unfortunately they do not always do so. Irregularly employed workers suffer from consequences such as the fear of having an accident or being caught, which in turn affects the productivity of companies and the economy as a whole. We need to win the fight against unsafe working environments. Also, in this time of economic crisis, undeclared work has negative consequences for Member States’ economies and creates social and financial insecurity. For all these reasons, all Member States must commit to taking the necessary measures on this issue at national level. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I support this resolution because it stresses the need for the EU and its Member States to honour their commitments to fulfil the ‘aid effectiveness agendaʼ. The Treaties give the EU the legal basis to strengthen the coherence and the effectiveness of the EUʼs external action and the only obstacles to this are lack of political will and bureaucracy. It is vital that more effective coordination is achieved by the EU and its Member States through joint programming, including domestic division of labour in order to avoid overlapping of actions and high transaction costs. Moreover there is a clear need to undertake a careful analysis of each recipient countryʼs specific needs, while ensuring that projects financed are embedded in the local economy and benefit those most in need.

In addition, I believe that a new EGF criterion with the wider eligibility scope signifies a more precise answer to market needs. Indeed the new EGF will now include: small and medium enterprises, the self-employed, workers with non-standard employment contracts and farmers. On top of that I completely agree with the importance of softening the stringent conditions imposed by the application procedure. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

The newly created South Sudan is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 50 % of the population living below the poverty line. Also, having emerged from a war and being located in an unstable region, it is in danger of failing if the international community and local stakeholders fail to cooperate in developing a joint strategy to turn it into a democratic and inclusive state.

Madam President, as a shadow rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Instrument, I would like to congratulate Mr Kukan for the huge effort and the result obtained during these difficult negotiations. With this instrument we finally have a good tool for implementation of the neighbourhood policy, especially with regard to the principle of a partnership of societies. More specifically, I hope this instrument will provide a good base for rebuilding our Eastern Partnership. The previous debate demonstrated what the major flaw of our eastern policy was: its anti-Russian profile and its cold-war and clash of civilisations inspiration.

Madam President, Morocco invaded and militarily occupied the territory of Western Sahara and has no legal title to dispose of Western Sahara’s natural resources. The EU should not be an accomplice to a colonial robbery.  If Morocco and the Commission had intended to take into account the reason behind Parliament’s rejection of the fisheries agreement, they would have included in it the need for Morocco to give to the Sahrawi people the revenues coming from the exploitation of their waters. Otherwise they could have excluded from the agreement the waters of Western Sahara, following the example of the US Congress and US Government, which do not include Western Sahara in any economic agreement with Morocco. None of that has happened. The text of the agreement contains only a generic and hypocritical reporting obligation for the Kingdom of Morocco on respect for human rights in international law. Morocco does not have the slightest credibility in this regard as it continues to practice torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, along with targeted assassination and political persecution in the occupied territories.

For this reason I believe that this is the right context to discuss about the on-going violation of human rights in Western Sahara. As neighbours and partner countries, we must urge Morocco to continue negotiations for a peaceful and long-lasting solution of the Western Sahara conflict. The Sahrawi people have the right to self-determination through a democratic referendum, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.

The EU should do everything possible to save the lives of people in danger. For this reason with this resolution we welcome the intention of the European Commission to establish a task force on the issue of migratory flows in the Mediterranean. In addition the EU must continue to offer humanitarian, financial and political assistance in crisis areas in North Africa and the Middle East in order to tackle migration and humanitarian pressures at their root cause.

In addition the EU must continue to offer humanitarian, financial and political assistance in crisis areas in North Africa and the Middle East in order to tackle migration and humanitarian pressures at their root cause. But Most of all, the Member States must respect the principle of non-refoulement, in compliance with existing international and EU law. Also, Countries like Italy, Greece and Spain must immediately put an end end to any improper and extended detention practices in violation of international law. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I voted for this resolution because I totally support the request to suspend the Agreement between the European Union and the US on the processing and transfer of Financial Messaging Data for the purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. I strongly believe that any transfer of personal data must comply with EU and Member State law and with fundamental rights obligations, including those relating to privacy and data protection. For this reason, given the reports of several newspapers, whereby documents were revealed that the NSA would have had access to the SWIFT banking data outside the framework of the EU-US TFTP agreement, I believe that the EU should urgently deliberate carefully on the human rights implications of any future data exchange alternatives which fully respect data protection principles, especially the necessity and proportionality test.

I fully support this report because it strengthens the control of trade in drug precursors, especially of acetic anhydride which is often used for the illicit production of heroin.  It is very important to create an EU system of licensing and registration capable of monitoring the trade of substances which are widely used in various legitimate industrial processes, but which can also be misused by criminals. The harmonisation of licencing requirements across the EU is essential for the prevention of market fragmentation and illegal transactions. In addition I hope that effective EU action in this field will encourage other regions in the world to follow the EU’s example. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I strongly support this report because after many years, we have finally been given the opportunity to discuss extensively and condemn the human right violations in Western Sahara. This report is really thorough in stressing the Sahrawiʼs right to self-determination and the need to organise a referendum. Unfortunately we lost an opportunity to highlight the importance of not re-instituting a fisheries agreement with Morocco while the controversy over the exploitation of Western Saharaʼs natural resources remains unresolved. In fact, to be consistent with our human right policies we should have voted for the amendment signed by almost 100 MEPs, asking the Commission to submit clear proposals on how such an agreement could be implemented in a manner acceptable to all parties concerned. Unfortunately, this time, and at the cost of only a few votes, human rights were overcome by economic interests. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I voted for this resolution because it acknowledges that an empowered civil society represents a crucial and integral component of any democracy. For this reason the EU should have a strong political commitment to promoting an enabling environment for civil society organisations at national level as well as at regional and international levels. In this resolution we welcome the recent policy developments focused on a more ambitious partnership with local authorities and civil society organisations, founded on a human rights-based approach which includes economic, social and cultural rights.

The persisting economic crisis and austerity measures in several Member States are putting the lives of EU citizens under heavy pressure due to unemployment, social exclusion and poverty. In particular, this austerity policy is having a direct adverse impact on young peoples’ prospects of gaining access to and remaining in education and employment. For this reason with this text we ask Member States to uphold the right of all persons, whatever their economic circumstances, to free and universal high-quality education. We call too on the Member States to make public expenditure and investment in education, training, and research and innovation a priority. Indeed, investing in these areas is essential for the economic recovery and global competitiveness of the Union and for progress to be made in achieving the Europe 2020 objectives. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

 Madam President, Commissioner Füle, I am a strong believer in the European Neighbourhood Policy. This policy is the future of the European project and should continue to be characterised by the European spirit at its best, by which I mean tolerance, dialogue and leading by example. We should never see this policy degraded into a patronising and neocolonising endeavour. We are not carrying out an exercise of hostility and competition with Russia. We are not playing a repetition of the Great Game of two centuries ago, because Russia is also part of Europe and is not a threat to us. Likewise, we should not be perceived as a threat to them. Our inspirers and fathers are not Mackinder and Dzerzhinsky, but Schuman and Spinelli. Pino Arlacchi  (S&amp;D

I support this resolution because it states that a lasting solution to the current crisis in Syria can only be achieved through a Syrian-led inclusive political process with the backing of the international community. For this reason it is fundamental to support the efforts of the European Union and of UN-Arab League Joint Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi to achieve progress in the Geneva II process and at the UN Security Council. With this text we also urge the EU and the Member States to live up to their humanitarian responsibilities and to increase their assistance to Syrian refugees. I personally strongly believe that any military intervention – with or without UN authorisation – in Syria is bound to have grave and highly unpredictable consequences and that a worsening of the situation on the ground cannot be excluded. Only a strategic, global approach articulating humanitarian and political dimensions can put an end to the violence and mass human rights violations and promote a democratic transition in Syria.

I support this text because after the military coup of July Egypt is in a very unstable and worrying situation. The political tensions continue to provoke violent clashes, which have resulted in more than 1 000 deaths and many more injured. I am firmly convinced that any exclusion or prosecution against a democratic political force or actor in Egypt can only lead to increased radicalism. We need to condemn in the stronger possible terms the disproportionate use of force against the protesters without penalising the Egyptian population while suspending aid to the country. In addition, with this resolution we urge the EU to proceed without delay to establish an EU mechanism providing legal and technical assistance to Arab Spring countries in the process of asset recovery. This instrument, already supported by this Parliament on several occasions, was delayed because of the turmoil in Egypt. It is vital to bear in mind that asset recovery has a highly symbolic value and may contribute largely to restoring accountability, creating stability and building solid institutions in the spirit of democracy and the rule of law in the partner countries concerned.

I abstained in voting on this resolution because although it makes a good analysis of the importance of global maritime flows for the European Union, it regrets cuts in national defence budgets.

I abstained in the vote on this report because I find the Nobel Prize to the European Union incongruous with the desire to expand the EU military sector.

I support this resolution because I believe that the Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius could become an important opportunity for the gradual improvement of EU-Belarus relations. For this reason with this text we urge the Belarusian authorities to respect human rights and work towards a democratic transition in order to end the country’s self-imposed isolation from the rest of Europe. I also think that the EU should carry out an in-depth evaluation of the EUʼs current restrictive measures against Belarusian officials and entities, which have so far proved to be ineffective in bringing democratic change in Belarus.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to have the fact that I was absent during the last part-session recorded in the minutes. The United Nations had invited me, in my capacity as Chair of the Special Committee on Organised Crime, Corruption and Money Laundering, to work on the UN report on transnational organised crime cases.

I would therefore ask for everything to be recorded in the minutes at the earliest opportunity. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself for the umpteenth time – this is the third year of my term of office – and time and again we deal with the same problems as if it were the first time. And this year, as in every other year, we are once again witnessing a mass slaughter. The Mediterranean has now become an open mass grave. It is also the tomb of civilisation and, above all, the tomb of the hopes of thousands of people fleeing – men, women and children as has just been mentioned – fleeing from their countries and fleeing, above all, from civil and religious persecution. Europe has major responsibilities because it has negotiated with murderers like Gaddafi, who have used these poor martyrs – and Gaddafi did so precisely to raise the stakes and at the very moment Europe was in negotiations with Libya. Every time, we find ourselves debating the issue as if it were the first time. What I want to know is what are we planning to do about it? What actual responses are we going to give our citizens? Yet again, this is another tragedy and, as Mr Moraes quite rightly has pointed out, the Italian Government may have changed, but we still have to give answers. Sonia Alfano,

Mr President, I would like to offer you my best wishes on your new position. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy that today, we are debating in plenary a resolution that stems from the many petitions that reach the European Parliament, and that refers specifically to the question of waste. These petitions demonstrate the concern of European citizens about the harm done to the environment, human health and the economy by waste management practices prevalent in various areas in Europe. Even though I agree with the overall structure of the resolution, I am rather dissatisfied with how some of its passages address the issue of incinerators. At times, it seems that thanks to technology, any problem related to public health and the environment has been completely overcome. Until last year, right here, we were hearing the same words about nuclear power plants. Today, however, in this same Chamber, it is difficult to find anyone willing to defend the nuclear industry. Is it possible that politics is simply unable to take a long-term view? Do we really have to wait for more epidemiological studies confirming the increased cancer rates already found throughout populations living near incinerators? This is not the NIMBY syndrome, but simply the citizens defending their right to health. There are alternatives that are virtuous and create employment. We must implement the spirit of the Waste Management Directive strictly, with a waste cycle based on the concepts of reduction, reuse and recycling. Landfill and incineration are residual, hierarchically inferior options, resorted to only after everything else possible has been done. If there was a political will to that effect, incinerators would be a nice memory. I think that Parliament should take a more advanced stance and better protect its citizens in this area. I hope that the European Commission will propose stricter criteria and procedures for building incinerators and opening landfill sites, and encourage serious ‘zero waste’ policies in all Member States.

 Madam President, I would like to ask Parliament to express its solidarity for the people of my region, Sicily, which in recent weeks has been hit by terrible floods.

This is mainly the fault of the bad habit of failing to manage the land properly. Sonia Alfano,

Madam President, I first of all wish to thank Mr Cashman for his excellent work and, in particular, for his great patience. As we all know, democracy is based on making legislative work public, on the transparency of the decision-making process, and on the people’s right to make informed decisions. For this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Treaties have proclaimed the fundamental right to access documents and information. This right must be guaranteed for all citizens, from local to international levels, in order to ensure that the institutions carry out the task for which they were created: to work on the citizens’ behalf in a transparent manner. Transparency is essential to prevent and combat corruption and the infiltration of the institutions at all levels by organised crime and powerful interests. I am particularly satisfied because the report on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding access to documents has accepted some important amendments which I submitted, in particular, those on financial and budgetary transparency, on the beneficiaries of European funds, on how EU money is spent, and on how European policies are implemented, all of which can be accessed via a database on the Internet. Other amendments submitted by me are included in the report, establishing rules for accessing information in electronic format contained in European databases, rules to limit exceptions to document access, especially when they refer to European legislative procedures, and rules for overriding the power of Member States to veto the publication of documents. The ALDE Group will therefore vote in favour of the Cashman report and I hope that the majority of this Parliament will support it, despite the opposition of some Members who have induced their groups to follow the interests of economic bureaucratic and industrial lobbies or those entrenched in the defence of the class and its secrets. The ALDE Group moreover asks the European Commission and Council to accept the proposals of the European Parliament and, under the Danish Presidency, to launch negotiations so as to finally take the necessary steps forward to assert the fundamental and democratic right of citizens to acquire the knowledge they require in order to make their decisions.

 Madam President, Commissioner, there are many facts that unfortunately lead us to the conclusion that human rights and freedom of expression are constantly being violated in Kazakhstan. I can give an actual example, to back up my statement. On 26 October 2011, cameraman Asan Amilov and journalist Orken Bizenov were the victims of an armed attack in the district of Mańğystau. Their newspaper Stan.kz
 first went into print in March 2007 with a network of correspondents throughout Central Asia, providing prompt and professional information about what was going on in Kazakhstan and its neighbouring countries, and winning a positive response from the people. It is surely no coincidence that the attackers took the journalists’ laptop, which contained important video footage from the strikes of the oil company workers in Mańğystau. This is just the latest of many examples of intimidation which all too often involve the public authorities. I call on the Commission to take a decisive stance in condemning such practices and to take their attempts to violate the freedom of the press into due consideration in the EU’s negotiations with these countries. Finally, I support the proposal to organise a round table at EU level between the Kazakhstan authorities, the workers’ representatives in the province of Mańğystau and the oil company representatives, in order to find a solution to the serious situation that emerged with the strikes of May 2011.

 Mr President, I would like to request a roll-call vote for the final vote on the report on organised crime. My thanks go to all the shadow rapporteurs: Mr Iacolino, Mr Crocetta, Mr Albrecht, Mr de Jong, Mr Kirkhope, Ms Borsellino and Ms Costa, since they all made a decisive contribution to the drafting of the final report. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, relatives of mafia victims, judges and witnesses are here in the gallery. If Parliament adopts this report today, we will be giving due recognition, and be able to dedicate this work, to all the innocent victims of organised crime and mafias. Their memory, the memory of those who paid with their lives for choosing not to give in to the foulness of moral compromise must guide us, and it compels us to send strong, unequivocal signals, such as the one I hope we are about to send to Europe’s citizens today. (Applause) Sonia Alfano,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with the work that has been achieved with the political groups, particularly the shadow rapporteurs: Mr Iacolino for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Mr Crocetta for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Mr Albrecht for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mr Kirkhope for the European Conservatives and Reformists and Mr de Jong for the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. Their noteworthy contributions were decisive in arriving at an advanced and ambitious final draft. Organised crime and mafias are one of the main threats to the security and freedoms of the people of Europe. For the first time in European political history, an official document is making explicit reference to mafias and to the need for specific, transnational measures to fight them. It is crucial to focus on organised crime and mafias because, as the Europol reports show, organised criminal groups are cropping up everywhere; they are taking root in the Member States and have heavily infiltrated the economy, finance, politics and all levels of government. With this report, Parliament is proposing a concrete political line of attack, a serious, coordinated intervention and a treatment that is at last a match for the seriousness of the situation. This treatment is based on the intelligence gathering and analyses of those who fight organised crime every day. I take this opportunity to thank the judges, police representatives, researchers and witnesses who have contributed their precious experience to drawing up the definitive solutions proposed here. In a spirit of service and self-denial, they represent their Member States on a daily basis in an unequal fight against criminal organisations. What drives criminal organisations is profit. That is why in the report, we have prioritised attacking assets that can be directly or indirectly traced back to organised crime. We are therefore looking forward with extreme interest to the proposal for a directive that the Commission is due to submit in the coming months on a European body of law to identify, freeze, seize and confiscate criminal assets. I am therefore very happy to see Commissioner Reding here, and I would like to put Parliament’s specific political wishes to her. We ask for European rules to allow so-called extended confiscation and effective preventive measures, such as non conviction-based confiscation; we ask for rules to allow the targeting of assets held by front persons; and, above all, we call for rules to use confiscated assets for social purposes, so as to turn it into a cultural operation with the full involvement of civil society, without which merely fighting organised crime would be a wasted effort. To give an idea of the importance of the document to be voted on tomorrow, I will give a list of the measures requested at European level: harmonisation of legislation on organised crime; rules for greater victim protection; extension of the offence of mafia association to all Member States; greater coordination and cooperation between Europol, Eurojust and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and with national authorities; improved judicial cooperation and full implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions; rules on transparency and prevention to stop public funds ending up in the hands of organised criminals; rules to counter financial crime and money laundering; and rules to prevent people convicted of offences connected with organised crime from standing in European elections. We are absolutely sure about one thing, Commissioner: these demands, which we vigorously called for in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and which we are about to adopt here, will not remain mere words. We will use every means at our disposal to put them into practice, in line with the Treaties in force which, fully in accordance with the democratic nature of the European Union, assign to the national parliaments and the European Parliament the fundamental role of guiding and assessing policy in the area of freedom, security and justice so as to protect the interests of the people of Europe. That is why we hope the Commission will immediately acknowledge the political importance and significance of this House’s position. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I would like to dedicate this work – this first step that Parliament is about to take – to all the innocent victims of organised crime and mafias. Their memory, the memory of those who paid with their lives for choosing not to give in to the foulness of moral compromise, must guide us, and it compels us to send out strong, unequivocal signals, such as the one I hope we will send to the people of Europe tomorrow.

 Mr President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, the first meeting of the EU-Tunisia task force, which is charged with support for the transition to democracy and economic recovery, took place today. This year, Europe’s financial commitment was doubled, and obviously I welcome this, because Tunisia, with which we have a privileged partnership, has also agreed to accept sub-Saharan refugees fleeing from the war in Libya. The European Union, which has often reaffirmed its commitment to the refugees, must without fail support and aid Tunisia to manage these migration flows while fully respecting human rights. Norway, although not part of the European Union, has agreed to accommodate more than 300 refugees, while EU Member States have agreed to accommodate fewer than 400 refugees in total. I consider this to be a deplorable and shameful attitude, a real insult to the principle of solidarity that should underpin the European Union’s Mediterranean policy. I should remind you, what is more, that these refugees are currently confined in camps in intolerable conditions. This morning in this very Chamber the European Parliament approved by a large majority an allocation of EUR 43.9 million for managing the migrant and refugee flows arising from repression by authoritarian regimes and movements linked to the Arab Spring. These additional funds will be used to assist the Member States most affected by these flows and to reinforce marine patrols by Frontex. Let us reaffirm our assent to a Europe committed as much to the promotion of human rights as to the management of migration flows, and let us reject the idea of a fortress Europe that is xenophobic and closed. Today, the European Union is paying the price of its previous support for the dictatorial regimes of North Africa. Our former friends Gaddafi and Ben Ali have fallen or are falling and their people are fleeing repression. I should like to know what stage the joint EU resettlement programme, currently blocked in the Council, has reached. I am asking you, Commissioner, whom I know to be extremely sensitive and pro-active, how, in the current situation, can the European Union make a concrete commitment with regard to this humanitarian emergency? In conclusion, I am taking the opportunity of asking the Commission whether it is aware of what is happening in Palermo, where the Italian authorities are forcing 250 migrants to remain aboard a ship, without any provision authorising their detention, and denying them their right to freedom and to communicate with the outside world. Thanks to numerous reports presented to the Public Prosecutor’s Office at Palermo by many organisations in Palermo and Sicily fighting for human rights, the Palermo Public Prosecutor has just opened an investigation. This event follows some extremely serious facts that took place at Lampedusa last week, where the situation is out of control and where the safety of both the local population and that of the migrants themselves is at risk.

 Mr President, I would like to say something about the botched attempt at evacuation that took place in Parliament in Brussels last week. I think what happened was totally against the rules, because nobody came round to our rooms to warn us and tell us that we had to leave and evacuate the building, and then outside Parliament we were all free to do whatever we liked. I would therefore like to know how much this Parliament spends every year on evacuation procedures and Parliament’s safety. I would expect an institution of this kind to have somewhat stricter rules, at the very least. Sonia Alfano,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have studied the anti-corruption package presented by the Commission in June extremely carefully, and I have to say that I am impressed with the content of the package. It is a good starting point, and all the European institutions, especially the European Parliament, must strive to achieve real, measurable results quickly. Today corruption is the main route by which organised crime penetrates the legal economy and the public sector. Corruption creates criminal systems, and dangerous connections between entrepreneurs, politicians and public officials. It is estimated that the cost of corruption in Europe is some EUR 120 billion. I have to say that this is a conservative estimate given that in my country, Italy, alone, corruption accounts for EUR 60 billion a year, practically the amount of a financial package that at the moment would save my country from default. With regard to the June communication and the proposals presented, I would like to ask the Commission what measures it intends to propose to improve the fight against corruption in the private sector. Can it give us some details about how it intends to improve financial investigations? What measures does it intend to propose to combat political corruption, and what point have the assessments of the review of the tender directive to combat conflicts of interest and of the draft directive for regulating concessions reached? As Mr Albrecht has already said, this Parliament and these institutions have already been working on equally important problems, such as terrorism, for some time. This directive, the directive on corruption, gives ample space and visibility, and above all it gives us the chance to consider and to understand once and for all the extent to which organised crime is firmly entrenched in all 27 Member States. In any case, Commissioner, this is what you said exactly one year ago, and these answers are crucial for us, especially considering the fact that in a month’s time we will be voting on the report on organised crime in Europe, for which I am the rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment of the Frontex Regulation, on which we are voting today, is designed to strengthen the European Agency, endowing it with greater operational capabilities and strengthening the enforcement of the fundamental rights of refugees and asylum seekers but, above all, the ban on refoulement. The creation of a fundamental rights officer role within the Frontex Management Board and the requirement for Member States to show solidarity with each other are steps in that direction. The reform of Frontex must enable us to tackle the real migration-related emergencies in Europe. Only today, the Financial Times
 reports that approximately 85% of the 104 000 migrants who entered the EU illegally in 2010 arrived via Greece, and not via Italy or Malta, and unfortunately the same will be true in 2012. Only if Frontex fully respects migrants’ human rights and helps to prevent the huge number of deaths in the Mediterranean, which has now become a burial ground in which the lives and hopes of people fleeing poverty, oppression and desperation are extinguished, will we be able to say that we are on the right track. This must be Frontex’s goal, and the European Parliament will have to monitor the progress made in this regard. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Ms Hautala and Ms Sargentini on their excellent work. Through the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, transparency has become a basic right of European citizens. We are on the right track, but unfortunately, even in this day and age, there is great resistance when we talk about transparency. In my opinion, there is no middle way: anyone against full transparency obviously has something to hide and would prefer for decisions to be taken out of sight from citizens and the press. The Commission refuses to accept the proposals to revise the regulation on access to documents, which were put forward by Parliament in the report by Mr Cashman and provide for greater transparency. The Council, meanwhile, systematically refuses to make the identities of Member States known during discussions and votes in their meetings. The legal services of the Commission, the Council and Parliament continue to use excuses to hide their legal opinions, despite the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the Turco
 case. Even in Parliament, there is substantial resistance to guaranteeing access to information for citizens, particularly with regard to the activities of Members and the expenditure of this House and its Members. The so-called Galvin report has finally been published, though unfortunately, the names are missing from it. I believe that transparency is one of democracy’s basic tools for combating abuses of power, waste and corruption, and for forging closer relationships between citizens and institutions. In my view, the report by Ms Hautala and Ms Sargentini works along these same lines and hence it deserves the maximum support. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I shall be voting in favour of this report. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday 60 000 Italians demonstrated in Val di Susa against the absurd project to build the Lyon-Turin high-speed rail link (‘TAV’). As an MEP I condemn all forms of violence, whether the violence of the rioters who created disorder yesterday or the violence of the Italian members of parliament and ministers who today tried to liken the peaceful ‘No TAV’ people to the ‘Black Bloc’. Everyone knows that the high-speed rail link in Val di Susa will never be built. Can an area be militarised for 20 years? This is the result of failing to listen to the people and should be a lesson to the EU. Works are done with the citizens for the citizens, not for party political committees on the left and right. The deadlines imposed by the Commission for the provision of the European contribution, amounting to EUR 662 million, have expired. Mr Kallas should decide to withdraw the funding immediately. With these extensions, Italy is enjoying privileges not granted to other Member States. Therefore, I urge the Committee on Petitions to send a delegation to Val di Susa as soon as possible to establish what is happening and listen to local people. The European Parliament should not abandon these citizens and their arguments. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, Commissioner, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is the first instrument implemented in the European Union that puts into practice the principle of mutual recognition of criminal judgments. That instrument is fundamentally important now and should remain so, especially for fighting mafia groups and organised crime. In the report on organised crime, for which I am the rapporteur in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we are proposing a series of considerations and requests concerning the European Arrest Warrant. One of the main requests is for the EAW to be strengthened and better enforced by the Member States, bearing in mind the requirements and the specific nature of the fight against organised crime. I therefore ask the Commission how it intends to proceed and whether it intends to submit a proposal to remove the Member States’ discretion in the transposition of Articles 3 and 4 of the framework decision, concerning the grounds for mandatory non-execution and optional non-execution. With regard to the grounds for optional non-execution, I also ask whether it may not be appropriate to restrict them in the case of offences typically attributable to organised crime, including the offence of association with a mafia organisation, for which double criminality should not apply anyway.

Now I have raised the matter, I will send all MEPs today a video that was filmed in L’Aquila on 13 January.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the emergency situation is teaching the European policy on asylum and immigration a serious lesson It is again evident that the EU does not have a legislative and operational framework that enables it to cope with extraordinary but not unforeseeable events, such as the events of recent months in North Africa. Lampedusa, Italy and Southern Italy are paying for these mistakes, but the main ones to pay are the refugees who are received in such an inhumane manner. Despite Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and the principle of equitable sharing of solidarity, all the countries are actually concerned only with their own affairs and the attitude of France, which shares a border with Italy, is unacceptable in the current European scenario. In this regard, I urge the Commission to consider the possibility of seeking an explanation from the French Government. For years, the EU has entered into agreements with third countries run by dictatorships, funding their activities and putting business interests before democratic requirements. Europe has remained silent before the Libyan raids: does it also intend to remain silent in the face of the unsustainable situation of the tent camps? Of course, we all agree that we cannot make deals with Colonel Gaddafi, yet, a few months ago, I did not hear any objections to the Italy-Libya treaty, which has led to the immigration issue being addressed in the most inhuman way. Today, President Berlusconi tried to use the same approach with Tunisia, offering money. Perhaps, though, the new Tunisian Government has learned its lesson. Yet, like it or not, it is the responsibility of the EU and the 27 Member States to take action, bearing in mind the overriding priority of international solidarity and the protection of human rights. For this reason, I hope that the European Commission proposes the introduction of the emergency procedure laid down in Directive 2001/55/EC on temporary protection as soon as possible, and that this proposal is adopted by the Council in the near future, because otherwise it will be in vain. I also call for a parliamentary delegation, not a delegation of political groups, to be sent to Lampedusa to verify both the humanitarian conditions of the immigrants and the non-refoulement
 principle. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to speak before you highlighted Parliament’s determination to call for the resignation of the other MEP, the last MEP, who has not yet resigned. I thank you and thank Parliament for making a firm and determined decision to implement a zero-tolerance policy because this is all about the credibility of everyone in this House, and above all we must remember that we represent 500 million citizens and not the lobbies, thank you.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as some have said, Baroness Ashton, you have shown great courage by taking the bull by the horns in this case, but I think there are a number of basic steps to be taken. Meanwhile, you have spoken about bringing the guilty parties to justice. Let us call them by their real name: we need to bring Mr Gaddafi to justice. You also spoke about violence. Instead, I think it is right to say that genocide is taking over in these territories, yet again. We cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand. I think the first thing we need to do is to recognise the Libyan National Council, a transitional council. We must have an interlocutor; we cannot carry on speaking only of sharply reduced humanitarian aid. There is no doubt that we must all speak up for a no-fly zone. We cannot continue accepting the vetoes of China and Russia, countries that are run by dictators. China censors the Internet while Russia kills journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya. I think that right now, the first thing to do is to begin setting out our stall and recognise the Libyan National Council. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that events in the Middle East have made it clear to the European institutions that they cannot continue to ignore the violation of fundamental rights and of national constitutions. Please forgive me but I must again report a shameful action by the ruling majority in Italy, which would like to save Mr Berlusconi from the trials that have just begun over serious crimes such as extortion and exploitation of child prostitution. The Italian majority, in fact, called on the Constitutional Court to decide which court should try Mr Berlusconi. Certainly, the Constitutional Court will throw out the request of a judge on a personal basis, but we must not continue to ignore Mr Berlusconi’s umpteenth attack on Italian democracy and the independence of the Italian judiciary. Many colleagues have already signed a petition to send out a strong signal that will reach the Italian people from their own MEPs. It is a curious coincidence, Mr President, that while Mr Berlusconi has been attacking the judiciary for years, the Minister for Justice, Mr Alfano, has ingenuously come to Strasbourg to describe the plan for making justice efficient and cannot find a single moment to meet the European Parliament. Perhaps he is afraid to face uncomfortable questions from the representatives of the people concerning the Italian justice system and the way people are trying to destroy its independence?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so immediately willing and far-sighted in offering Italy assistance, although the assistance was rejected in the first instance by the Italian Government itself. Commissioner, you have rightly stressed the need to support Tunisia at this time of democratic transition. However, I wonder, and I ask you all: what has happened to the money that Europe has been pouring into Tunisia all these years and which it is still pouring into Libya, which – as we know – are democratic regimes? Therefore, it is now wonderful and amazing to cheer this awakening of the Tunisian people, although I wonder how on earth all that money was ever granted. If the Libyans woke up tomorrow, what conclusion would we draw from that? Would we have thought yet again that we had been funding democratic regimes, only to realise the next day that we had been implementing a disastrous policy instead? I ask myself, Commissioner, how on earth Europe has kept quiet about this democratic awakening, while only the United States has offered strong guidance in this respect. I would like to pick up on what Mr Portas and Mr Tavares said. They pointed out, extraordinarily, that in countries like Tunisia, emigration is viewed as a crime. To begin with, regarding all the people who have landed on Lampedusa – and I would remind Mr Madlener that they are not Libyans but Tunisians, although that is hardly important because Libyans will soon be arriving as well – who will decide whether they are refugees or not, given that a situation of extreme confusion reigns in Tunisia at the moment? Above all, however, how will we feel if we repatriate these people, in the knowledge that they will be thrown into prison as soon as they arrive? These, then, are the points that I believe we should be thinking about, and, above all, we should realise that racist policies like those implemented by the Italian Government have unfortunately produced only highly negative results.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is barely credible for the European institutions to still want to conclude a framework agreement with a dictatorship like Libya. We cannot go on saying that Libya has very important trading relations with European Union Member States and acts as a partner for the European Union in the Mediterranean basin, and putting respect for human rights as a secondary issue. The primary condition for us to be able to start a credible dialogue with Libya is for that country to ratify the Geneva Convention. We cannot barter economic interests for human lives: not just the lives of Libyan citizens, but also of people from other countries who are fleeing civil wars and religious persecution and pass through Libya only to find death and horrendous torture. We have a duty not to forget the thousands of calls for help made by people held in Libyan prisons. We cannot forget the horrors that Gandufa prison revealed to us. Libyan citizens do not enjoy many political and civil rights, such as freedom of expression, assembly and association. The oral amendment by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which seeks to replace the term ‘treaty’ in recital B with ‘agreements between Italy and Libya on joint coastal patrols’ is absolutely unacceptable, and the Italian delegation from Italia dei Valori
 will vote against it. The agreement between Italy and Libya is much more complex: it is a treaty with precise conditions regarding more complex issues than joint coastal patrols. For the European Parliament to remain credible, it needs to call a spade a spade, even if that may be embarrassing. A separate discourse needs to be entered into for the UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency, which is unable to carry out its work in Libya and is accused by the Libyan regime of incredible abuses and crimes. Are these the bases on which agreements should be conducted? We cannot deal with either terrorists or dictators. We are the European Parliament, not the board of directors of an economic giant.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, Directive 2001/77/EC lays down the definition of renewable energy sources with the aim of identifying those for which public incentives may be provided. Renewable energy sources exclude the incineration of the non-biodegradable part of waste. Since 1992, Italy has provided incentives by increasing its citizens’ energy bills and building incinerators, which are scientifically proven to be bad for people’s health and the environment and which the European Union has thus classified as a residual integrated waste management option. Two infringement procedures have been launched with regard to these incentives and, despite formal legislative intervention, in Italy, waste incineration is still being encouraged as a source of renewable energy, with the Acerra case being just one example of this. I realise that it may be difficult for you to remember the details of the situation concerning the CIP 6, which is why I have submitted a written question. However, I would ask you to confirm that incentives may not be provided for the incineration of non-biodegradable waste as a source of renewable energy and that there are no derogations in place for this. I would also like to know whether it is not considered inconsistent for the Waste Directive to establish incineration as a residual waste disposal option, while Directive 2001/77/EC encourages it as a form of renewable energy. Does the Commission intend to review this matter? Sonia Alfano,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the Italian Government’s propaganda, which was soon disproved by the Commission, the waste crisis in Campania is a structural problem that is anything but resolved. Questionable lists aside, we need to realise one thing: the people of Campania continue to live – and die – surrounded by waste. The local, regional and national politicians, on the right and on the left, have an enormous responsibility. The task of solving the problem cannot be offloaded on to the citizens, who are already suffering from completely unhealthy living conditions. The European Union must insist that a worthy solution is found, or else its intervention will have been in vain. The construction of incinerators, which, by the way, are financed as renewable energy sources and thereby infringe current European legislation, will not solve the issue. The waste would be turned into ash, causing harmful and deadly emissions. Pursuant to the Waste Directive, incinerators shall be the last option in a hierarchy of integrated waste systems that presents virtuous alternatives that have no public health or environmental impact but instead create employment. As far as Mafia infiltration is concerned, I feel it should be acknowledged that, while Mafia infiltration, particularly in the field of waste, does happen in the south, it happens primarily in the north. This has been especially true over the last few years. I therefore have three questions for the Commission: what action does it intend to take to ensure that the solution to the problem does not affect people’s health, and how does it intend to prevent decisions from being imposed on the public and areas from actually becoming militarised? Does it think that the immediate launch of a cancer registry for the entire region should be one of the conditions for closing the infringement procedure? What is the Commission’s assessment of Law No 210 of 2008 and, in particular, of Article 9 on incentives for the construction of incinerators, in which European legislation on State aid is clearly infringed?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a number of years, many families in Italy and just as many Romanian children have been suffering the consequences of Romania’s block on international adoptions. The Hague Convention is the benchmark framework to be implemented uniformly in all countries of the European Union, and Romania needs to make an effort to adjust to it. If Romania believes that the block on international adoptions works to protect children – for example, from the risk that a market for the illegal trafficking of children would be created – it must also deal with this problem with the help of the European Union, by toughening up controls and introducing strict regulations. However, we need to make an effort to ensure that many respectable families can adopt children, who deserve a second chance for a happy childhood. I would therefore ask the Commission how it intends to support a possible commitment from Romania to remove the moratorium on international adoptions and, furthermore, I should like to know the Commission’s position on the possibility of creating a European adoption agency, including in the light of the studies carried out.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 and 14 January, a referendum was held at the Fiat plant at Mirafiori in which both blue- and white-collar workers were asked to vote for or against the recovery plan for the plant in Turin. The plan is based on a new collective agreement that undermines workers’ fundamental rights relating to illness and strike action, and even the midday break during eight hours’ work on an assembly line. The referendum is illegitimate because the chief executive officer, Mr Marchionne, has threatened workers that if the agreement is rejected, the business is likely to abandon manufacturing in Italy and move elsewhere. This strategy of fear, of unbridled capitalism without consideration for rules or rights, was supported by the government and even by much of the Democratic Party, an opposition party that has its roots in the Italian Communist Party. The only unions to oppose the agreement were the Italian Federation of Metalworkers (FIOM) and the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL), and they were ousted from the union representation. In any case, the referendum passed with just 54% of the votes. As a result of this agreement, workers’ rights in Italy have slipped back several decades. Europe should know this and bear it in mind.

 I think it was a good idea for the Commission to attend Parliament today to report on the ban on the use of unenriched cages for laying hens, which will enter into force from January 2012. The implementation data are not very encouraging and, hence, very tough action is required against Member States that, out of indolence, have not made any progress for a while. The prohibition of these cages has been known since 1999, and those Member States that joined later were perfectly aware of having to take action on this issue according to precise timescales. Delay is unacceptable. Deadlines must be respected to make the European Union’s actions credible. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union requires the EU to enforce its policies, bearing in mind the welfare of animals as sentient beings. We must not always hide behind the problem of competitiveness, which should not be considered as an issue of quantity and prices but, above all, of quality, environmental sustainability and ethics, too. The critical and aware consumer must be at the heart of a new economic model that the EU should spearhead. I therefore hope that the Commission will proceed swiftly and determinedly to implement Council Directive 1999/74/EC, to protect both animals and consumers. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been following the legislative procedure for the European citizens’ initiative very closely and I am happy – partly on the basis of the statements by the Council and the Commission – that the first petitions will be launched a year from now. I am also proud to be able to announce to the European Parliament that in Italy a broad grassroots movement of citizens, associations and committees has sprung up in the wake of the approval of the outrageous directive on animal research. This movement will not sit on its hands this year, but will work to prepare a proposal for the Commission: a proposal to give the European Union modern and civilised laws and that says ‘no’ to animal testing – a cruel and scientifically ineffective practice – while strongly encouraging alternative methods. Saying ‘no’ to vivisection must be an objective of the European Union, since it is a desire of its citizens. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is well known that the activities of the Italian Government represent a constant violation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We only need to think of the agreement between Italy and Libya, which succeeded in infringing dozens of articles of the Charter, or the proposed ‘bavaglio
’ law that set out to gag the press and the legal system. We are talking about a government supported by a parliament elected in an undemocratic manner, without allowing citizens the chance to express a preference, a government that yesterday won a vote of confidence with votes from the opposition benches from Members of Parliament who publicly admitted that they had been approached with promises of standing at future elections and cash for votes.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union cannot back down from the energy challenge that will decide the fate of the planet. We must dispel the myth that the economic development of a country is closely tied to an increase in energy consumption. Europe must pioneer a new sustainable economic model, based on lower use of resources, including energy, with greater productivity. We must therefore break the link between economic growth and an increase in energy sold to industries and the public and instead link it to an increase in energy services that create employment and energy efficiency. For these reasons, I believe that energy efficiency represents a priority for the future of the EU, in both economic and environmental terms, and I hope that the Commission will immediately take the necessary measures to implement the binding objectives that Parliament established today.

 Mr President, notwithstanding the European Convention on Human Rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union and the national constitutions, serious violations of human rights persist on a daily basis in the European Union and in the Member States. In my country – Italy – there is a regime in force in which freedom of the press is violated, political parties take part in elections by submitting fake signatures, State secrecy covers up violent attacks (including by the Mafia), our Prime Minister – though not for much longer, we hope – profits from international cooperation with regimes like those in Russia and Libya, as was also confirmed by WikiLeaks. The European Union cannot allow itself to turn a blind eye to all of this. For these reasons, I support the report, which contains many of the amendments submitted by me and approved in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Amongst these, I should like to single out paragraphs 20 and 40, which call for human rights violations to be monitored and penalised, and for national legislative proposals with the potential to violate human rights to be frozen before they become law, until the EU approves them. I also supported the incentive to use Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union to address human rights violations and to bolster the mandate of the Agency for Fundamental Rights. The report makes numerous positive references to minorities, rights, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, immigrants and asylum seekers, freedom of the press and social rights. For these reasons, I would urge my fellow Members to vote in favour of the report. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciate the work carried out by the two rapporteurs. However, the problem with this draft directive is that it is based on the most usual kind of stalking, in which a person has been a victim of violence by another and therefore must be defended against a repeat of whatever physical or mental abuse took place. Obviously, this is a matter of fundamental importance for hundreds of thousands of women in the European Union and therefore I fully support its content. Unfortunately, however, these measures do not take into account the victims of organised crime who, in the majority of cases, do not need to be defended from an identified or identifiable person, but from organisations against which a restraining order certainly cannot be applied. Therefore, I think that the European Parliament should regard this directive as a first step in implementing the Stockholm Programme, which talks expressly about measures to protect the victims of criminal activity, and it seems to me that Mrs Jiménez and Commissioner Reding are of the same mind. I appeal to the European Commission to ensure that the package of measures to protect victims, which is planned for 2011, also protects victims of organised crime and victims injured in the course of duty on a European level.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that, in the final version of the report, involvement in criminal organisations for offences relating to the trafficking of human beings is an aggravating factor that doubles the minimum penalties from five to ten years in prison. In addition, Article 6a makes explicit reference to the seizure and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds from this kind of offence. This approach – which I believe is absolutely right and I hope may also be carried over to other legislation – looks the facts in the face and recognises that the trafficking of people for various forms of exploitation, such as, for example, prostitution, criminal activities and organ trafficking, is carried out by international criminal organisations. I am also pleased with the provisions of Article 7, which directs Member States not to prosecute people for their involvement in criminal activities that they have been compelled to commit as victims of trafficking. Often, in fact, those who suffer the violence of trafficking not only suffer injuries, but also the insult of being incriminated for doing what they were compelled to do, prostitution being a typical example. Therefore, I support the report and I should like to thank the two rapporteurs. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 There is nothing more inhuman than exploiting the lives of other living beings for profit, infringing every fundamental right. Trafficking in human beings is one of the basest activities in history; it is a widespread and highly complex phenomenon. I am pleased that Parliament has approved at first reading the proposal for a directive on trafficking in human beings. This is a significant step forward in combating the phenomenon, which is the main activity of a large number of international criminal organisations. The most important point is the recognition that organised crime is the main problem to tackle. The EU is finally making a real, explicit distinction between crime and organised crime, because the latter is a truly separate issue. There are many other positive elements such as a broader definition of exploitation, greater protection for victims and the rule stipulating that victims of trafficking shall not be charged for crimes they have been forced to commit as a result of violence or the threat of violence against them. As Amnesty International points out, often women who are victims of trafficking are arrested for prostitution, or are not guaranteed full access to justice. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 As the statements by the government representatives of numerous States demonstrate, the extraordinary zeal with which Julian Assange is being investigated is clearly designed to punish him and WikiLeaks for having revealed certain top secrets to the world, such as the concerns of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who asked the US embassies in Rome and Moscow for information on any personal investments of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Putin that might influence the foreign or economic policies of their respective countries. Mr Berlusconi is described as Mr Putin’s spokesman in Europe. Clearly, what is taking place here is the unprecedented punishment and persecution of a man and an organisation whose only crime is to have made the world aware of certain grey areas that put governments in an uncomfortable position. Hence, it is our duty to protect the freedom of WikiLeaks and to guarantee fair treatment for Julian Assange, who should pay for his crimes, if proven, in a fair trial. I therefore call on the Commission to state its position on the WikiLeaks affair and to explain how it intends to monitor the situation so that this affair is not used to clamp down on freedom of information and to impose restrictions on the Internet, which has once again proved to be an exceptionally powerful democratic instrument, and which must therefore be protected.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the energy efficiency policies implemented so far by the various Member States for 2020 will not enable us to achieve the target of a 20% reduction in energy consumption; we will be lucky to manage 10%, which is a decidedly disappointing result. If energy consumption continues to increase, achieving the 20% renewable energy target may also be in jeopardy, since that target is calculated as a proportion of the EU’s final energy consumption. I am firmly in favour of setting a binding target for energy efficiency also, so as to ensure that Europe’s climate and energy policies are mutually reinforcing. Unfortunately, the facts suggest that counting on the goodwill of individual Member States is not going to work. The European Union must show the way with clear and effective policies and objectives. Let us stop investing in new facilities to produce more energy, and let us plough our money and our efforts into the cleanest energy in the world, energy that we can avoid using. Lastly, I call for the adoption of Amendment 2, which calls on the Commission to launch an initiative on the energy performance of existing buildings in 2011. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 18 December 1990, the UN adopted the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. This Convention is one of the UN’s nine main instruments on human rights. Unfortunately, 20 years later, none of the Member States of the European Union have signed or ratified that Convention. I believe that recognising the rights of third-country nationals who live and work legally in the European Union must be a priority for a Europe which faces new challenges in relation to integration, non-discrimination and protection of human rights. For this reason, I ask all Members to support Amendment 16 and to sign Written Declaration 96 – to which I am a signatory, together with Cornelia Ernst, Sylvie Guillaume and Franziska Keller – in order to petition Member States to ratify the UN Convention on migrant workers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the Belet report because it recognises and specifies the fundamental role played by public sector broadcasting in Europe. I see this as an important step for Parliament, which is clearly stating that public broadcasting needs to remain independent of political power. This report seems to have been written specially for Italy, where the RAI is now at an advanced stage of decomposition because it has been taken over completely by party politics, to the detriment of the cultural and informational depth of public broadcasting and, hence, of the entire country. Just look at what happened last week on the programme called ‘Vieni via con me’ (‘Come away with me’). The Minzolinis and Masis of broadcasting, professionals of public disinformation and their paymasters, are incompatible with the report that Parliament has adopted today. The European Union should take note and act accordingly. We want no more party politics on the RAI! Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of information about prescription-only medicinal products is a sensitive subject because it has an important effect on the protection of the right to health and welfare of all citizens. The European Commission sent us a proposal on the revision of the directive that risked opening a loophole in the legislation, which would have allowed pharmaceutical companies to exploit an unclear distinction between the definitions of information and advertising to promote their prescription-only medicinal products, to the detriment of the people. Of course, there is still much to do with regard to a suitable strategy for information on medicinal products, but fortunately this time the European Parliament has reacted as it always should. Parliament has taken a stand to protect citizens and defend a patient’s right to better information, and it has not given in to pressure from pharmaceutical companies. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Evans on the recast of the directive because I really regret the fact that in the compromise text, which was adopted due to strong pressure from industrial lobbies, all references to PVC and halogenated fire retardants have disappeared, even though all the studies carried out by the Commission have demonstrated since as far back as 2000 that the disposal of these substances poses serious risks for human health and the environment. Transferring the costs of industry to the environment and to citizens is an approach that we absolutely cannot support because, in addition to distorting the free market, it represents an unacceptable trade-off between peoples’ quality of life and the profits of business. I hope the next time the directive is updated, in three years’ time, that citizens' right to health and environmental protection will be placed right at the forefront. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have read the report carefully and I endorse it overall. However, I was left rather puzzled by various references to the future of coal in the European strategy, in particular in paragraph 52, in which the Commission is asked to draw up legal provisions to facilitate the building of coal-fired electric power plants. Several years ago in the United States, a political and citizens’ movement was started which has de facto 
led to a sort of moratorium on the building of coal-fired power plants. As well as CO2
 emissions, this decision is also based on the problem of dealing with the ash, which contains many toxic substances. Therefore, I absolutely do not support the defence of coal-fired power plants and I would note that so called ‘clean coal is, in many cases, more of a slogan than a reality. I have also heard several fellow Members fiercely defend nuclear energy, in terms of both costs and safety. Unfortunately, whoever says this shows that they do not know what they are talking about. Alternatives exist, they are renewable, they are genuine, and the European Union must plot its path for the coming decade in that direction. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciate the presence of Commissioner Hedegaard and the stance she has taken. I should like to thank you for your commitment to keeping Parliament continually updated on the developments for Cancún. The fight against climate change must be conducted on a global level and with everyone’s involvement, but the idea that our position must depend on that of other countries is irresponsible and does not do justice to the role that the EU has set itself, namely a leading role in guiding cultural revolutions at a global level, primarily the fight against climate change. We must set ourselves ever more ambitious targets and ensure that they are reached by the various Member States. I therefore thank the Commissioner for having reminded Italy, a few days ago, to maintain its financial promises of EUR 200 million to combat climate change. Unfortunately, I must inform the Commission that the Italian Government’s budget does not seem to provide for these funds at the moment. I would therefore ask the Commission to use all the powers available to it to make the Member States keep their promises, particularly when it is a matter of such a significant battle for the near future of the people of the world ...

 Madam President, the disaster of April 2010 is one of the most serious environmental disasters ever to have happened in the world. If the same thing happened within a closed sea such as the Mediterranean, the lives of tens of millions of European and non-European citizens would be threatened, with no way back. Yet in Italy – as Lega Ambiente
 protested with regard to an ill-conceived energy policy – we are seeing an extraordinary increase in research applications and permits granted by the ministry for identifying and extracting oil resources that would be sufficient to cover the Italian energy requirement for little more than one year. It is obvious that the sacrifice is not worth it. All this is compounded by concern over the fact that BP has announced an agreement with Libya for offshore extraction just under 500 km south of Sicily. I hope that the Commission undertakes, through this now imminent measure, to defend life in the Mediterranean against the attacks of multinationals and governments who are complicit and care little about our collective welfare.

 Madam President, I would like to report to Parliament that last Sunday, during the Pope’s visit to Palermo, the Italian Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union were suspended. Freedom of expression and of thought and the inviolability of private homes were trampled over. On this occasion, the Italian police insisted on the removal of a banner bearing a phrase from the Gospel: ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves’, while the same police force put up posters that were homophobic and against common-law couples. Inside the bookshop Altro quando
, the owner had put up a banner bearing the phrase ‘I love Milingo’. The police entered the private premises and seized the banner without any court warrant and using methods that were unedifying even by their own standards. It is paradoxical that in a lay and democratic State, as Italy is supposed to be, public freedom of expression is suppressed by the authorities in order not to offend the papal sensibilities, while Prime Minister Berlusconi is able to swear in public without this representing a problem for the Church. On this occasion, all the lay and religious institutions yet again rode roughshod over democracy in Italy, increasing the unbridgeable gap that has now emerged between institutions and the public. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Saturday, the Italian newspaper Il fatto quotidiano
 published a document signed by the Mafioso former mayor of Palermo, Vito Ciancimino, in which he wrote that Marcello Dell’Utri and Silvio Berlusconi were cut from the same cloth as him; that they belonged to the same mafia-dominated political system. This news comes to the attention of the magistracy as the truth emerges about the mafia massacres of 1992, which saw the deaths of judges Falcone and Borsellino, namely, the State negotiated with the mafia for the end of the ‘season of bombs’ and this favoured, as appears to be the case, the establishment of the Prime Minister’s party, Forza Italia
, which was indeed founded with the help of Dell’Utri, sentenced to seven years for mafia association and still a senator in the Italian Parliament. In the light of this and in the light of the recent murder of Mayor Angelo Vassallo by the Camorra, I reiterate the importance of the request made by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which, as a result of my continual pressure, has once again asked the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for a report on organised crime at European Union level. Europe cannot continue to turn the other cheek for fear of tackling a problem which is no longer local but globalised, and which right now closely affects the government of a Member State.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, under Rule 175 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, I call for this document to be referred back to committee. We have been waiting for this directive for a great many years but, as has been stressed in several other speeches, there are some items that need to be thoroughly amended in order to ensure adequate protection for animals. Adoption of this legislation will allow for experimentation for teaching purposes and the reuse of the same animal several times, even in procedures that cause it to suffer. It will not in any way encourage alternative methods that are considered scientifically valid. This is not a matter of adopting an extreme position, but rather of respecting Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which requires us to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals since they are sentient beings. We do not want to hold back research, but rather to encourage it along an ethically sustainable course. It is unacceptable to say that we can adopt this directive now and amend it in the years to come. We should take responsibility for making the necessary corrections to it now. This is not a political or ideological position; it is common sense, and common sense has no political hue. Sonia Alfano,  
on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all unfortunately aware of the information situation in Italy. We are classified as a partly free country by Freedom House and occupy 71st place along with the islands of Tonga, ranking only just above East Timor. The ‘gagging law’ is only the latest development in an overall situation in which the country’s democratic defences are being greatly weakened, in particular, due to the lack of free information. As the OECD indicates in its most recent report, the disintegration of democracy and of the vested rights to information and free expression is unfortunately spreading throughout Europe. We need only think of France, with its government-appointed top public television service executive, or Hungary, Estonia and Romania, which, after taking tough legal action to limit freedom of expression, are making it impossible for information to play its essential democratic role as government watchdog. For this reason, I believe it is the Commission’s duty to make a strong, consistent commitment to defending media and information freedom, in line with the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. I therefore ask the Commission what action it intends to take to promote genuine media pluralism in the EU Member States and, in particular, when it will issue the communication on indicators for media pluralism, which was promised for 2010, together with the associated legislative proposal. I would not like to think that, as with the expulsion of the Roma in France, the Commission is tempted to give up its defence of freedom and democracy in Europe in order to cover up the work of Member State governments, which are increasingly concerned with hiding their wrongdoings from the press and the public. I hope that you, and also Commissioner Reding, will be able to reassure me on this point. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with you, Mr President, that it is the European Union’s duty to play a fundamental role in international issues and that we must speak with one, strong voice. It is most certainly our responsibility to intervene promptly and decisively each time human rights are oppressed, no matter where in the world that happens. I hope that the next six months of the Belgian Presidency will be distinguished by an unwavering commitment on those issues. To demonstrate that commitment, I ask for immediate attention to be paid to what is happening in certain Libyan prisons in the Sahara Desert: 250 Eritrean citizens, including women and children, have been shut up for days in inhumane conditions, in violation of all international regulations on human rights and asylum. Many of these citizens were denied political refugee status, even though they met all the necessary requirements. The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Frattini, actually accused the European Union of not even having published a press release. I think now is the time for the European Union to speak with one, strong voice. Right now, we must not turn our heads and look the other way, because 250 people are asking us to save them from death.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to bring to the attention of the European Union the fate of 250 Eritreans who are now sending appeals for help by text message, as they are being detained in the Sahara Desert by the Libyan authorities. They are dying, they need help, and I would ask the European Union to attend to this issue. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the right to petition is one of the main instruments available to European citizens for active participation in the political activities of the European Union. In approaching my mandate as an MEP in the spirit of service and respect for the citizen, and the priority that this must have in the decisions of the European Parliament, I have often taken an interest in the petitions submitted ... (The President asked the speaker to speak more slowly)
 I have often taken an interest in the petitions submitted and in their progress in the relevant committee. Unfortunately, despite the fact that Parliament’s Rules of Procedure stipulated, in Rule 5(3), that Members shall be entitled to inspect any files held by Parliament or a committee, I have discovered that the internal e-Petition 
database is only accessible to members of the relevant committee. I contacted the committee in question but, unfortunately, did not receive a response. I think that this discrimination, which reduces the importance of citizen’s petitions and undermines the work of the parliamentary committee, ought to be redressed immediately. We have little time, Mr President, so we try to say everything in one minute. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is undoubtedly a good piece of work and I should like to compliment the rapporteur on it. One of the first phrases of the explanatory statement struck a very positive chord with me, and I would like to quote it directly: ‘waste management policy must transform the EU into a recycling society’. However, I do detect some contradictions there. For example, the fact that separate collection is mandatory as long as it is the best option from both the environmental and economic standpoints. In other words, investments made by Member States in this area are not to be subject to discussion even if they are contrary to European guidelines. In this way, as has already been seen with the framework directive on waste, the European Union will provide little more than a suggestion. Plus, we forget – by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, which the European institutions all too often hide behind – that it is our duty to provide ambitious and incisive responses to the problem of waste. Let us fix targets for separate collection and stipulate their fulfilment. Let us use best practices, like the ‘zero waste’ policies enacted in some parts of the USA and make them binding for all Member States. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Cashman report because I believe it is the responsibility of this House and of the European institutions to abide by and uphold the commitments made to people who live in less developed countries, in particular, the countries of Africa. We cannot get to 2015 and realise that the eight goals that we set ourselves have not been achieved, because behind the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, behind these percentages – let us not forget this – there are billions of people who are suffering and do not have the opportunity to live in dignity. The European Union must set an example and lead the way as far as development assistance is concerned. Public debt cancellation, together with a greater commitment to ensuring that aid is put to good use, is one of the key points of this solidarity-based project, the achievement of which – we have to be aware – cannot be postponed without sacrificing more human lives.

According to a survey published by the Region of Sicily at the end of 2009, 75% of citizens believe that European funds have no positive impact whatsoever, or very little. If we then consider that, according to the Court of Auditors, 51% of resources earmarked to Sicily for the 2000-2006 programming period were not spent and that a good percentage of the funds utilised were blighted by irregularities, we can easily understand the almost total lack of public trust. I therefore fully support the report by my fellow Member. Only total transparency with the aim of ensuring that the public is made aware of the effective use of public resources can restore trust in the institutions. Anyone must be able to know to whom funds are allocated and, above all, to what end they are directed, while also being able to follow all stages from programming to the implementation of interventions. Enabling citizens to monitor European funds not only represents a fundamental manifestation of the democratic process but also constitutes a deterrent to any form of siphoning off of those public resources. I remind you that transparency does not merely mean making documents public: that is only the first step. Information must be accessible and easily intelligible; otherwise, its production will be merely a technical exercise that does not serve the purpose of any democratic control. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me a moment. (The speaker pretends to gag herself for a few seconds, to show that she cannot speak)
 This is what would happen in Italy if a law tabled and approved last week in the Italian Senate, the ‘draft law on wiretapping’, were also to be approved in the Chamber. This decree-law more or less bans journalists, bloggers – everyone – from publishing wiretaps. This is clearly unconstitutional, and is also against the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights which states, in Article 11, that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, as well as to receive and impart information. I would like to use a single example to focus the attention of the European institutions, because this really is an incredible form of censorship. I would like to use an example that is striking, evident and real. My father was a journalist killed by the Mafia and over the last seven years the true circumstances surrounding that Mafia murder have come to light through wiretaps. Through wiretaps, we were able to discover that he died because a fugitive was hiding in the area where we lived. I therefore call the attention of the European institutions to this matter.

 As regards the Ţicău report, I voted in favour of the common position on updating the directive on the energy performance of buildings, because the aim is that, from the end of 2020, all newly constructed buildings will have an energy balance equal to zero, an aim that the European institutions must make every effort to achieve. Europe has a shared commitment, and is firmly convinced that in the near future, it will not be necessary to produce more energy, but to make better use of that which is already produced. Energy saving and energy efficiency effectively represent a source of energy production. We do not need to wait ten years to move in this direction; instead, Member States need to commit as of now to achieving energy efficiency targets, using financial resources that, until today, have been dedicated to producing greater quantities of energy. I remind you especially of the iniquitous launch of the nuclear programme in Italy, which damaged and endangered the health of citizens and the environment. A huge quantity of public resources was wasted on this launch in order to produce, in less than twenty years, the same quantity of energy that we could do without if we were to invest the same resources in energy efficiency right now. Green investments for our children, not radioactive waste! I will now move on to the explanation of vote for the Rühle report. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

 I voted in favour because I think it is important for Parliament to support the simplification and rationalisation of public procurement law. This will make work easier both for administrative bodies and for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which will find it easier to participate in tenders. I consider it essential to refer to the use of public procurement as a means of encouraging paths of sustainable development, by introducing environmental and social criteria within invitations to tender. I also think that it is the duty of this Parliament and of the European institutions to continue pressing for all-round transparency surrounding the use of public money, particularly with regard to public procurement, using all possible means and especially the Internet. Citizen control represents a crucial contribution for using public funds in a way that is genuinely in the collective interest and, as the Committee on Regional Development reminds us, for fighting the corruption that prevails within local and regional authorities.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of Parliament’s resolution on the new Digital Agenda for Europe because I believe that guaranteeing easy and affordable broadband access to the entire population is a strategic priority for the European Union. Extending Internet use means broadening and developing citizens’ freedom of expression, favouring their participation in democratic life and permitting the dissemination of knowledge and innovations. What I would like to highlight is that the spread of broadband in Europe would guarantee broader freedom of information. As noted by Eurostat, we must not forget that Europe also has two or possibly three speeds as regards the spread of the Internet. Italy, especially in some regions, as well as Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Portugal, are the least developed States in this sense. It is no accident that in the Freedom of the Press index for 2009 drawn up by Freedom House,
 Italy was listed among the partially free states, in last place in western Europe together with Turkey, and 72nd in the world together with Benin and India and preceded by Tonga. I also hope that thanks to these resolutions and the principles that have been mentioned, the Italian Government will decide to release the investment of EUR 800 million as soon as possible which was intended to break down the digital divide in Italy and which, according to a statement by Gianni Letta, the Deputy Secretary to the Italian Council of Ministers, is not a priority at the moment. I would like to emphasise that the quality of the service in Italy is inadequate for current needs and that for years consumer associations have been complaining that the access costs are among the least competitive in Europe.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 16 people convicted of various types of crime have been elected to the Italian Parliament and, at the last European elections, Italy sent three MEPs who have been convicted by final judgment. There is no law in Europe prohibiting people who have been convicted by final judgment, or who are awaiting further legal proceedings, from standing for election; everything is left to the discretion of the Member States. Italian citizens have come up with the ‘Clean Parliament’ programme. We therefore call on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to amend the Act concerning the election of representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage to make it a condition, in order to stand for election to the European Parliament, not to have any criminal convictions, including those that have not become final. The Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in the last Parliament, Mr Leinen, undertook to do this, but everything was left to his successor, Mr Casini, who has already stated that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will not pursue it. We would point out that not only is this the responsibility of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but that Article 223 (formerly 190) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union actually stipulates that the European Parliament should implement a uniform electoral procedure throughout the European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, my political group. On 5 March, the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, signed an interpretative decree-law, also known as the ‘save list’ decree-law. In fact, this decree allows the rules of the game to be changed after the electoral campaign has started. On the website of the Quirinal Palace, Giorgio Napolitano himself states that, unlike the draft decree proposed to him by the government in a tense meeting on Thursday evening, in his view, the text subsequently drafted by the Ministry of the Interior and the Prime Minister did not present obvious defects of an unconstitutional nature. Article 87(5) of the Italian Constitution lays down that the President of the Italian Republic shall promulgate laws and issue decrees with the force of law, and regulations. The President of the Republic absolutely cannot participate in the drafting of procedures and of decree-laws. The President of the Republic’s predecessor, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, considers it to be an aberrant distortion of our democratic system. It is clear that the government is doing what the constitution prohibits. That decree, Mr President, has changed the rules of the game for an electoral competition that has already begun and allows those who have broken the law to stand, having been readmitted to the electoral competition. I wonder why Parliament is always ready to take a stand against countries that violate laws but does not acknowledge that there is a country among the 27 Member States that is violating laws.

Mr President, if, instead of all this squabbling, we had had the opportunity to take the floor, we perhaps could have also done our electorate a good turn, since it is 10 o’clock in the evening and we all knew that we should have taken the floor. Every one of us comes here to voice the demands of our electorate. One minute of speaking time is already very little, and shortening the list is, in my view, also rather arrogant.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Gas Natural
, a Spanish holding company, has submitted a project for on-shore regasification plants which would affect the Trieste area, and which has been approved by the Italian Ministry of the Environment. The Trieste regasification plant technical board has highlighted some important shortcomings. Following the informal meeting that took place between the European Commission, Italy and Slovenia on 26 January 2010, the Italian Permanent Representative to the European Union publicly speculated that the European Union had approved the project, whilst the official word from Slovenia is that the opposing sides have been called upon to reach an agreement. This accord will probably be difficult to achieve in practice, because of the atypical background to the regasification plant affair. In fact, it turns out that the bodies responsible for providing guarantees and for safety have failed to comply with their protection duties. Significant delays in drawing up external emergency plans and in communicating with public bodies and authorities responsible for managing emergencies have been highlighted, as has a failure to inform the public about the risks of serious accidents concerning codes of conduct, and the absence of an objective assessment of the domino effect caused by a possible accident in high-risk industrial plants. For these reasons, we believe this is yet another attempt to set up a high-risk plant, in the knowledge that there are absolutely no protection and safety measures in place. Sonia Alfano  (ALDE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw Parliament’s attention to the rules on company transfers contained in Directive 2001/23/EC. I am saying this because Eutelia S.p.A., an Italian company operating in the field of telecommunications and information technology, counts among its clients some very important businesses, but not just businesses: for example, it also provides services for the Bank of Italy, the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Italian Senate. Furthermore, it is involved with the Schengen project, so it manages some very confidential data. In May 2009, Eutelia all but divested itself of its IT branch, transferring it to its subsidiary, Agile, which basically has a fund of only EUR 96 000 to pay its 2 000 employees. Subsequently, in October 2009, 1 192 people received redundancy notices. These people are still employed, despite having received redundancy notices. Moreover, the ridiculous thing is that the rule that I referred to just now imposes specific requirements of entrepreneurship on those who acquire parts of undertakings … (The President cut off the speaker) Sonia Alfano,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the European Crime Prevention Network. This network was set up in 2001 by Council Decision 2001/427/JHA. Its objectives were to facilitate cooperation and exchanges of information and experiences at national and European level; to collect and analyse relevant information aimed in particular at the exchange of best practices; to organise conferences, seminars, meetings and initiatives with the objective of facilitating the exchange of experiences and best practices; and to provide its expertise to the Council and the Commission concerning crime prevention. The Decision envisaged that the structure would be based on contact points designated by the Commission and the Member States; these contact points were to include at least one representative from the national authorities, while the other designated contact points could be researchers or university academics specialising in this field. Member States were, in any case, required to involve researchers, university academics, NGOs and civil society. Even Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction were involved in the work as expert bodies. In 2005, the network underwent its first internal structural reform. This foresaw the permanent establishment of two commissions – one for the work programme and one for research – while the running of the website was transferred from the European Commission to the United Kingdom, which still keeps it updated. In 2007, there was another review, which acknowledged the particular need to strengthen the secretariat and highlighted the need to confront the problem of resources for the permanent commissions and the national representatives. In March 2009, an external evaluation was published concerning the functioning of the network. This focused on the importance of the objectives that brought the network into being but, at the same time, regrettably highlighted the organisational failure that had impeded the achievement of the important objectives that we were speaking of earlier. The problems thus brought to light, which have led to the virtual collapse of the network, included the lack of suitable resources, an ineffective secretariat, lack of commitment on the part of the national representatives and a very poor work programme. The evaluation also considered the possibility of disbanding the network. In consequence, the network appointed a working group to examine the recommendations made in March 2009 and took the view that certain amendments needed to be made to the Act that created the network. In particular, it was suggested that there should be an external secretariat financed with funds from Community programmes. Although some Member States had revived the idea of disbanding the network, others suggested that it should be reformed. The Swedish Presidency of the European Council agreed with this proposal, to the extent of making it a priority in its own six-month term of office. At this point, I must stress how embarrassed I am to see these empty seats, given that these proposals were made by the Swedish Presidency itself. The proposal envisages that the network should be composed of a secretariat, of contact points designated by each Member State and of a board of directors. This board of directors should be made up of national representatives appointed by Member States and would be presided over by a chairman in charge of an executive committee. I think there is also some confusion in this respect between contact points and national representatives. Civil society, the academic world, the world of experience and hence, of experts, are all being completely left out of the network. This is a very serious matter. The structural links between the network and the other Community institutions and bodies that are concerned with crime and its prevention have been completely cut off. The Decision does not envisage any form of cooperation with the European Parliament and the requirement for knowledge of languages has been omitted, despite having been requested previously. Speaking as rapporteur, I believe that this proposal is completely ineffective and is incapable of tackling crime prevention for several reasons. First, it has been unable to fulfil the objectives for which it was created; second, there has been no cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Member States, and I believe that this must be regarded as a sort of sabotage of the network itself. Crime prevention cannot be reduced to the exchange of best practices. Unfortunately, we have witnessed what is almost a type of tourism on the part of various officials who have visited various countries and have often not even managed to speak to one another because there were no interpreters. The failure to involve civil society and NGOs, or to develop materials on prevention such as books for schools, makes this network completely ineffective. To make the network function, I think we should strengthen its powers, and also incorporate the fight against crime and the prevention of organised crime. I therefore suggest that we reject this proposal, which could have been accepted only if the Council had presented a genuinely ambitious proposal. Unfortunately, this has not happened. Sonia Alfano,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Members who have taken part in this debate. I should, in particular, also like to thank Mr Barrot for having taken our concerns on board. Our proposed rejections are not unjustified: they are not intended as a simple ‘no’ to the Council. On the contrary, we should like to be involved, given that the Treaty of Lisbon will come into force within a few days, and I consider that Parliament’s role as colegislator is of fundamental importance. I had personally asked the Council formally to present a much more ambitious proposal on the European Crime Prevention Network and to do so immediately after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. This proposal was not presented. Therefore, it proved truly necessary to reject the proposal, and I believe that Parliament has the right to operate on the basis of full codecision, especially regarding such important issues as this. I thank Mr Nicholson for what he said concerning the roles of victims and perpetrators, roles that are too often reversed. In the few months that I have been in Parliament, I have noted that Parliament and the European Union have accorded an extraordinary degree of importance to the fight against terrorism, while sadly there is a lack of will to address not only the fight against crime, but the organised crime that is at the root of it. It is impossible to imagine combating or preventing crime without considering the possibility of a more comprehensive operation to repress and prevent organised crime and the Mafia – as Mr De Magistris has stated, quoting the remarkable words of Judge Falcone, who was murdered by the Mafia. This said, I should like to make a small digression as someone who unfortunately has had first-hand experience of these matters. All too often, there is not only confusion between victim and perpetrator, but there are governments – and sadly the Italian Government has not paid much attention to this matter – which put victims of the same type of crime on a different footing from each other. Victims of terrorism are treated in one way, and victims of the Mafia in another. In my view, these differences and forms of discrimination cannot continue to exist, because such differences have absolutely no place in a Europe that aims to base its policy on innovation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to address the Commissioner, who maintained that it is not the job of this Parliament to resolve certain issues. I would point out, however, that it is the job of this Parliament to ensure that the Treaty and the Member States’ constitutions are respected. A few months ago, the Italian Minister for Justice declared that he had arranged for the imminent closure of some parts of YouTube and the Internet. I would point out that only in China do such things happen. Article 21 of the Italian Constitution decrees that the press may not be subject to authorisation or censorship. As other Members have already confirmed, Italy is the only country in which the Head of Government has a monopoly on public, and now also private, television channels and in which, unfortunately, a law is being passed that will, in fact, prevent journalists from publishing even judicial reports. This is because, were they to be published, Italians would probably learn about Mr Berlusconi’s part in the 1992 massacres, Mafia massacres in which Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino died.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you Mr Barrot and Mr Billström. Back on 31 August, I tabled a priority question to the Commission. It is true that the number of migrants reaching Italian and Libyan shores has fallen, but this is because the number of dead which the Mediterranean Sea continues to receive has risen. Alas, the Mediterranean has now become a mass grave and the Berlusconi Government, to wit, the Italian Government, has signed an agreement with Libya which unfortunately allows Italy to refuse entry not only to migrants, but also refugees from countries where there is persecution or civil war, such as Somalia and Eritrea, and denies these poor people the right to seek asylum, thereby breaching every international rule and the Geneva Convention in particular. I would remind you that non-refoulement is a principle which knows no geographical boundaries and which cannot be haggled over or negotiated under any circumstances. We do not want to continue thinking that ultimately, this Italy-Libya agreement boils down to economic interests worth around EUR 5 000 billion. I demand that the Commission does not – if this is its intention – conclude an EU-Libya agreement similar to the Italian one, as we have seen the results of that despicable agreement. I repeat, alas this agreement forces these people to undergo torture, because this is what we are dealing with: the detention centres to which they are taken in Libya are torture, according to press reports and also photographs, for example, photographs which show many of these immigrants in Ganfuda prison, 10 kilometres from Benghazi. This is torture, which I do not believe is accounted for in any friendship or institutional agreements. As highlighted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the non-refoulement principle prevents people being returned to territories where their lives could be considered to be in danger or their freedom could be threatened. Sending these people back to Libya which, I would again remind you, has neither signed nor ratified the Geneva Convention, seems truly unbelievable. Moreover, to add insult to injury, illegal immigration is a criminal offence in Italy so, for example, after the dramatic landing at the end of August in which many Somalis lost their lives, those few, I think four or five Somalis who managed to reach their destination have, among other things, been accused of immigration and are therefore now being prosecuted under Italian law. I call on the Commission now to take real action, to assess whether the Italy-Libya agreement complies with international law and finally bring about a decisive change of course by not supporting the Italian Government’s nefarious policy.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate those who actively contributed to the adoption of the report on the Statute for a European cooperative society. I would like to emphasise the important role of the cooperative experience in Italy and Europe and of its impact on the territory, in particular, during the period of crisis we are currently going through. However, I must regretfully note that the European cooperative society (SCE) is not yet a success, given its scarce use: in 2010, only 17 SCEs were registered. This should make us question the applicability of the legal framework. I believe that today, more than ever, simplification is needed to enable small organisations to access information on national provisions for implementing regulations and directives. Furthermore, I think we need to remember the commitments undertaken by the Commission, in particular, to include cooperatives among the financial instruments of the European Investment Fund and to make explicit reference to more favourable conditions for cooperatives, such as easier access to loans and tax concessions. The Italian experience has shown that if cooperatives are supported by adequate instruments and concessions, they produce excellent results in terms of employment and society. Vincenzo Iovine  (ALDE

Mr President, I was pleased to play a part in approval of the scheme for distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union. At a time like this, when the number of deprived people in Europe has risen as a result also of the economic crisis, I believe that an important signal like today’s can contribute to greater cohesion in the European Union. This reminds me of the example of a Neapolitan saint. He was a doctor called Giuseppe Moscati. When he received patients in his surgery, he used to put his hat on the desk with the sides turned up, and a notice placed on it reading ‘Those who have please give, and those who don’t please take’.
