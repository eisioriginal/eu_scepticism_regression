 Mr President, over the last five years I have watched in horror the EU’s endless scandalous institutionalised looting of taxpayers’ money. I watched in horror an already overcrowded UK deluged by hundreds and thousands of uninvited foreign workers who arrive for their benefit and claim our welfare. I watched in close-up a legislative system that permits anonymous bureaucrats to generate so-called law without any regard for the damage they do to the British economy and its businesses. I watched in close-up – (Interjection from the floor: ‘From Her Majesty’s prison!’)
 – this expensive, ineffectual talking shop of a parliament, masquerading as an elaborate illusion of accountable democracy, a monstrous deceit on the electors who sent us here. President Gorbachev was right: the EU is the old Soviet Union dressed in Western clothes. You will one day realise that you cannot be masters in someone else’s house.

 Madam President, I voted against this simply because the proposal has been hijacked in effect by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and Commissioners. The rapporteurs yesterday boasted about standardisation, and yet this is allegedly a Union of diversity. If there were one area where judgement, discretion and diversity are needed, it is perhaps this. This was essentially an agricultural issue, but the Danish Commissioner for agriculture was nowhere to be seen at any time, and that is a disgrace. The reason, of course, is because of a conflict of interests since the Danes fail to process their drinking water after it comes out of the ground. Farmers in my part of the world feel totally let down and frankly insulted by the fact that there are some assumptions here that they do not know what they are doing, and they need to be told. Essentially you have added yet another group to those in the UK who frankly loathe the European Union’s interference.

 Madam President, I have been deluged with messages from growers from all over the south-east of England who regard this proposal as near catastrophic. It will result, they tell me, in smaller crops and in higher prices, and it will open the way for importers who do not have the same criteria imposed upon them. There will be job losses, some units will become non-viable and production will stop. There will be closures in my constituency because there are, in some cases, no alternatives to key substances used by specialist growers. There has been hopelessly inadequate impact assessment in many countries except my own, and the switch from risk assessment to hazards has already been commented on. If you are going to use hazards as criteria you might as well ban petrol and caffeine. Even the science is against you; pest resistance problems will be aggravated; there will be a loss of biodiversity. Integrated pest programmes have already decreased the need for pesticides. What is important are the options, not quantity. And you seem to have ignored the benefits of crop rotation. You have no right to destroy one of the few sectors of British agriculture still thriving just to appease Danish disinclination to process drinking water from the ground.

 Mr President, we all know that the European Commission’s accounts can never be signed off until – and unless – two major underlying problems are finally resolved. Neither of these problems is new. Firstly, there is no certainty about the opening balances for the accounting system, which was changed in 2005, because a year later there were huge readjustments which made it obvious that no reconciliation was, or is, possible. Secondly, there is the problem of shared management, which has already been referred to, or in other words the distribution of public funds to recipients who are then held responsible for both using and accounting for them. Even the internal auditors in Member States admit that that system is impossible to operate. For years, all we have ever heard – and we heard it again today from the Court and from the Commissioner – is well-intentioned talk about improvement soon, managing risk, error rates – trivia! The reality is that nothing substantial changes, and the public is losing patience, and rightly so. Tinkering with the deckchairs on this particular Titanic does nothing to plug the holes in the bottom. If the Greek figures are to be believed, we still have olive groves in the Aegean Sea. The misuse of funds in Bulgaria is reported to be out of control. In Turkish-held Northern Cyprus, EUR 259 million of public money has been handed over for economic development, but the EU office in Nicosia openly admits it cannot monitor or control it, simply because we do not recognise the Turkish regime. Some of that money has just paid for new pavements in the booming holiday resort of Kyrenia, where the casinos do a roaring trade day and night. The local regime chooses not to raise sufficient taxes and takes the view that if the EU is stupid enough to pay for them, then that is fine by them. Yet that money could have been put to good use. Not only are the accounts unacceptable, but some of the judgements on how public money is used are unacceptable too.
 Ashley Mote  (NI
). 
 – Mr President, I see that millions of euros of public money are still being allocated to social engineering and to buy popular support for the EU itself in candidate countries, Member States and elsewhere. We still have roads and bridges that lead nowhere, we are replacing the pavements in Karínia outside the Turkish casinos no less, and EUR 400 million provide electricity in Kosovo, where the subsequent receipts simply disappear. These are highly questionable political uses of public money. No wonder the taxpayers in net-contributor countries like mine are increasingly objecting to EU funds being given to countries whose tax burden is lower – sometimes much lower – and which effectively replace the lack of local tax revenues. Given the nature of these irregularities, I wrote to the Court of Auditors recently to clarify the legality of payments from public funds which are being qualified under international financial accounting standards.

 Mr President, two weeks ago the Chairman of the Muslim Council of Great Britain addressed a meeting in this building, at which he categorically rejected reciprocity between faiths and demanded that the indigenous population had an obligation to welcome newcomers, and that those newcomers had a right to remain separate. He made no reference whatsoever to weeding out the Islamic fundamentalists in his own community, despite knowing – as he must – that Muslims, and only Muslims, have the knowledge to find and stop their fanatics. It was not Scottish rugby players who blew up the tube trains in London, nor Welsh farmers, nor even English cricketers. It was a bunch of brainwashed Muslim youngsters who were looking for 72 vestal virgins in Paradise, believing that they had a God-given right to slaughter non-believers. We are not fighting terrorism. We are fighting a war of religion, and it is about time we faced up to that distinction.

 Madam President, may I remind this House that the rule of law is more important than the laws themselves. (Loud protests)
 Lisbon required unanimity. Ignore that and you ignore the rule of law itself. The Irish are not just 10% of the EU, they are 100% of those allowed to vote and they all know, we all know, that others would have voted ‘no’ given the chance. (Further loud protests)
 Lisbon was incomprehensible and the Irish knew why. Others would have voted ‘no’ given the chance. Suggesting now that the process should go on, devising clever ways of regenerating Lisbon in open defiance of public will, is an arrogance of breathtaking proportions and we have seen it all before. The Austrian Foreign Minister stood here after the rejection of the previous Treaty and boasted about 36 projects and institutions still going ahead; they still have no legitimacy after the failure of the Lisbon Treaty to get unanimity. I have a message for you from Edmund Burke: ‘The people are the masters, not you, and you ignore that and the rule of law at your peril’. (Applause from certain quarters)

 Madam President, my constituency of South-East England includes over half the coastline of the English Channel, a name that that stretch of water has held for centuries. Yet the latest maps on the Arc Manche region change the name of the English Channel to the ‘Greater North Sea’ and call the Bristol Channel the ‘Celtic Sea’. On whose authority have nautical miles suddenly become kilometres on those maps? Now, you may think that these things are little things, but not where I come from. The Commission has failed completely to understand the impact of such gratuitous and absurd nonsense on an island nation, and they are hurrying the day when the UK walks away from the EU and takes its GBP 1.5 million-an-hour club subscription with it.
 Ashley Mote  (NI

 Mr President, it is only right to inform the House and the European Investment Bank, whose accounts are under review this morning, that their 200 million euros’ worth of soft loans to the British Broadcasting Corporation – commonly nowadays known as the Brussels Broadcasting Corporation – are now the subject of a criminal investigation by the British police. The BBC faces a prima facie charge of breaching its Royal Charter, specifically in its failure to provide balanced and objective reporting of current affairs. The EIB’s claims that the BBC’s editorial policy has not been influenced by these loans is simply beyond belief. As a result of many years’ research, not least by Lord Pearson – at his considerable expense – it has become obvious that the BBC has, in effect, been bought by the EIB on behalf of the EU. As a result of that, BBC senior management now seem to regard themselves as above the law. We shall see shortly whether Scotland Yard police agree.
 Ashley Mote (NI

 Mr President, I would question why, if the Lisbon Treaty is such a good thing, it is so inaccessible. Is it because Member States are turned from the theoretical masters of the EU into its servants? Is it because it makes law, rather than a framework for law-making? Is it because it offers no checks and balances to control future law-makers? Is it because it consolidates power in a self-perpetuating bureaucracy? Like the last Treaty, this one gives the EU a permanent right to seize more powers without any future agreements – an outrageous power grab. Such undemocratic powers are illegal in the United Kingdom, because no British Parliament can bind its successors. Mrs Wallström said the word ‘constitution’ was being dropped to avoid trouble with the Brits – too right! We should leave, taking our EUR 2 million an hour with us, and we would all be better off.

 Mr President, this report says that the British Government should set up a compensation scheme for victims. A report in the Scotland on Sunday 
newspaper interpreted that as meaning that there would be full compensation – 
if only! Throughout our committee’s investigations, we saw almost no party politics. It was a search for the facts, despite the refusal of key witnesses to face our questions. But then, towards the end, party politics inevitably kicked in and this report is a pale shadow of what it might have been. It has few teeth and it does not bite hard enough. The British Parliamentary Ombudsman has deliberately delayed her report on the same subject to trump this one, as the committee was warned would happen. Instead of directly helping victims, this one will be discredited and undermined by a deceitful ploy of the British Government that is afraid to face up to its obligations. This report should have categorically insisted on full compensation for all victims, regardless of their status. It should have called for the British Government to reimburse them for their hardship and the damages they have suffered. Above all, it should have demanded that the British Government implement such a scheme without equivocation and without delay. Tragically, it does none of these things. Not much has emerged from the EU for the direct benefit of ordinary individuals in the UK, but this was just for once an opportunity to prove that the EU could be of real help to real people. It is well known that I am no supporter of British membership of this institution, but even I thought that this was a golden opportunity for the federalists to prove their worth. It was an open goal and they have missed it. Over 30 years ago, when I was still scriptwriting for a living, a major life insurance company – 
not this one – 
asked me to write their entire training programme. Afterwards I was so appalled that I sold all my life policies. Thirty years on, it seems nothing has changed.
 Ashley Mote (ITS

 Mr President, this House should be aware of the growing, widespread concern in the UK of the Constitution being resurrected as a treaty as a means of avoiding a referendum in Great Britain. As a direct result of this growing concern, there is now a conversation going on amongst various groups about calling a general strike if such a device were used to avoid a referendum on this issue – that is the level of anger which is now evident in my country. It would bring Great Britain to a standstill for the first time since the 1920s, and it is to be hoped that those now negotiating this Constitution revision see sense and avoid such a device, if they possibly can.
 Ashley Mote,

 Madam President, the British Government’s White Paper on the original Constitution said that it involved no fundamental change, but why have a Constitution if you do not want fundamental change? What other purpose could there be? Now we have Angela Merkel saying that the new version should have a new name, but ‘use different terminology without changing the legal substance’. How reassuring to be so vividly reminded of German commitment to democracy and the rule of law! The old and, no doubt, the new Constitution totally reverses the relationship between the EU and the Member States and between the governed and the governing. Whenever before, I ask you, did a sovereign nation permit outsiders to write and impose a new Constitution on them, except after defeat in war? In my country, the State draws power from the people and it answers to them. The EU plans now that the State seeks to exist in its own right and have the people answer to it. Our rights and freedoms are our birthright. They are not in the gift or at the discretion of a passing parade of political nonentities, here today and gone tomorrow. The original draft of the Constitution did us a great service. It crystallised the future. It attempted to turn a Europe of nations into a nation called Europe. It forced us to decide if we should allow Europeans to become our masters. We do not. You are our neighbours. You should be our friends, but nothing more. Whatever its new name, like the last one, this one will not be a Constitution in any real meaning at all. The first was vague, grandiose, imprecise, complex, confusing and extremely long. But more important than any of that, it was proscriptive rather than enabling. It made law rather than seeking to create a framework for lawmaking. It offered no effective checks and balances to control future lawmakers, nor a mechanism to stop the train. It consolidated power for a system of government by a self-perpetuating bureaucracy and it turned the Member States from theoretical masters of the House of Brussels into its servants. What is different this time? This Constitution is not the answer. It is a 1950s solution to 2000s problems and today we live in a very different world. No wonder there is hostility across all 27 Member States. (Applause)

 Madam President, I believe the Council of Ministers should consider as a matter of urgency appointing a team of genuinely independent, internationally respected accountants to carry out a full-scale investigation and analysis of the audit of this institution, its treasury, its accounting systems and controls and all its operational institutions as well, many of which trade commercially and yet routinely escape the full vigour of the law in their financial and business management. Just take the 2005 accounts: a team of independent forensic accountants have concluded that payments worth EUR 27 billion were simply not registered accurately in the accounts and such incredible unaccountability has produced some equally incredible and unacceptable consequences. We now know, for instance, that the EU has lost some EUR 600 billion over the years, which far exceeds the UK’s net contribution of GBP 75 billion since we joined. The President of the Court of Auditors has admitted that there are serious ongoing problems: every annual report spells them out, page after page, and nothing much actually happens as a result. The statement of assurance is supposed to cover ‘down to the level of taxpayers’. Yet their interests are ignored year after year. The discrepancies between balances in one year and the next are regular, routine and unacceptable. In 2002, for instance, the difference was EUR 200 million. Last year, it was EUR 179 million, which is not much of an improvement over four years. And these are not just errors: accountants describe them as serious financial malpractice.

 Mr President, I must draw the attention of this House to a threat to its integrity. A ruling last week in the British courts held that after granting an application to lift the immunity of a Member who faces specific charges, the European Parliament can be assumed simultaneously and implicitly also to have lifted immunity against any other charges without further examination of the facts. Such a ruling is prima facie contempt of this House. It opens the way for blanket applications from Member States and implies the possibility of applications against any and all Members to be exercised by any future government at its discretion. If unchallenged, this ruling would profoundly undermine the Rules of this House and its procedures. I appreciate that this issue comes to light from a Member whose scepticism of this institution is well known, but I respectfully remind you that I am also an advocate of the rule of law wherever it is to be found. Today, Mr President, I have sent you, the Secretary-General of Parliament and the Chairman of the Legal Affairs Committee details of the situation, inviting examination of the implications of this ruling.

 Mr President, Mahatma Gandhi, that brave, peaceful and utterly determined father of Indian independence, once walked into the Governor-General’s office during the days of the Raj and accused him to his face of the British being masters in someone else’s house. We Brits now know how he felt, and some of you might even find a smug satisfaction at the very thought. However, when we see the European Union and its officials throwing their weight about the globe, like Johnny-come-latelies strutting on an ever bigger stage, we know the end-game. We know where such self-appointed self-importance ultimately leads. I have three questions for you, Mr Solana. Who told the EU it could impose fines on foreign companies with no regard for the consequences on commerce, wealth creation and the protection of jobs in countries that do not even belong to the European Union? Then there is the EU’s economic partnership agreements doing so much damage to real families in Third World countries, and whilst their leaders grow fat on the back of these agreements, local producers and traders struggle to compete with cheap imports. The same applies to the fishermen off the coast of Africa: while local government ministers grow fat, their coastal waters have been decimated by our trawlers, and local fishermen can no longer make a living. Gandhi was right. The EU has no business posturing as a master in other people’s houses.

 Madam President, this report is a contradiction in terms. Governments cannot micro-manage enterprise. Since when has the European Union initiated anything that improves trade, minimises costs, cuts red tape, generates new wealth, creates new jobs, frees up enterprise? When ever? Most governments can hope to contribute to economic growth only by clearing the decks of obstacles and creating an enterprise-free environment. Government ought to be about enabling people and their initiative to thrive. After that it should stand well back. The UK has a huge, permanent and growing deficit with the EU. Does anyone here seriously imagine that by seizing control over company law relating to SMEs, the European Union will change or improve that situation? Do you really imagine that possible, especially as these proposals are based on German and French ideas of a social market? I endorse what Mr Bloom has just said. How many of you here have ever started a new business at your own risk? Created jobs? Funded it for yourselves and successfully run it for, let us say, 20 years? How many of you have done that? How many people on that committee have done that? How many of you know what it takes to start a new business in the UK? Well, I will tell you. Less than a hundred pounds, ten minutes on the phone and you can do business anywhere. Compare that with these proposals. We have centuries of company law in the UK, thank you very much. And it works just fine. We also have SMEs trading all over the world and they do just fine. Most of their nightmares come from past misguided attempts by the EU to ‘help’ with trade on the Continent. Most of that ‘help’ merely interferes with their activities, and the idea of yet more ‘help’ will be greeted with horror. Over the years we have seen masterpieces of unintended consequences from this place. There is the Working Time Directive, which finally proved to a business friend of mine that the EU was clinically insane. There is the drive for a level playing field, the very antithesis of wealth and job creation, which totally depends on finding differences. And now we have got the licensing of authorised economic operators, which hugely benefits those who qualify and undermines everyone else with extra costs and bureaucracy. Even the Socialist British Government has figured out that this proposal is expensive and dangerous nonsense and it belongs in the bin.
 Ashley Mote (NI
). – 
 Madam President, I wonder how many people in this Chamber have had an idea for a new business, raised the money themselves at their own risk and successfully run that business for 20 more years and generated jobs and wealth. I see that not a hand goes up, and yet here we have a Commission talking about authorising entrepreneurs and about level playing fields – which is the most fundamental contradiction of the word ‘entrepreneur’ you could possibly imagine. The whole point about entrepreneurship is creating something that nobody has ever thought of before. There sits the Commissioner talking about criminalising the use of imperial measurements on exports from the UK after 2009. As a consequence of that, the manufacturers of tyres, bicycles, clothing, medical equipment, dairy products, frozen foods, specialist papers, domestic appliances, hand tools, computer components and oil and gas components will all suffer, every single one of them. One of them in my constituency will be faced with going out of business because there is no way he will be able to sell his components to the oil and gas industry in the United States. They are not going to pull their drill up thousands of feet just to check a measurement – no way! He will either become a criminal to stay in business or he will go out of business. Years ago I walked into the office of one of the biggest industrialists in the United States and behind him was a notice that said: ‘If you are not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem, so get out of the way!’ That is a message I commend to this House.
 Ashley Mote (NI

 Madam President, the Court of Auditors has confirmed there is no independent audit of any part of these accounts, including the treasury function, which sometimes sits on a pile of EUR 20 billion or more. I would like the Court to explain precisely how many years it has carried out a full and specific audit of the treasury function, and would also like confirmation as to how frequently, such as once annually, it might undertake such a task in the future. The Court has also confirmed that EU funds are held in the individual Member States before being allocated for use there. The cash flow and interest-bearing consequences of that are important and hitherto unknown. Net contributors like the UK and Germany are at a disadvantage, because a large proportion of their funds are stored in recipient countries. The French, on the other hand, are always holding the funds of net contributors and routinely earning interest on the overnight money markets. How much money has been lost to British and German taxpayers through the use of this system? Finally, I should point out that I have been asking Mr Weber these questions for over six months, and still await a reply.
 Ashley Mote (NI
). – 
 Madam President, I was interrupted in the middle of my speech because apparently you were not correctly informed of the amount of time available to me. I was unable, therefore, to make what I believe is a very important point and draw to the attention of this House other words that are included in the House of Lords’ report published last night, which say – and Mr Kallas omitted to mention them – that the Commission should focus on requiring officials and existing audit bodies to take responsibility for their systems and accounts, and that this process should culminate in the requirement for the Secretary-General of the Commission to sign an assurance that the Commission’s annual accounts are true and fair. That seems to me to be one of the most important statements we have yet had on the process of improving standards in this House, and I wish to make sure it is fully understood.
 Ashley Mote (NI

 Mr President, yet again it is necessary to draw attention to the fact that the ECB continues to print large numbers of 500-euro notes, which are only useful to those who are hoarding ill-gotten gains or laundering money. Indeed, the volume of printing has recently even gone up. Yet the Sunday Times
 in London recently published an extensive article detailing much evidence about the use of these notes in Spain, Italy and Greece, directly for money-laundering purposes. The only possible conclusion we can reach is that the ECB is actively involved in aiding and abetting money laundering.
 Ashley Mote (NI

 Mr President, over the last few weeks we have seen the sorry spectacle of the EU dithering, this time while Lebanon burned. There was, eventually, a derisory offer of 200 peacekeepers from France – even Bangladesh managed more than that, and quicker! Remember the tsunami? The US had 150 helicopters and a battle fleet on their way within hours, and the EU held meetings. The Balkans: NATO was on the ground sorting out the mess, and the EU held meetings. This grandiose, self-styled supranational government finances the people who voted in Hamas terrorists and now threatens Polish shipyards with closure. But you will not face up to Iran! Some summer recess!
 Ashley Mote (NI
). – 
 Mr President, this is a rare occasion for me: I have more than one minute’s speaking time and for once I am not going to disagree with anyone! I should like to emphasise one or two things that have been said and look at them from a slightly different perspective. There are a number of practical issues that Ms Wallis touched on, as indeed did Sir Robert Atkins. The reality is that we have had many potential witnesses on our list; we have heard a few; and there are a great many more that we need to hear if we can. That includes many of the most important witnesses. Another practical problem is that too many of these witnesses have come forward at the same meeting, so there has been very little time to interrogate them. There has been no real cross-examination; they are not under oath; we have not been able to subpoena them; and there is the practical problem that flows from the inevitable requirement of interpretation. Taken together those are fairly serious weaknesses, although the committee is collectively doing its very best to overcome them. To give you an illustration of what I am talking about, the British Government turned up en masse. A spokesman for the Treasury, the Financial Services Authority and the Government Actuary all arrived together, clearly having rehearsed their parts to the nth degree. They hunted as a pack, they stood together and we were unable to prise them apart or to check facts because they had come to admit nothing and to concede nothing. Even their answers to specific questions were evasive. To give you one vivid illustration, they denied that the Government or the equivalent department had any knowledge of problems with Equitable Life ten years before we knew – and we have proof that they did. With regard to the point about shared management, which has been raised by others, it seems to me that, in this case, shared management is turning out to be no management at all. The Irish thought that the British Government was checking on Equitable Life. If they were, they were saying nothing. So, the Irish were kept in ignorance. If today, for example, a Latvian financial services company started conducting business all over the European Union, it seems each Member State would assume that the Latvian Government was itself satisfied, but that would not necessarily be the case. This is not a reflection on Latvia, just an example. However, if that company was outside the European Union, every Member State would check thoroughly. That is a problem.
 Ashley Mote (NI

 Mr President, nobody has mentioned Galileo – the European Union’s direct competitor to the Americans’ GPS system – in which the Chinese have a 20% stake; a decision which has the potential to destabilise future arms production and threaten the maintenance of peace. Galileo is a hugely ambitious and expensive attempt by the EU to rival the US as a fully-fledged global and space power, why else duplicate GPS? The EU has no legal right to set up its own space programme – that depended on ratification of the failed Constitution. However, such niceties are being ignored. The EU wants its own satellites to be a part of future military operations, and is not prepared to wait. Since all future battlefield weapons will be navigated by satellite, it is obvious that Europe will be helping China to rearm. With its commitments in Japan, Taiwan and south-east Asia, can the United States be anything other than wary of anyone complicit in rearming China?
 Ashley Mote (NI

 Mr President, those countries used to Roman and Napoleonic law have to accept that the state governs their lives, but in Britain any such idea is an abomination. Where I come from, the state does not exist in its own right and the government of the day answers to us: those who elected it. Our safeguards against any attempt by the state to interfere in freedoms and rights go back hundreds of years and are protected by common and statute law. No European has the right to detain and remove a British subject from the UK without due process, and that means protection from imprisonment after three days unless a court hears the evidence and decides otherwise. It also means no offence can exist that is not an offence in the UK: xenophobia, for example, can stand as a charge in the UK. We still enjoy the presumption of innocence, protection of trial by jury and freedom from double jeopardy, despite the disgraceful efforts of the Blair Government to fall into line with what the EU chooses to call law. The people of your countries would be far better off enjoying the rights and freedoms of the British. Learn that lesson and you might start winning hearts and minds. Someone should tell Mrs Wallström ... (The President cut off the speaker)
 Ashley Mote (NI
). – 
 Mr President, you asked that this Parliament should enjoy a greater commitment from its membership. This is not really a parliament in any sense that the British would understand or recognise. This Chamber looks like the Supreme Soviet, apart from the flags. It conducts business like the Supreme Soviet and the debates here are not debates in any real sense of the word at all. As a mere backbencher, if I get one minute – determined by officials and not by knowledge or need – I am lucky. There are no interventions, there is no giving way, nor any chance to challenge and test ideas that have been put forward. This essentially is an elaborate democratic fig-leaf and we are all part of a charade.
 Ashley Mote (NI

 Mr President, when I first heard that the European Union wanted to tell me how long I could work each week, I finally realised it had lost its collective mind. And here we go again! These proposed restrictions on the good management of transport businesses make several huge and utterly unjustified assumptions. They assume that business managers do not know how best to organise their businesses and balance customer needs with staff resources. They assume they think it is worth taking risks – criminal risks at that – in overworking tired drivers, and publicity risks if they are found guilty. It assumes that owner-drivers do not know what is in their own best interests. Over the last half-century, social engineering of this kind has proved beyond doubt that it simply does not work. When will it dawn on you that the European economic mess is precisely because of this kind of interference? This proposal is a sledgehammer to crack a nut and, just like the port services directive, it should be disposed of into the waste bin.

. Let the people decide The treaties can be amended only by unanimity. The proposed Constitution has been rejected by 55 % of the voters in France and 62 % in the Netherlands. Their verdict must be respected. Therefore the proposed Constitution IS dead according to the rules adopted unanimously among the Member States of the EU. The next meeting in the European Council must accordingly declare the draft text dead; reflect on the No votes; re-read the questions from the Laeken declaration and go back to first principles. The sine qua non
 is to decide whether treaties require popular approval. We believe that treaties have to be adopted by referendum in all member States where it is legally possible. The referendums should if possible be held on the same date. Supporters and opponents of the constitution should be asked to produce a joint text for debate about our possible futures. It can include joint amendments on transparency and democratic procedures where the working group may agree. It will certainly include different proposals for catalogues of competences where members will disagree. After a year of debate, two alternatives should be placed before the national electorates: On the one hand a renewed constitution; on the other a Co-operation Agreement among European democracies. The new directly elected Convention must work in public in working groups and plenary meetings for a year. Each chapter of the existing treaties will have to have a special working group to allow drastic simplification of the existing complicated texts. Finally, the plenary of the Convention may adopt two different proposals, a draft Constitution and a draft Cooperation agreement and then ask the voters what they prefer. When we have the peoples' verdict the Member States can then meet in a formal intergovernmental conference and take the necessary decisions to be adopted formally according to the demands in the national constitutions. If one or two Member States reject the drafts, a unanimous solution will have to be found in respect of the agreed playing rules for treaty changes. We, the minority in the European Parliaments Constitutional committee and the SOS Democracy inter group in the European Parliament, hope and believe that the peoples of most states will see no need for a constitution beyond their own national constitutions. We expect supporters of the constitution to show the same respect for democracy. Our alternative may be based on seven broad proposals 1) Cooperation agreement instead of constitution
 The constitution is dead. Instead of a complicated constitution and the Nice Treaty with priority over national constitutions, we want a cooperation agreement with no more than 50 articles. Countries that don't wish to join the cooperation agreement can choose a free trade agreement instead. The European Council should establish a working group with equal numbers of supporters and opponents of the Constitution in order to present a proposal of rules which is flexible enough to let them unite instead of divide Europe, as we have seen the Constitution do. 2) Openness and transparency
 Openness and full access to documents will be the main rule. Any exceptions shall be approved with 75 % support. The Ombudsman, the Court of Auditors and the EU-Parliament shall be able to control all expenditures. 3) Direct elections
 Decision makers shall be directly accountable through the ballot box to those who must abide by their decisions in each country. 4) 75 % majority in the Council with the right to veto
 Laws should be adopted with unanimity or by a 75 % majority among member states and simple majority in the EU-Parliament. There should be the opportunity for veto, when a national Parliament votes against a proposal for EU-law and requests the prime minister to bring up the case at the next summit. 5) Bottom-up subsidiarity
 The subsidiarity principle should be controlled by the national parliaments. The existing 100,000 pages of legislation must be revised critically, and the main part must be eliminated or sent back to the member states. 6) Greater flexibility and minimum conditions
 Laws should be approved as a common set of minimum standards which gives the member states more flexibility and possibility to have a higher level of protection of security, health, environment, working conditions, social conditions and consumer protection. We should prefer mutual recognition to total harmonisation. 7) Enhanced cooperation instead of compulsory union
 Foreign and security policy, the euro cooperation and legal cooperation should not be an obligatory part of the cooperation but can be transferred to an enhanced cooperation if desired by the individual countries. Defence should be completely separated from the Union.

 Mr President, this rehashed directive will be decided during the Presidency of Austria, which has no ports at all. It follows a chaotic vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism when there was real doubt about the correct result. Britain, may I remind you, is an island with over 100 commercial ports and the biggest, Southampton, is in my constituency. It adds over GBP 2 billion to the British economy every year and the local economy enjoys another GBP 200 million from the cruise industry alone. These are big numbers. As a global trading nation, the United Kingdom handles more international freight than any other EU country and port management there is driven by free enterprise and market forces. There is no public ownership, no state subsidy, so expansion in the development of facilities and services in British ports depends on retaining the confidence of private investors and high standards of service and employment. This directive will undermine confidence in those standards because it interferes in freely negotiated commercial contracts. It imposes controls that are neither necessary nor desirable. It seeks to solve problems in state-run ports that simply do not exist in Britain. The port authorities know, suppliers of services and facilities know, customers know: the only people who do not appear to know are those in the Commission. Even ship pilots’ proper concerns over safety have met with indifference. Do we really want novices piloting the biggest container ships in the world up narrow tidal waterways and trying to berth them safely? Whenever the EU starts talking about creating a level playing field it reveals a fundamental ignorance of enterprise. British ports use their initiative and investors’ money to create competitive advantage: the very opposite of a level playing field. If passed, this directive will cost without yielding benefit and will slow down growth and confidence. The House should throw it out. (Applause)

 Mr President, I almost feel sorry for Mr Alexander, but I am going to resist the temptation. Last weekend the London Sunday Times
 published Mr Blair’s next speech in Brussels, which included the words: ‘here you breathe the sweet smell of Belgium’s unique brand of corruption, which it has generously bestowed on the rest of Europe’. Then it went on to anticipate what he might say to Mr Chirac the next time they meet: ‘mon ami
 Jacques, the proud upholder of the most immoral state-subsidised policy in human history – the GBP 27 billion-a-year common agricultural policy’, which transfers British taxpayers’ money to ‘bloated French landowners, pumping up food prices in Europe and creating poverty in Africa’. Mr Blair’s real problem is that he cannot say any of that. He has to be supportive of the European Union, or at least seem to be so. However, he knows back home that the majority loathes this House and all it stands for and wants us to leave. He knows the British Presidency has been a disaster. We do not subscribe to your project. Mr Heath’s pigeons of the 1970s have come home to roost big time in the UK. Mr Heath lied through his teeth to persuade us to join. His deceit has left successive British governments to cope with the consequences and we have gradually come to see the EU for what it really is. Today we know this emperor has no clothes. This is not a parliamentary democracy. That was never intended. This is ruled by secret committees, faceless bullying bureaucrats, and accountability by smoke and mirrors. This is the new soviet and it is no wonder that Italy now wants Russia to join it. Mr Putin would feel perfectly at home. Since I arrived here last year, it has been remarkable how many people have admitted privately to me that we should never have joined and we should leave at the earliest opportunity. So we should!

 Mr President, the Member States are in reality the EU’s paymasters without discretion. Whatever the arguments about the budgets, they pay and then argue about how it is all to be spent, which is not real budgeting in any sense that I understand. That is why the argument about the British rebate is about politics and not proper financial management. It is a continuing running sore, only because Mrs Thatcher was foolish enough to agree that it should be paid back by the Member States to what is now the fourth largest economy in the world and, since enlargement, it comes from some of the smallest and poorest in Europe. Had that been a deduction made in London and a net sum paid over, the argument would never have arisen. Whatever the budget, the European project is stuttering, unsure what to do about the faltering eurozone and unable to come to terms with Anglo-Saxon enterprise that the countries of Asia have made their own. You have big problems and many of them are of your own design.

 Mr President, once again we are faced with legislation designed for one purpose but dressed up as something else. Who could argue with the need for control of the use of chemicals and the protection of public safety? Registration – maybe; evaluation by scientists – of course; but authorisation by officials in a chemicals agency? A nightmare! REACH is not about the control of chemicals; it is about bureaucrats responding to the multinationals, both sides of an unspoken agreement happy to exploit the insatiable desire for yet more social engineering and centralised control. REACH has been sold to a naive public as a panacea for a better world, ‘switch selling’, I suggest, of the shoddiest kind. If REACH passes, even as it stands, with the compromise, any small enterprise with a new idea or a product that might really make this world a better place is likely to find the price of entry into the marketplace impossibly high. The law of unintended political consequences already says that the effect of REACH will be to export jobs. Enterprise in this sector will be stifled in the European Union and will emerge in other countries that are not hamstrung by crushing legislation. That will be the effect and it is the antithesis of what is needed.

 Mr President, I would like to inform the House, and for that matter the Commission, that the new Ambassador of the United States of America to the European Union, Mr Boyden Gray, is a lawyer with a special interest in public finance. He has been fully briefed about the level of fraud and corruption here and is now fully acquainted with much of the detail published last month in International Currency Review
. At a time when public accountability – and not just concerning financial management – is a big issue on both sides of the Atlantic, his arrival here and his appointment are to be much applauded. While I am on my feet, I should also like to point out that not a single word on EU fraud and corruption published last month has yet been challenged or refuted.

 Mr President, Mr Alexander knows that I know that he is not very good at answering questions. However, I shall have another go. What is the UK Government planning to do about the institutionalised looting of public funds that has gone on in this place over decades? EUR 600 billion – according to the Court of Auditors itself – has been unaccounted for since the UK joined, and that is five times the contribution that we have made over that same period. On Mr Blair’s desk in Downing Street, there is a letter recommending that the UK Government set a time limit to complete the basic reform of the EU’s accounting procedures so that they comply fully with international financial reporting standards. Simultaneously, the UK should declare that failure to do so within that time limit should signal the UK invoking the Vienna Convention on Treaties. Meanwhile, the UK’s GBP 1.25 million an hour should be diverted into an escrow account.

 Mr President, on 29 July, criminal indictments against subsidiaries of UBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were announced by prosecutors in Milan who are investigating the collapse of the giant Italian dairy company Parmalat. Within 48 hours, a former member of the Citibank board fell to his death from his New York apartment and a former President of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, was found dead in his own swimming pool. Mr Duisenberg, of course, enjoyed the support of Deutsche Bank in his fight for the presidency of the ECB. Given the curious coincidence and timing of these unusual and unexpected deaths, this House might hope that Europol and the intelligence services will look closely at the surrounding circumstances.

 Mr President, the voters of France and Holland have denied power to those they no longer trust, as indeed we would have done in the UK had we had the chance. We are now left with the worst possible solution: the Constitution is dead, but we have the structures and methods to govern a unitary state still in place. Projects have been started which depended on the Constitution for their legitimacy. A European president and foreign minister, a European public prosecutor, diplomatic service, space policy, a European Defence Agency and Rapid Reaction Force, a Fundamental Rights Agency to enforce a charter that now has no standing, a police force and a European asylum and immigration policy. These bits of the Constitution cannot be forced into being against the will of the people. We have had far too much unaccountable and interfering government from this place over the years. The British presidency should take three immediate and crucial steps: to enforce the rule of law in this place; to abandon projects which pre-empted the Constitution and now have no legal basis; and to guarantee that no attempt will be made to implement any part of it.

 Mr President, the proposal for an EU fundamental rights agency is the height of folly, even by the standards of this place. It also anticipates ratification of the Constitution, which is unlawful. Leaving aside the monumental waste of public money, it will ensure that human rights become a permanent source of conflict across Member States as the bureaucrats seek to keep themselves busy. The Charter of Fundamental Rights was included in the new Constitution as one of the most misconceived documents of recent years. A passing parade of political non– 
entities have given themselves the power to grant rights and freedoms to other people. Far worse, they have given themselves the power to remove those rights and freedoms when it suits them or their successors. These are not the actions of democrats. My rights and freedoms, Mr President, are not in your gift and they are not at your discretion, they are my birthright. This Charter and this proposal profoundly misunderstand the nature of human rights and they reflect this House’s obsession with social engineering.

 Mr President, this report claims that the Commission has a political responsibility to support ratification of the Constitution. However, it also calls for Jesuitical schools propaganda and using British taxpayers’ money to support the ratification process. Mrs Wallström told this Chamber on Tuesday evening that people will get what she chose to call ‘information’ about the Constitution, but I doubt it will point out, as eminent constitutional lawyers already have, that the Constitution totally reverses the relationship between the EU and the Member States. Whenever before did a sovereign nation permit outsiders to write and impose a new constitution on them, except after defeat in war? Nor, I doubt, will the British be reminded that, in our country, the State draws power from, and answers to, the people. In the European Union, the State now seeks to exist in its own right and have the people answer to it. Nor will it remind the UK that our rights and freedoms are our birthright. They are not in the gift, or at the discretion, of a passing parade of political nonentities. The proposed Constitution has done us a great service: it has crystallised the threat. We are beyond discussing legislation, and it is time you recognised that you are seeking to become masters in someone else’s house, and that is intolerable.

 Mr President, it is to be hoped Mr Smaghi will bring some semblance of financial discipline to the ECB. Recently, I questioned the fact that the ECB had decided to double its printing of EUR 500 banknotes this year – the highest value banknotes in the world and the Russian mafia’s currency of choice, each one worth seven times a USD 100 bill. Last year, counterfeit EUR 500 notes rose by over 160%, and that is only the ones we know about. The Commission’s reply to my questions would have stunned even a simpleton. It said, ‘a strong demand for high-value notes could be met only by lower denominations and increasing printing costs’. Can you imagine that as a serious answer from a central bank? The reply went on, ‘EUR 500 banknotes are widely used for hoarding purposes’ – surprise, surprise! And finally, ‘there are no indications that high-denomination banknotes encourage illegal transactions’. Which planet do they live on? The ECB must be out of its tiny collective mind to encourage the wider circulation of such banknotes, and I believe Mr Smaghi has much work to do.

 Madam President, I do not underestimate the importance of health and safety at all, but I must draw the attention of this House to the fact that European Union regulations are undermining personal responsibility and, in many cases, the application of common sense. We are now told, for example, that teachers must be protected from noisy children. Gliders are grounded because perfectly safe winches no longer meet new specifications. What business is it of this House to tell a builder that he must use scaffolding to refix a roof tile? It really is about time that the people of Brussels discovered how irritating this interfering trivia could be. Surely the health and safety of lorry drivers requires a new regulation: to dig up all the cobble stoned streets of Brussels and replace them with concrete.

 Mr President, the Committee on Budgetary Control on which I sit does not budget in any meaningful sense and shows very little control. I would just like to remind this House of some of the fundamentals. The European Union’s income comes in an endless stream: percentages of VAT, customs duty and GDP from the Member States. There is no means of stopping this flood of cash and no means of returning it either. If this were an elected government as opposed to a bureaucracy, the very use of this vast sum of money, let alone its distribution, would be far more critically analysed, and accountable democracy demands that surpluses be refunded by the reduction in taxation. According to the Court of Auditors, the EU has lost some EUR 600 billion over the time since the UK joined, which is more than four times the total net contribution my country has made to this place. Nothing will adequately deal with these problems until and unless the Member States themselves independently set up a genuinely separate, full auditing procedure over the management of all EU funds. The Member States are the paymasters.

 Mr President, I wish to draw your attention to the Global Security Fund, set up in the early 1990s under the auspices of Jacob Rothschild. This is a Brussels-based fund and it is no ordinary fund: it does not trade, it is not listed and it has a totally different purpose. It is being used for geopolitical engineering purposes, apparently under the guidance of the intelligence services. I have previously asked about the alleged involvement of the European Union’s own intelligence resources in the management of slush funds in offshore accounts, and I still await a reply. To that question I now add another: what are the European Union’s connections to the Global Security Fund and what relationship does it have with European Union institutions?

 Madam President, if the Germans have a problem with their driving licences, what is to stop the German Government from sorting it out? Equally, if we are talking about road safety, what is to stop the Portuguese and Italian Governments from improving road safety on their roads? We in the UK have some of the most crowded and some of the safest roads anywhere in western Europe. Yet we are now faced with the prospect of harmonising driving licences, and this report makes clear that harmonising penalties for driving offences cannot be far behind. When you look at the disgraceful treatment of legitimate tourists in Greece on a plane-spotting holiday, we now know just what pan-European Union justice can mean! That affected only a few unfortunate individuals, but almost everyone in Britain drives a car. If national courts are given powers to impose penalties on drivers' licences issued in other countries, the prospect of a Greek court banning, or attempting to ban, a British driver from driving in Britain will cause a row the like of which even you have not yet experienced from Britain!

 Mr President, every professional criminal organisation in Europe must have jumped for joy at the European Central Bank's recent decision to double its printing of 500-euro banknotes. This year alone, 190 million more of the highest-value banknotes in the world will hit our streets, and a suitcase full of these is worth seven times as much as a suitcase filled with 100-dollar bills. In today's electronic world, banks do not need large denomination notes: they are of value only to criminals. Why else did 10% of all the euros issued at its launch suddenly disappear into Russia? Why is it still the currency of choice for the Russian mafia? Why did Hussein invoice Iraq's secret oil sales in euros when he was trying to avoid sanctions? Last year, the number of counterfeit 500-euro notes rose by ... (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, the Commission’s so-called strategy is a grandiose illusion. Continental Europe is drowning in unemployment and feeble growth, and has been for years. Has it never occurred to you, Mr Barroso, that you are a part of the problem and not a part of the solution? Why do you never ask yourselves whether all your interference and regulation is necessary? Can you not see the damage that your predecessors have done? Have you learnt nothing from it? Why do you presume to know better than those who use their initiative and enterprise to create wealth, investment and jobs? The best service you could do to the people of Western Europe today is to get out of the way. Consign the Lisbon Strategy to the dustbin of history, along with all those still foolish enough to believe that bureaucrats and politicians know best.

We have no quarrel with the people of Europe: our quarrel is only with the system of unitary government called the European Union. The EU is the antithesis
 of the accountable parliamentary democracy that the British invented over 700 years ago. This attempted reversal of the relationship between the State and the individual has been foisted on us over the last 30 years by deceit, denial and misrepresentation.

 Mr President, at our last part-session in Strasbourg, Mr Farage was warned of the legal consequences when he spoke about Mr Barrot. The clear implication was that he could not speak his mind without fear of arrest or prosecution. Amongst others, Mr Watson said so, although he himself had previously been rude about Marta Andreasen. Many of us objected to this, but we did not object to Mr Watson's right to speak his mind. I understood this House to provide immunity from prosecution or from reprisals for words uttered in this Chamber during a plenary session. How else can a genuine parliament function, or is this not a genuine parliament? After Mr Farage spoke, the question of French law was invoked. We are on French soil but the relevance of French law is questionable, as we are endlessly reminded that EU law takes precedence over national law. So my question is this: had Mr Farage the right to speak his mind as he did and, if not, how and on what authority is Members' freedom of speech in this House curtailed?

 Mr President, the Court of Auditors is a charade: the misappropriation of public funds starts with its paymasters, and that is why it is impossible for the Court to be effective. The few honest, experienced and professional accountants ever allowed near the heart of the Commission’s treasury function have all spoken out about institutionalised malpractice. The accounting system is not secure, changes in the financial records are untraceable, and the new system will be little better. The new regulations which are supposed to strengthen controls actually increase the risk of fraud. The Court and OLAF focus on problems after public funds leave here, and that takes the heat off the Commission, which is where the real problems lie. Why else has the treasury not been subject to an independent audit for more than 14 years? It is a scandal!

 Mr President, this House talks about Lisbon, but even after the changes proposed in the Commission you are still faced with electing to offices of great power politicians whose primary qualification is that they failed at home. Few, if any, bring aptitude and experience to their portfolios, except of course the Competition Commissioner, who has been mixed up in corruption and the manipulation of major commercial contracts for her personal benefit and that of her friends for almost 20 years. I have seen proof of this, and also proof that Mrs Kroes grossly, persistently and deliberately misled her hearing. More than a thousand pages of evidence are now undergoing forensic investigation and we, a handful of MEPs, will finish the job that the nominating governments should have done in the first place. Assuming that it survives tomorrow, the Council and Mr Barroso should know that his team of Commissioners is unlikely to survive intact for long.

 Mr President, during our last session, and after depositing documents with the Serious Fraud Office in London, I advised this House that I had called on the British Government to withhold all future funding of the European Union on the grounds that the British Parliament has never voted to pass public money to third parties who cannot be trusted to account for it properly. You later said that such action would be contrary to European Union law. A number of questions arise from your claim. Are you saying that Member States must pay their dues to the European Union however inadequate the financial controls are? Are you saying that the European Union cannot be forced to account properly to its paymasters? Under the Treaties, Member States shall ‘take the same measures to counter fraud affecting the financial interests of the Community as they take to counter fraud affecting their own financial interests’. Are you saying that those words are in fact meaningless and cannot be enforced?

 Mr President, the European Council should understand that the British people have never voted to be governed by former communists, especially those who helped to enforce the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe. Neither do we want unelected commissioners who hide their murky involvement in the corrupt use of public money, tax evasion and bribery. We demand a duty of care from our government, which is why, last week, I gave detailed information about institutionalised corruption in this place to the Serious Fraud Office in London and I called on the British Government to withhold all future funding of the European Union under the terms of the Vienna Convention. No British Parliament has ever voted to pass British taxpayers' public money to third parties who cannot be trusted.

 Mr President, Dr Brüner, the Director General of OLAF, which is responsible for investigating European Union fraud and corruption, told the Committee on Budgetary Control at its last meeting that it was not his job to snoop. His annual report said not a word about the EU's own accounting system, which has been shown to be structurally fraudulent and lacks financial cohesion. It can never comply with even the minimum standards required by the EU itself of companies all over Europe. Dr Brüner failed to address any of the critically important issues of institutionalised malpractice identified in this organisation by experienced accountants. Basic financial records are not being kept; double-entry bookkeeping is still not the norm; cash and bank balances are still not being reconciled, nor are budgets and expenses; advances are recorded as expenditure, which is fraudulent; loans which disappear are written off, which is both a loss of public funds and tax fraud; and records of assets and liabilities in past years are changed retrospectively, which is also fraudulent. I put it to Dr Brüner at that meeting: 'If you are not investigating this disgraceful situation, then who is?' and I got no answer. I now put that question to this Parliament and to the Commission: who is responsible for what is being done to end the European Union's structural and institutional fraud and corruption?

 Mr President, if globalisation causes redundancies, there will be a shortfall in revenue so the Globalisation Fund will not have the money it wants to spend. Do not fight globalisation; join it by encouraging competition within the EU and learn how to compete on world markets. You want to renew the social agenda via the Working Time Directive, which has two aims. Firstly, it was supposed to provide more jobs by limiting hours worked so that companies had to take on more staff, but extra staff means the extra cost of social taxes, so unit costs rise. Small companies then become uncompetitive and lose orders, causing short time or even closure. Workers then have no job at all. How social is that? Secondly, it was meant to result in more time with the family, but what use is that if the take-home wage is then insufficient? How social is it if the family is deprived of some of the nice things in life? Let individuals work out their own salvation. Many countries have a minimum wage structure and I support that. We do not wish to see the social ills of people exploited, but the EU has now destroyed even that with one of its own institutions, the ECJ, where the rulings on Laval and other cases ruined Member States’ minimum wage policies. How social is it to overturn the way national parliaments have tried to protect workers? These measures are nothing less than an attempt to establish a Soviet-style command economy, and we all know how well that worked.

 Madam President, President Klaus remarked on 18 February that the EU structure is a dogma which contradicts the experience of heritage. Member States have a heritage. They do things their own way, including the way they work. When I pointed this out at the first conciliation meeting and remarked that Member States should not be forced into a strait jacket, a fellow MEP actually queried whether I should have been invited to the meeting. There is democracy for you! The Commissioner’s document produced later that night included the text ‘preferences and needs of workers make it impossible to fix a date to end opt-outs’ – it is nice to hear an echo! As President Klaus said, there is a great distance between the citizen and elected EU representatives, but much less within Member States, which makes the EU undemocratic. I agree, and I for one insist on being more representative of the citizens. After all, where there were but four Member States wanting opt-outs in 2004, there are now 15. Does that not tell you anything? And MEPs had the nerve to call 15 states out of 27 a blocking minority – Parliament is in denial!

 – Mr President, last September, I drew attention to how the electronic data of ships required in these reports could easily find their way to pirates operating off Somalia. This was not heeded. These reports have been modified, but not for the better. In fact, there is now contradiction between them. I will try again. Whilst Mr Sterckx obliges ports not to turn ships away, Mr Savary says that they can deny entry if insurance certificates are not being provided. Add the further contradiction of Mrs Vlasto, which extends port control to ships anchored offshore. So, if a vessel with no papers lies offshore and then, due to extreme weather, becomes at risk, it must be allowed entry because Mr Sterckx established the right of ships in distress to a place of refuge. So we come to the situation of a vessel with a dangerous cargo finding its way into a port by manipulating these contradictions. What happens if it then results in a serious incident, closing a major port? Would the compensation mentioned in Mr Sterckx apply to all of that and, in any case, who pays? These reports need a real overhaul. Finally, the Fernandes report endorses various IMO recommendations. Fine – the UK has already signed these – but the EU wants to add its own fleet database, to which I and others would object. I say ‘would’ because the Fernandes report is to be adopted without a vote. How democratic is that? Whatever happened to the comments made here this very morning that this is an amending House?

 Madam President, a mystique bordering on a religious creed has grown up around this alleged global warming. The environmental scientist has had a field day, but the natural world obeys the laws of physics and chemistry, subjects which I taught for 39 years. The global warming theory has cast CO2
, a natural constituent of the atmosphere, as a demon gas. It does have the effect – slightly – of trapping heat around the world, but how? You need to draw a graph showing how CO2 
perhaps causes warming. Is it an arithmetic graph – I must become technical – where equal rises in CO2 
cause equal rises in warming? Is it an exponential graph – a runaway – where CO2 
in extra amounts causes an ever-increasing rise in global warming? Or is it a logarithmic graph, where extra amounts of CO2 
cause less and less extra warming, eventually becoming a flat line? I suspected it to be the last, and the Hadley Centre, the UK’s leading authority on this subject, confirmed that it is the last graph. We are nearly on the flat line, if not already there. Extra CO2 
will have no more effect. There is no problem.

 Mr President, the Working Time Directive is a waste of time. It has been around since before I was an MEP, shortly after which a minister from the UK’s Department for Work and Pensions asked me to support HMG’s position to retain the opt-outs. Naturally, I did so. I still do and I am in good company with many other countries. So let me trace some of the chequered history. On 18 December 2007, the rapporteur said that a group of countries did not want the WTD or a social Europe. They wanted a free market. He called that the law of the jungle. He said that they must have been psychiatric cases. Well, thanks! Due to worldwide trading and freedom from EU restraints at home, the UK is strong enough to be the EU’s second-biggest contributor, at GBP 15 billion every year. I do not suppose he would turn that away! In December 2007, the Portuguese presidency said they could not risk a vote in Council so they let the next presidency, Slovenia, sort it out. And that is after working it in with the temporary workers’ agency, to help it along. Slovenia suggested a 65-hour working week and then 70 hours. However, the Council’s attitude to standby time wrecked that. Then the ECJ drove a horse and cart through minimum-wage policies. When Finland ended their presidency, their Labour Minister commented to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that Ministers talked big about the WTD in Brussels but when they got home it was a different story. Quite! Last month, on 4 November, the rapporteur again said the WTD must come first, even before economics. Well, if you neglect economics, how do you raise the taxes which result from the Working Time Directive? Companies taking on extra workers to fill the gap left by short working time raises unit costs. They fail to compete and jobs are lost, which is why France abandoned its 35-hour working week. So let us follow the French. Bury this unworkable time directive once again and for all.

We agree that children should be protected from sex predators, cyber bullying and other dangers on the internet. However, we have two objections to this legislation – firstly, the fact that it allows the EU to gain more control over the internet, and we feel the EU already has a near monopoly on media channels. Secondly, we do not feel that the shadowy Europol agency should be involved in any kind of law enforcement. We feel that the appropriate vehicles for child protection are national parliaments and national law enforcement agencies, who can devise appropriate internet child protection. This will have the democratic legitimacy only national level assemblies can confer and the operational effectiveness only national law enforcement can deliver.

 Madam President, this has been batted to and fro between the Commission and the Council ever since 2002: six years. There has been no common position until June of this year – but now they pass it to Parliament like a hot potato. Is this sudden change of mind due to the current economic downturn, I wonder? Whether that is so or not, it will not help in these times of rising unemployment, because the report says that temporary workers are to be paid the same as permanent, full-time workers. Wrong! At one end, temporary agencies use this to get young people a start in life, or another go. At the other end, inexperienced workers will be paid the same as experienced, long-time employees, which goes right against established practice. This discourages employee loyalty, which every firm needs. More experience equals more skill, equals more pay. It is a bad move. Reject it.

 The EU likes to throw its weight around when it comes to trade. Remember the six-year-long banana war with the US? That was after the EU gave special market access to its former colonies in the Caribbean. The Director-General of the WTO is former trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Is there not perhaps a conflict of interests? After all, his EU pension might depend on him not attacking EU policies. Could that have been a factor in his mind as he attempted to negotiate between trading blocs? Peter Mandelson blamed the collapse of the Doha Round on US agricultural subsidies. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! For decades the common agricultural policy has been stuffing the pockets of EU farmers with enormous subsidies. This was as much to blame for the collapse of the trade talks as anything else. Anyway, the last thing the EU should be doing is scoring points against other regions in trade wars at a time of global hunger and financial crisis.

 Mr President, the central feature of this package – travelling for non-hospital treatment outside the home country – is funding by the home country, but limited to the amount it would have cost there. So there are benefits in going to a country where treatment is cheaper, as long as it is better. Health tourists will have to find the difference between the costs where treated and the home country’s base of provision. Yes, travel costs are paid, ultimately by the home country, but at the home country’s own level, leaving the health tourist to find the treatment top-up and probably travel cost excess. The poorest cannot afford to do this and they are left with the lowest standard of treatment. The rich can do it, but they will probably go for private care anyway. Regarding waiting lists, if a country’s health care is poor and expensive they will not be troubled by health tourists, but where it is cheap and good they could soon be overburdened. This, therefore, produces a two-tier health care system. Is that what they call an unintended consequence?

 Madam President, what is this: a bridge over troubled waters? For the UK it was peaceful waters until the CFP got to work and near destroyed our fishing industry. Now you want to ruin our maritime trade. Seemingly the Sterckx and Vlasto reports just aim to use the automatic identification system, with Galileo, to plot ship movements in EU waters. That is spying on the movement of every ship in UK waters, in our harbours, at anchor off our shores, no matter what nationality. The details will be connected to an EU data centre, which like any database is prone to security lapses. The IMO fears that data of shipping information with cargo details could, in the wrong hands, endanger ships trading with Europe. Collecting data leads to control systems and the vessels of our trading partners, especially of our Commonwealth, could be ordered away in an EU trade war. For a nation that relies upon maritime trade to feed itself, this really is the end of independence. The EU would decide whether Britain eats or starves. The UK has the greatest interest in these reports, because we trade around the world – we have been doing it for centuries – and every UK MEP represents a region – bar one – with a coastline. Meanwhile, as the EU erects its protective trade barriers, all its Member States, whether or not they have a coastline, get to have a vote. I will encourage my government to reject this rotten proposal, for British maritime trade and global maritime trade are under threat from bureaucrats you would not trust with a rowing boat. Worse, according to Vlasto, the EU will be able to refuse ships access to our waters. So the EU could decide if foreign warships are permitted to visit – those of our friends and allies perhaps? A nuclear-powered ship might be rejected for political correctness, which could apply to the Royal Navy’s nuclear submarines. Now, they helped to keep the Soviet Union at bay and guaranteed the freedom you now enjoy. Well, if the EU goes on meddling with powder kegs like Georgia or Ukraine, you might just need that sort of protection again. What price political correctness then?

 Mr President, the Lisbon Treaty was dismissed by the legitimate Irish referendum, so of course you need a big programme to divert attention. Hence this new package. Well, it is not really new. It is a rehash of earlier proposals. But it is big. It has EU legislation, social dialogue, cooperation, funding, partnership, dialogue, communication... and that is just one page. Allow me to focus on funding. A prosperous economy will provide the funds, but you have lumbered yourselves with the euro, where the ECB’s interest rate is trying to cover such diverse economies. One size fits all, some say. Actually it is one size that fits no one. In the UK the Bank of England cannot get it right for all our regions. Indeed, the weekend papers remarked that the economic North-South divide in the UK is now greater than ever before. The EU is protectionist. You are afraid of globalisation. Do not fight it. Do not combat it. Join it. Join the world market of an ever-growing population. Encourage enterprise by slashing red tape. Call a halt to the never-ending stream of directives and regulations which only hinder business. Accept the rest of the world on even terms and the European economy will increase, bringing the greatest social package of all: more and better jobs. In conclusion, one notes that it falls to the French presidency to kick-start this venture, but will they? According to EurActiv 
on 3 July, the Commission and the French presidency have both declared social policy a priority in 2008. But if we read the Deutsche Welle
 of 2 July, French President Nicolas Sarkozy has made it clear that social policy will not be a top priority. Issues like immigration, climate change and energy will take centre stage. So which statement do you believe? For my part I think the French will do as they always do and look after themselves. For that I congratulate them. I wish my government did the same.

 Madam President, in A6-0251/2008
, Amendment 4 mentioned ‘mobility for the unemployed’. Does that mean bussing unemployed around the EU looking for work – at taxpayers’ expense? A Member State is liable for social security payments for someone who worked there but moved to another Member State and then became unemployed. Amendment 148 suggests that the taxpayer should pay for travel for a medical examination in another Member State with a reimbursement system between Member States, no doubt using a complex EU formula. Member States may make decisions on invalidity which are binding on another Member State, although complicated by the degree of invalidity, but they may have rules against overlapping of benefits. The rules will concern all EU citizens moving within the EU for any reason whatever. This includes legally resident third-country nationals who have worked in more than one Member State as well as, soon, stateless persons and refugees. In several places these reports claim to simplify regulations and modernise existing legislation for social security authorities, employers and citizens, while being very inclusive. There will be, apparently, no implication for the Community budget. It says that financial and administrative burdens will be reduced by the rules for coordination – which can only be done at Community level – but that this is not harmonisation. How can one have reimbursement, EU-determined formulae, a rule covering all movement and rules for coordination, without it being harmonisation? All in all, these reports are a mass of conflicting statements. If they are adopted, they will need a great deal of administrative effort, costing money which the report says is not needed. Finally, the family here has an identity crisis. Birth and adoption allowances are, evidently, not family benefits. So when is a family not a family, and an adopted child is – well, what exactly? I too would like to avoid an identity crisis. A ‘frontier worker’ is a person working in one Member State but residing in another providing they return home once a week. Well, this is France and I am going home tomorrow. Am I a frontier worker, even though I live right in the middle of England?

 Mr President, this debate assumes that the EU is to be heavily reliant on natural gas for energy. I challenge that, not least because almost all natural gas has to be imported. It places us in the hand of others, not all of whom are exactly friendly. Do I have to recall how Russia cut off the gas supply to Ukraine at Christmas time two years ago? What about alternative indigenous resources? Western Europe is rich in coal, which needs only travel a short distance to a power station. Coal has a bad name, partly for pollution and partly for the extra carbon dioxide it produces per kilowatt as compared to gas. But you are behind the times. Coal can be much more efficiently burned these days, releasing much less CO2
 than previous methods. Personally, I prefer not to see it burnt, but coked. Turning coal into coke produces two smoke-free sources: gas and coke, which when properly burnt together produce more energy than the coal they came from, in the ratio of 5:4. Moreover, by thoroughly scrubbing the gas, what are otherwise pollutants are removed. They are in fact the very same by-products we get from oil. And all that is under our feet. Further, there is nuclear power for electricity. That too has a bad name on account of one admittedly serious incident at Chernobyl, but that was an old Soviet installation of poor design in the hands of operators who tried an unsupervised shut-down which went wrong. Why are there are doubts about nuclear energy, especially here in France, where nuclear power stations produce 70% of our electricity? Let it be noted that Finland, very environmentally conscious, has just approved a third nuclear plant. More recently, we have the spectacle of the EU promotion of biofuels which are now being severely questioned. Biofuels are either produced on new land produced by destroying the rainforests, or on converted existing farm land. The former produces more CO2
 than the biofuels save, while the latter is causing food shortages, especially in the less-developed countries. Of course we need natural gas, not least for domestic use, but the thrust of these reports is for the supply of gas to the EU to be controlled by the EU itself, by way of regulation. Well, if it is anything like the CFP, where the regulations intended to conserve the fisheries have resulted in their near destruction, then heaven help us all. Without doubt, gas supply regulations will be a red-tape nightmare, just when the Commission has said it wants to cut all that down. How else will you produce a situation where the gas supply is split into two: transport and storage? Surely the most efficient system is for the storer then to supply – but no, you want to divide and increase the bureaucracy. The report suggests licences for the pipeline operators while at the other end smart meters will be installed so that the consumer can be closely monitored. By whom, exactly? Thus is state surveillance ratcheted upwards, while energy failure is to be a public order issue, giving the police powers of intervention. Apart from placing the consumer in the uncertain hands of unreliable regimes, these reports extend the power of the state over the individual. In short, it is all about control. Meanwhile it must be noted that earlier this very day, Parliament voted to approve investigation into the environmental impact of the proposed gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea. This is tantamount to approving a project to bring Russian natural gas direct to Germany, bypassing Poland, thus preserving their supplies and never mind the rest of us. Is that what they call solidarity?

 Mr President, we have heard a lot about respecting the Irish vote recently. I would like to hear more about respecting your own regulations. The Treaty of Rome is still the document which governs all that you do, and it states quite clearly that any new Treaty will come into force when it has been ratified by all Member States, in accordance with their constitutional requirements. Well Ireland did just that, and their ‘no’ vote therefore kills the Lisbon Treaty stone dead. You must stop further ratifications. If you cannot do that out of respect for Ireland, then do it out of respect for your own founding Treaty of Rome.

 Mr President, on the face of it, I should be in favour of this report which seeks to help under-developed nations. After all, Britain’s Commonwealth preference system was of enormous benefit to the less well-off members of the British Commonwealth, but then I do not suppose you want to hear how a wicked post-imperial power actually helped its poorer neighbours. The problem is that EU programmes always turn out to have the opposite effect to that intended. The CFP, intended to conserve fish stocks, is a disaster as a result of which the EU, by the votes of this House, has awarded licences to EU fishing fleets to raid the waters of one Third World country after another, bringing poverty and starvation where once there was at least subsistence level. Excess sugar production is dumped on the Third World, to which the answer evidently is to reduce European production, not put it to better use. Poor-quality EU tobacco grown with EUR 18 million of our taxpayers’ money every year was dumped where it did most harm. Now we are told this money will go on anti-smoking propaganda, not Third World aid. EU aid programmes are a classic case of giving with one hand and taking back with the other. The CAP restricts imports, hampering developing nations while at the same time dumping its excess in the Third World. Poor local farmers are thus put out of business, pulling the rug from under the very countries that the GSP is meant to help. Food prices are spiralling so much that former Soviet Union leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, is warning of a food revolution. While all this is going on, the EU is promoting biofuel targets, which will impact on food production in the Third World more than anywhere. So this House can wax lyrical about how the EU’s GSP programme will come to the aid of less-developed nations, but the truth is that EU policies will only help to ensure that the poor stay poor, the hungry stay hungry, and the less-developed nations stay undeveloped.

 Madam President, once again the Commission is getting ahead of legislation. The EU has no competence over education, at least not until the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, and that depends on the Irish referendum. Is the result of that a foregone conclusion, or will a ‘no’ vote there be just swept aside like the French and Dutch referendums? In any case, what kind of structure will this training foundation have? I see that our proposal is for it to be run variously by six representatives from Member States, plus six from the Commission and only three from Parliament, or that plus representatives from partner countries appointed by the Commission. In the latter case, responsibility will partly be in the hands of countries which are not Member States, giving the unelected Commission a major say. Hardly democratic. Amendment 7 suggests that the Commission would submit candidates for the directorship of the ETF, and this causes concern in many quarters. It has resulted in further suggestions as to the make-up of the ETF board, right up to an unworkable one representative for each Member State. To have so many counter-suggestions for the composition of the board of the ETF is not exactly the best of starts, but that begs the question: Why does anyone think we need such a foundation? I would argue that a training foundation is not only unnecessary, it will be counterproductive. If you care to look round the countries of Europe as opposed to the EU, you will find training programmes of all sorts scattered around. There are different standards but, between them, they develop many skills, which is why Europe has such a rich heritage. You see, each country has always produced its artists, composers, authors and so on. Even the small countries come up with, for example, composers of world renown. Each country produces its leaders and experts, its technicians, bankers, sportsmen and women and all the rest of the range of skills that are enhanced by training. So there is a multiplicity of skills, with each country contributing in its own way. If we try to put all that together in a European Training Foundation it would drain the life out of the training schemes in many countries. A single ETF will not have the intrinsic qualities of national flavour. We need variety, not a harmonised one-track theme. In short, we will lose more than we gain with such a scheme. Please forget it and let the countries of Europe make their contributions to the whole. That might even generate enthusiasm for the EU project, for that is sadly lacking, judging by the ‘no’ votes of two founding states and the continuous efforts being made to sell the EU to its peoples.

 Mr President, if the Lisbon Strategy is beginning to work, why has part-time work risen from 16.2% to 18.1% over the last few years? Why has the share of people with involuntary fixed-term contracts and no long-term security reached over 6.5%? The rapporteur admits that EU unemployment reached 8.9% in 2005. It is due to fall to 7.1% this year, but will it? In the UK, unemployment is only about 5.8%. Combating unemployment does not need a policy. It needs a shot in the arm. Talking of which, was the hypodermic system invented by a commission or a parliament or a committee? No, it was not. Someone had a bright idea, and good ideas always spread. For good ideas, read best practice, and best practices are for sharing. Look at the UK’s superior employment figures noted just now. They are better because our best practices include maintaining our opt-outs from the useless Working Time Directive and not taking the euro but continuing to trade worldwide outside the EU more than any other Member State. There is my shot in the arm. Will you take it?

 Madam President, from the report it seems that the EU requires all Member States to reach a consensus in WTO negotiations or to justify the position in writing. So the UK, for example, has to go along with the rest of the EU. We have to toe the line. Put simply, it means that, in reforming the WTO, Britain will be more closely forced to trade with such other countries as the EU allows. But we are world traders. We have been doing it for centuries. We have a great deal of expertise in global trading. For instance, our trade with the USA is more than France and Germany put together. But EU countries do not seem to want to take advantage of our experience, so we are already constrained by EU trade agreements, and that is ruining Britain’s global trading reputation. We are not allowed to trade sufficiently with our traditional partners in the British Commonwealth. That is not exclusive trade. We would not try to stop other European countries from joining us in trading with our Commonwealth friends. It would be of benefit to all concerned. EU countries would prosper, and many Third World countries would find their living standards rising. The WTO was set up to promote trade and friendship, and the EU keeps on saying it wants to help the disadvantaged. Well, one way to start is to widen trade links, not cut them off.

However, we take this opportunity to place on record that we do not favour this arrangement under which Britain must apply to the European Union for assistance.

 Mr President, any health check needs measurement and assessment. For the CAP, I suggest that the measure is funding and that the assessors are the auditors. Does the Court of Auditors find the CAP to be healthy, when 28.9% of single farm payments are erroneous? Does it find it healthy for the CAP to fund farmers not to grow food? Does it find it healthy to turn farmland over to biofuels, just when there is a world shortage of cereals? Does it find the CAP healthy when genuine farmers – in the UK at least – are struggling to make a living? Does it know that farmers in New Zealand are not now subsidised but are doing very well and that only 3% of them went under when subsidies were withdrawn? Since it sounds to me that the CAP is very unhealthy, is it not time to turn off the life-support machine and let European farmers make their own way?

 Madam President, let us be clear: this biomass thing is driven by the alleged global warming effect of man-derived carbon dioxide emissions. Forget carbon footprints. CO2
 is a natural constituent of the atmosphere; it is not some kind of devil potion, as is misleadingly made out in portraying the situation as an ‘Inconvenient Truth’. This hyperactive film is not proof at all; it is not even truth. It is a theory and a very long way from proof. You see, as a chemistry teacher – and I bet there are few of those in this Assembly – I know what it takes to go from hypothesis to theory to chemical law. I do not go by the theatrical or didactic rantings of a US politician on the make. Fortunately, we now have the Manhattan Declaration, released by 500 scientists last week, which says there is no convincing evidence that CO2
 from modern industry is causing climate change. It reminds us that the global climate has always changed and always will. Does no one here appreciate that the Earth we know is not in a final state but in continuous dynamic development? To tax us all to achieve the unobtainable and unneeded is political greed. To turn over farmland to produce biofuels when populations are increasing and there is a world shortage of cereals is madness. To grow biofuels by cutting down whole areas of rainforest, burning the timber where it falls to get a few years’ worth of nitrates and then moving on, gang-raping the precious forests, is criminal. So what is causing the current minimal degree of global warming? To paraphrase former President Clinton: it’s the sun, stupid!

 Madam President, these reports comment on the disparity between the rural and urban economies, between rich and poor, especially in eastern Europe, and between the disadvantaged and the rest of society. The answer, apparently, is to offer a vast catalogue of cultural, economic, technical developments and social engineering provision. It notes the success of such programmes in Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece to relieve these inequalities and encourages similar strategies, frameworks and action programmes to generate progress in affected areas, especially in eastern Europe. Above all it mentions cohesion funds. We get to the nub. EUR 65 billion on such programmes in needy western countries in the last few years, but eastern Europe is much poorer than those countries ever were. So these subsidies – for that is what they are – will be taken from those countries still receiving them and from an ever smaller pot as the chill economic winds from the USA reach us. Unfortunately for all its citizens – the well off and the poor alike – these subsidies are self-defeating for they strip away initiative from people and produce a culture of dependency. If you really want to help, listen to Professor Buchanan of the London School of Economics. His paper states clearly that ‘to help a poor country, trade is worth six times more than aid’. Will you ever learn that? Or, to put it another way, if, in a poor country, you give a starving man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and you feed him for life.

 Mr President, this report is a long catalogue of failure. It graphically illustrates how the amount of fraud, described as ‘irregularities’, is steadily rising and that attempts to deal with it are failing. It openly admits that fraud in 2006 in the areas of own resources – agricultural expenditure and Member States’ structural actions – totalled EUR 1 143 million. It was EUR 922 million in 2003, so in just four years fraud has risen by over EUR 200 million. I would remind everyone in this institution that these are not meaningless sums of money, but taxpayers’ money. The EU is funded by its citizens, including hard-pressed taxpayers in the UK. They deserve better than this for their money. Governments of all Member States should be saying ‘enough’ already, and these appalling figures provide all the more reason why the government of my country should honour its manifesto commitment to give the British people a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.

 Mr President, I voted against this report because the United Kingdom already respects human rights. It is a signatory to many international agreements; it does not need to be told how to behave by an EU that has overridden the results of the French and the Dutch referendums, which were perfectly constitutional. They rejected the Constitution. It has been replaced by an equivalent Treaty that has now been approved even before it has been seen in full by those who signed it.

 Mr President, I could not disagree more with this report. I voted against. Cooperation between police forces, yes; forced cooperation and obligation, no; especially when this police force will have within its ranks armed police that can be sent anywhere in the European Union. We do not have armed police as a rule in the United Kingdom. We will not suffer armed police coming in at the behest of EUROPOL. We do not believe in it. We run our country in a different way! I am particularly disappointed to see that Amendments 56 and 57 were voted down, because, if passed, they would have removed immunity from that police force. In the United Kingdom, we are used to a police force which, if it causes damage to property or violates the individual or arrests without good reason, can be charged with offences afterwards. But then, I would not be surprised, because, after all, you are prepared to ram through a constitution without asking anybody either.

 Mr President, without doubt this new policy is aimed at facilitating, amongst other things, the supply of oil and gas through that region to Western Europe. That would be Russian gas and Russian oil, and you are now allowing yourselves to be possibly taken hostage. We all know that Russia cut off the supply of gas to Ukraine two Christmases ago; once they get an even bigger share of Western Europe gas supplies, perhaps they might do it to all of us at some time. At least here in France they have got the right idea, generating at least 70% of their electricity by nuclear power, and it is about time the EU formulated a policy to promote that right across the Union. But instead, of course, you go dabbling in the south Caucasus, around the Black Sea, with regimes that are not terribly stable; with regimes that may not want us there.

Is this, we have to ask ourselves, an excuse to give work for the Galileo project, the enormous expense of which, if not used there, would have paid for all the roll-call votes in this House for the next ten years?

I voted for Amendment 29, where it states that compensation must be according to national law. I am sorry to see that failed as well. I voted, therefore, in order to help Member State governments, but that should not be read to mean that I want a Member State government to interfere in the affairs of finance houses and banks. As my colleague Mr Deva pointed out, they are signally ill-equipped to do so.

That is a distinct and very terrible denial of a seat of learning – and I make that remark for all the universities of Europe and not just those famous ones in Britain.

 Madam President, I cannot support a Black Sea policy. It will consume vast amounts of money. My country is the EU’s second biggest paymaster, and our Government has just decided to reduce our EU rebate by a UKP 1 billion per annum. Initially, one of the thrusts of this policy will be to facilitate the supply of gas and oil to the West. Two years ago we saw Russia cut the supply of gas to Ukraine at Christmas time. They were just flexing their muscles, and once Russia has an even bigger share of Western energy supplies, who is to say they will not do this again – to all of us? Europe must become more self-sufficient in energy – not by useless wind power, nor by biofuels. When there is a world shortage of grain, it is madness to replace a fuel shortage with a food shortage. My Government has, almost too late in the day, announced a programme to build a new generation of nuclear power stations, hopefully catching up with France – that is, 70% of electricity by nuclear. We should and must do more and use the access power to produce hydrogen and develop the technology to use that in place of oil. If the EU really wants to make a difference, it should fund the building of nuclear power stations across the continent, to reduce our dependence on unstable regimes and overlong delivery lines. Then, and only then, would we have the money available to help the poorer regions around the Black Sea. Pumping money in now will only further delay the promised funding of the 10 new eastern EU members – a promise yet to be kept. Promises – in Britain we were promised a referendum on the European Constitution, Lisbon Treaty, call it what you will. In this Chamber, I now demand that the EU hold a referendum on the Treaty in all Member States, including the UK. Ask the people.

 Madam President, adopting this report on health and safety at work would add yet more bureaucracy and red tape, just when I thought the Commission were intending to reduce that! Workers losing time through illness and injury put up the cost to the enterprise concerned and hence their prices. In an EU of free movement of goods and services there is more competition, so those who do not look after their workforce lose business. People off work through illness also raise the cost of social benefits, contributing further to a rise in prices. It is therefore in a company’s best interests to keep its workforce in good health. Good ideas always spread, so that should not be too difficult. This depends, of course, on there being a free market, but of course, if like some members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs you think this leads to the law of the jungle, then you have another serious illness to contend with. Apparently, Member States which promote a free market are psychiatric cases.

 Mr President, I congratulate the Commission – and you do not hear that very often from up here, do you? But this is a rare example of a report that is on the right road – to Damascus? We insist on debating this proposition, for it seeks to cut regulation. It admits that small businesses are being weighed down by unnecessary legislation, some of it going back to 1960. The explanatory statement says that these unnecessary administrative burdens hamper economic activity and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of enterprises. I could not agree more; why stop here? Why only limit unnecessary paperwork from 10 employees or less? Let us go the whole hog and apply it to the whole of the foodstuffs industry! Go on, make a bonfire of another 100 000 pieces of legislation! While you are at it, scrap the Commission, Parliament and the Council. I am serious. By cutting regulatory burdens, you enable the nations of Europe to throw off the shackles that will otherwise inevitably turn us into the economic also-rans of the 21st century.

 Mr President, I detest extremism as much as anyone. British people do – we have been fighting it for centuries. If you want to combat rising extremism in Europe, look at its causes before you rush into yet more legislation which only restricts; it breeds extremism. Let us look at the high-water mark of European extremism, the Fascists of the 1930s. In Britain, the marches of Sir Oswald Mosley were protected by law and arid hateful policies thus exposed to the light of day were rejected by the people. Across Europe, Fascist leaders were vilified and obstructed. Hitler himself was imprisoned – so he, like the others, gained power. This morning, we saw the rise of extremism in this Chamber with the signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, part of the Constitution for Europe to be signed tomorrow and on which a national referendum was promised in seven countries. Two said yes, two said no – but were ignored – while the others are waiting. In the UK, our Government gave a written promise, now denied. So much for the talk in this Chamber about listening to the people! For the EU are today’s extremists, seeking to impose their will by way of this distorted document. It has been deliberately written so that no one beyond experienced lawyers can read it, with its numbered paragraphs taken from both the original and the existing Treaties, but which do not correspond between the documents. The numbering will be changed for the signing and changed again afterwards to make quite sure that the people of Europe cannot understand it. And this pseudo-democratic distortion is to be foisted on the people of Britain! No thanks – we have got our rights already, embodied in the great and wonderful Magna Carta of 1215, supplemented by the Bill of Rights of 1689. Just who do you think you are to overthrow these democratic measures laid down for us but open for all to follow? History ignored becomes history repeated. Over the centuries you ignored our lead and paid the price! Ignore our example now, and you are on your way to perdition. (Applause from his group)

 Mr President, on 20 November, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I was pleased to support the rapporteur, Ms Juknevičienė, in her Amendment 32 to delete paragraph 1.3.2 so as to exclude the intrusive and offensive question about women’s first sexual act, dressed up as ‘consensual union’. The Commission representative at that time present in committee promised me that this ‘insensitive question’ would be removed and not come back. I took that as a victory for me, for my party UKIP, but, mostly, as a victory for common sense, and I was ready to congratulate the Commission on it. By the way, that retraction proves that I was right to describe it as being about the sex act because, if it was just cohabitation following, which it was claimed to be, why did the Commission representative promise to withdraw what was an innocent question? I am proved right. Now, when I saw today that the vote on this proposal would not be held tomorrow as originally scheduled but postponed indefinitely, although the debate is obviously still going on, I smelled a rat because votes usually follow debates very closely. I was right. The latest version that I printed off from the computer just an hour ago shows as indicated on page 1, Text by the Commission, that a new Amendment 39 is here. It bears no relation to the original Amendment 39, which is an innocent thing about technicalities, but it is the old 1.3.2 – complete with the whole list of questions, including the intrusive question about women’s consensual union. At the time, in committee, I did not like the fact that, when votes came up the following day, the rapporteur had allowed her Amendment 32 to be somewhat watered down to Compromise A, which only deleted the list of questions in 1.3.2, and left the 1.3 and 1.3.1 preamble paragraphs, which was a peg, of course, to hang further questions on – and I was right to be suspicious of that. This objectionable, intrusive and insulting question has been disgracefully reintroduced as Amendment 39 by the Commission – against the Commission promise to me in committee – and I am more angry, Mr President, than I have been at any time recently. I was promised that this would disappear and it has been brought back by the Commission – a disgraceful question which no woman should be asked to put up with. It is a disgrace to women; it is a disgrace to the committee which has to debate the thing. I therefore ask all colleagues to vote against Amendment 39 and – to make sure – vote against the whole of this rotten, distorted proposal.

 Mr President, information on changes in job vacancies to identify labour shortages sounds fine. But surely not just to compile statistics? It must be to enable employers to fill vacancies and for workers to find jobs, both as quickly as possible, hence quarterly. Currently, national statistics are compiled by Member States themselves and the Commission seems to favour making use of that to set up a common framework under a single European Union regulation, option C. So the EC craze to harmonise converts a simple system into a bureaucratic and time-consuming one. The real purpose is centralised control. Will we soon see a requirement for employers and jobseekers to consult an EU bureau? Down the road, does it lead to job direction? It certainly leads to a planned European economy, spelling the end of the dream of an increasingly prosperous Europe of full employment and bustling innovation. In a globalised marketplace, the only way to stay competitive is to stay loose, ready to fill the gap, ready to exploit an opening, ready for anything. Columns of stats on reams of paper or locked on a hard drive do not do that – it is the man or women on the ground suddenly finding the chance and striking quick, before the other fellow. If he wants second place, get employers to browse the stats. While they are doing that, streetwise operators elsewhere are jumping in first thing and cornering the market. Worse, Amendment No 8 – if adopted – allows the collating agency to reject as inappropriate national figures and substitute figures of their own. Thus they can create a false image to suit the EC centralised controllers, misleading the people. So much for informing the citizen! Finally, Amendment No 3 encourages the exclusion of agriculture, fishing and forestry from these considerations. Now, why should that be? I do not know much about forestry, but the UK figures for farming and fishing are horrendous. Since 1973, when we joined under the CAP, more British farmers have left the land and more have committed suicide than in any other comparable period in our history. Our fishing fleets, down to about a quarter of 1973 size, are testimony to the devastation caused by the rotten CFP. No wonder some people want to keep these figures out of pan-EU stats; no need to alarm the citizens is there?

Obligatory PE is an issue for head teachers and boards of governors, not for the EU. In any case the EU has no competence on sport.

Keeping a record of all debates and making them available to the public could help Euro-scepticism. However this will also allow the EU to boast of greater transparency when in fact it will in reality do little to enhance democracy because the European Parliament cannot initiate legislation and can be ignored by the European Commission. In the EU the unelected Commission initiate EU legislation and they offer no transparency at all. I do not support the opportunity to make corrections to speeches (amendment 4) the verbatim report should be as spoken. I make mistakes as much as anyone. Up to date news on the EU could potentially be buried by a week’s delay, hindering the free press in informing the public. A separate note by way of explanation might be acceptable. Therefore I voted against the report.

 Mr President, it says this is a contribution, but it is more like a recipe, a recipe for the harmonisation of yet more taxation, which I quote here and there from the report: ‘27 different tax systems’ are an ‘impediment’; ‘coordination of Member States’ fiscal policy’; ‘calls on the Member States to ... ensure greater fairness in the distribution of the tax burden’; ‘supports’ the Commission in gearing ‘fiscal policy towards ... environmental objectives’; ‘increase in fuel taxes’; ‘establish a pan-European ... corporate tax base’. In short, it is back to the failed policies of the 1970s. In any case, even the British cannot get it right for all of our country. North is not the same as the south, Wales and Scotland are different to the south-east – and that was under Gordon Brown as Chancellor for 10 years. Surely you listened to him; after all, you did at Lisbon last week when, as Prime Minister, you let him keep the red lines, did you not? Or did
 you? Later in the report, it talks about ‘EU-wide coordination’ of ‘direct taxation’. In the UK, we thought we had been promised that harmonised taxes, especially income tax, would never come. Now, here it is in a report. It is a bit like the Reform Treaty. Gordon Brown keeps on saying it is not a constitution, when all the EU leaders say it is: Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Angela Merkel, even our own President of President said so in this Chamber a short while ago. So why do you not get Gordon Brown to tell the truth to the British people? Harmonise that message! Now, that is harmonisation I would go along with. But you dare not do that to the British people because, when they are told the plain unvarnished truth, they will vote with their feet, right out of the EU, taking their annual EU contributions of EUR 18 billion of their own taxpayers’ money with them. What price harmonised taxes then?

 Mr President, ‘encouraging lifelong learning’ sounds fine, does it not, with the EU working openly for the good of people and for employment? Only this morning, Mr Barroso said that he did not like opt-outs, but was in favour of compromises to respect diversity. Those are fine words, but here we are with yet another attempt to bulldoze wonderful diversity into a common, harmonised, featureless landscape. Now it is the turn of education, broadly speaking. However, education is not within EU competence! It is only covered by proposals under Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty. So this is also an attempt to smuggle in a competence by the back door. If the EU wishes to assume competence over education, let it do so honestly, go through the usual channels and employ the transparency we hear so much about. Following the model of the Bergen Framework, setting up the EUROPASS diploma and certificate supplements with the European credit transfer system will require a harmonised EQF level. By issuing qualifications at sectoral and regional level, as well as at national level, this EU proposal will ensure an almost complete grip on qualifications. By issuing grades and awarding qualifications it will ensure that the EU bypasses universities and national governments. The UK Government is in favour of harmonising qualifications. It is preparing for this by placing control of the universities under the Privy Council, ready to hand universities over to the EU. What universities think of this seems to be immaterial. HMG’s true position is revealed by its only objection to this scheme. It does not want the EU logo on the qualification documents. That is because they do not want people to know that education has been handed over to the EU. Please tell me, why is it that my Government has taken that stance? Why is it in favour of an EU project but wants to keep it from the people? Are other national governments taking the same line? I would not be surprised if they were, because they, too, may wish to keep it from their people that their universities are being used in this way. You may gather that I do not like this project, but it is not for reasons of national pride in Britain’s universities and colleges. No. It is because, as a teacher, I value education and recognise that European countries have universities of which they are justly proud – great centres of learning whose alumni have contributed down the centuries to the arts, literature and science, enriching the lives of people everywhere. I recognise also that this impetus to civilisation came about because those seats of learning evolved separately and independently, with each developing its own particular flavour and identity. It is strange, is it not, in an age in which personal identity is being jealously guarded and identity theft is regarded as the crime it is, that some people thoughtlessly seek to destroy the unique identity of the institutions which made them what they are, denying others the education they acquired there?

 Mr President, adding an institute of technology to stand with the existing universities sounds a good idea, but that is not what is on offer. It is proposed to set up an institution with the Commission vetting the board, which then selects the knowledge and innovation centres with which it will at first work but which it will, in time, subsume unto itself. It will even issue qualifications bearing the EU logo, with no reference to the universities of which it has made use. Surely, this is about innovation, but you do not get that by wishing it. Especially this one, by encroaching on universities, will stifle enterprise, not promote it. If you want to encourage innovation, look to individuals coming through universities. Look to individuals in the SMEs, and offer resources to help them develop and promote their ideas. If you are suggesting a network to enhance and spread ideas, do not bother. This Community already communicates across the world. Good ideas soon become international. For goodness’ sake, drop this attempt to harmonise universities and consider the value of the varying contributions made by these different institutions. If you have money to spare, use it to support innovators. They work alone or in concert with small teams. Europeans like Archimedes, Newton, Pasteur, Ehrlich, Röntgen, Fermi, Teller and Watson-Watt were brought on by no institute. They just needed time and space to think and conduct research.

 Mr President, Europe comprises a widely diverse geography, terrain and climate, giving rise to a wide variety of lifestyles and economies. In particular, there has always been a variety of working practices, and labour laws have developed differently. Different people work in different ways. Variety is the spice of life. You tamper with this at your peril, for it is at the heart of full employment and of labour laws. The Employment Committee is properly known as the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, and surely the greatest social benefit of all both for the individual and for society is for people to have jobs. In April 2005, Germany had 10% unemployment, while the UK figure was 4.5%, but then the UK has taken less of the EU’s labour laws. Many Eastern European countries have high unemployment rates. They have made progress, they have improved somewhat, but the last thing they want is to exchange the Soviet command economy run by the unelected commissars for the centralised rulings of the unelected EU Commissioners. Europe does not need the EU to impose a common set of labour laws on all. A straitjacket like that can only result in rising unemployment, leading to the kind of social unrest we have seen before. I hope none of us wants to see that again.

 Madam President, the rapporteur’s first draft was not well received in committee, because he was trying to cut back on red tape and to reduce the regulations meant to protect workers but which, in fact, cause unemployment. We are debating the second draft, which was more acceptable: he had toned it down. A pity, because it means we are to continue with many of the restrictive practices in the name of harmonisation, while all the time that which you fear – globalisation – is stealing up on you. For that, the EU will have to cope with competition on the free world markets, but you are not prepared for that. Unless you learn to compete in Europe, you will not be able to compete globally. Footballers continually practise ball skills and teamwork; they do not prepare for a match by playing cards in a backstreet bar! Likewise, continued practice in Europe’s protectionist systems will mean defeat in the most competitive matches played away on hostile, global playing fields.

 Madam President, when four pensions experts attended a meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in May last year, they were not happy with this directive. They said that it did not sufficiently respect subsidiarity and was too much too soon. The Employment Committee itself is at odds over it. Never before have I seen one Member standing over another haranguing and shouting at them. That is because this matter is very complex, as a result of the different attitudes the Member States have towards pensions. There are different systems, hence the complexity. I am all in favour of people moving about and taking their pensions with them, building on them as they go, but let the pensions firms sort it out. That is what they are there for. They have got the expertise – let them have the headache. After all, we even have a Services Directive now, which is supposed to help in this area.

Cleaning out a cesspit, out in all weathers, knee deep in mud mending broken gas mains or removing asbestos from the Berlaymont Building is hardly decent work, but somebody has to do it – or do generous rates of pay turn a rotten job into a decent one? I am intrigued, therefore, by paragraph 27, which talks about establishing a standard definition of forced labour. Forced labour, here, in the EU? Or is that a reference to the exploitation of people illegally trafficked from one country to another? Now that does need cracking down on, and the best way to do that is to restore national borders and carefully check all those seeking to cross them.

 Mr President, so, we need another initiative do we? This time for island people. Actually, island people are by nature resourceful. They are all still there, but they need help where the EU has interfered. Last year this Parliament approved the resumption of licences for EU fishing fleets to plunder the waters of Western Sahara. Unable to compete with the modern vessels of the EU, these people sought work elsewhere, and the Canary Islands began to experience the trauma of massive illegal immigration. Graphically displayed on TV, boatloads of West Africans were seen trying to make their way across the Atlantic, their misery compounded as dozens died when their inshore craft could not cope with the open sea. Once this EU-inspired exodus began, people from neighbouring countries followed suit, making it worse. Malta faces the same problem of mass immigration. Of course it does: the EU’s high tariff barriers depress trade, with the poorer countries of northern and eastern Africa being hard hit, so off they go to try their luck in Europe using Malta as a staging post. Pouring aid into Malta is not the answer. It is the tariff barriers: bring those down, trade improves and most people in Africa will be able to make a living without moving home. If you persist with a closed shop of 27 EU countries when there is a whole world out there just waiting to engage in trade with Europe, then the problems of your own making will continue. Do I see in the report that EU islands, especially in the outermost regions, might be used as sources of renewable energy? I suppose that means we intend to plant these ridiculous wind farms on them. Well, that is one way of driving the indigenous population away, and all for useless turbines producing insignificant amounts of power at unpredictable times, located on remote islands so as to ensure that much of their pitiful output is lost in transmission. I notice that islands are said to be vulnerable to rising sea levels: another dimension of the hysterical, doom-laden warnings of the ‘global warmers’. It is not happening on the scale that has been claimed. And it is natural. It has happened before. The world experiences cycles of warming and cooling. In the Medieval warm period it was hotter than now, and for decades. There are enough records of these hotter events, such as certain crops growing where never before, but there are no records of islands disappearing beneath the waves. It is about time we all calmed down and realised that minimal global warming is naturally occurring in a cycle that has no input from man. We should simply adapt as nature intended. In conclusion, let us stop interfering. Leave successful islands alone. Where help is needed, for third world islands or otherwise, let trade be their aid. The EU’s protectionist attitude is no long-term help, it is just sticking plaster and that always peels off after a while.

 Madam President, my party favours free trade and establishing good relations. No doubt Europeans wish that for Mediterranean countries, and this morning President-in-Office Steinmeier expressed the view that the EU should deliver in areas where people want it to. But they are also entitled to ask how their money is spent, including the EUR 5350 million on Euromed in the period up to 2007. Considering all the other calls on resources, they might question the value of that, especially when we add funds for combating climate change. Here an enormous amount of money is to be spent on chasing moonbeams, for the scientific evidence is very suspect, further discredited by the unscientific, emotional and theatrical way it is presented. If that classes me as a heretic, I hope I do not suffer the fate of Abdel Kareem, sentenced to four years in jail in Egypt for criticising both his government and the violent radicals in his country. Bearing in mind that we were asked earlier today to support EU action against the horrendous Mugabe regime, perhaps those who manage Euromed funds might consider that some of this money is going to countries harbouring significant groups who have yet to renounce violence.

 Mr President, reading the Montoro Romero report, I see great praise for the EIB and its work. Sadly, I cannot share this enthusiasm. That sounds a bit ungrateful; after all, the UK, which is far from being one of the poorest nations, seems to do pretty well out of it. In 2005, we received EUR 3.979 billion in loans, which is 9.4 % of the total loans made to projects in the Member States. But the truth is that Britain is being loaned a lot less than it pays into the EU. In 2005, even after deducting the rebate we paid GBP 3.6 billion into EU coffers; that is about EUR 5.4 billion. That is not exactly value for money. I have no problem with some of the projects being funded, such as the East London railway upgrade scheme, or improved water supplies here and there. But, of course, the wind farm off the Cumbrian coast is a waste of money. The point is, if Britain were not in the EU, it would be able to finance these schemes without any loans and with money to spare. So we would be a lot better off and we would not have to fly that wretched flag with its ring of stars.

 Mr President, this issue is surrounded by half-truths and misleading statements which cast doubt over the integrity of the issue and raise more questions than answers. For instance, why, outside this House at any rate, is there continual reference to carbon emissions? Carbon is a black solid; it is soot or graphite or diamonds. They should be talking about carbon dioxide which is, by the way, not a pollutant but a natural constituent of the atmosphere. Why did the director of a UK environment agency tell me they could not link global warming to climate change? If global warming is due to CO2 and the greenhouse effect, as opposed to a variation in solar activity, why was the same director unable to tell me if the greenhouse affect rises in proportion to the extra amount of CO2 or rises greatly for the same amount of CO2 – an exponential – or a lessening increase, meaning a tapering-off graph and a static effect at some time. Why does the Stern Report show a hockey stick graph for global warming – a steady rise over 2000 years – when in fact it was warmer in the 14th and 15th centuries than it is now? Why does Friends of the Earth say that incineration of waste to generate electricity produces more CO2 than conventional gas-fired generators when effectively much of the waste is bio-fuel and therefore carbon-neutral? They ignore the fact that landfill waste will produce methane, which is 12 times more potent a greenhouse gas than CO2. Finally, why does the President of the Commission drive a car which produces 1.6 times more CO2 per kilometre than the average sort of car I drive?

 Madam President, the previous speaker has just made reference, regretfully, apparently, to lots of jobs in politics going to the stronger people – the men. She obviously never met Mrs Thatcher! Why cannot these reports be written in plain language? The term ‘gender mainstreaming’ occurs throughout the report; what is that? Is it some kind of political correctness? Paragraph 16, which is all about filling vacancies in EU institutions, says that gender mainstreaming is ‘to be taken into account’. Does that mean specific jobs for men and specific jobs for women? Paragraph 1 calls for ‘gender equality […] which does not set women against men’. Does that mean men and women cannot apply for the same job in case it sets the one against the other? Recital A states that some committees ‘never take an interest’ in gender mainstreaming. Goodness, what do we do about that? But, wait a bit, there are some facts and figures to go with the jargon. Recital F refers to the ‘continuous increase in the percentage of female Members of the European Parliament, from 17.5 % in 1979 to 30.33 % in 2004’. But, then, recital G notes that, in EU administration, ‘women are under-represented in positions of responsibility’ where political decisions are taken. Clearly, we are leading to reverse discrimination. Any kind of discrimination is not only thoroughly bad, but surely goes against all that the EU stands for. Inevitably, you then move on to quotas, but the report also calls for the dignity of women. In Britain, other political parties have women-only candidate lists. What kind of dignity is that? Our party does not do it. In the situation under consideration here, what happens if not enough women apply to satisfy the quota? Do you leave the post unfilled? I suppose, now, some people will think they have got some kind of raving chauvinist on their hands – not so. I am a teacher, I taught for 39 years and I did so happily with many women. I worked for women in teaching, very happily – no problem. I respected them all. I simply believe that women should have no bar to going for qualifications and should apply for posts on a totally equal basis. Anything else, like this report, is demeaning to women, and any self-respecting woman should find this report offensive. I ask Members to dismiss it with their vote.

 Britain is in the forefront of research into defences against biological and toxin weapons and Britain must have continue to have freedom of action and independence in these matters. We deplore the use of weapons against civilian populations and fully support the existing Geneva Conventions, including the Fourth Convention, which already provides legal protection for civilians in time of war and has been ratified by 194 countries.

 We voted for most of the amendments put forward by the GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups because, within the limits of their understanding of the dangers of supra-nationalism, these amendments nevertheless recognised and sought to obviate the harm which a lack of democratic, national control over the provision of services can wreak upon ordinary people and especially upon the less well off.

 There are indeed two aspects. There are disasters, natural and man-made, and there is terrorist attack. Allow me to speak from the perspective of the UK, where we have experienced both of those within the last year. Last December, at an oil-storage depot near London, we had the biggest fire in peacetime Europe. In July there was a serious terrorist attack in central London, with three tube trains bombed below ground and a bus above ground. In each case we coped. And it is more than just a question of subsidiarity. We do not want to become dependent – and neither should anybody else. So, I have a question. What do you mean by ‘European Consulates’? Are these to be imposed upon national systems, over and above them? Another question: the European Civil Defence Force referred to in the Barnier report – what is it going to do? Is it an armed unit? If so, under whose control? Based where? Could it be deployed without national government request or permission? Finally, the Constitution included a European policy on the prevention of natural disasters and on civil protection. A further question: is this an attempt to introduce parts of the dead Constitution into new legislation?

 Mr President, when people work on short-term contracts in countries other than their own, there are obvious advantages for all sides. So I am all in favour of posted workers – but not this way. The report says in paragraph 19 that this will not be achieved by huge bureaucracy, but some 35 out of 49 paragraphs include references to laws, rules, infringement procedures, ECJ cases, enforcement by penalties. If this proposal is anything to go by, I am not surprised that the Enterprise Commissioner is behind schedule in his drive to simplify EU laws! For yet again we have a proposal carrying a raft of rules and regulations, backed up with so many references to penalties and infringement procedures that the rapporteur must be at her wits’ end trying to make a proposal which is easy to operate, fair to all, but effective. When this was debated a while ago in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Members were horrified to hear cases of blatant exploitation of posted workers. This must be stopped, but what were the Member States doing? What were the trade unions doing? After all, it is highly likely that local workers were also being abused. Were posted workers employed because local workers refused to accept the conditions on offer? The key lies in recital L on page 5 of the report, which talks about preventing the circumvention of national standards. Since national standards are emphasised this way, why do we need an EU directive at all? Why is it not left to Member States, if it is their rules that control the situation? An EU directive will be a burden on all sides and produce delays, when all we want is people in work. After all, this is not a new situation. Posted workers did not come about because of the EU. They existed before there was an EU. My own brother, English like myself, was an engineering draughtsman. He became self-employed, took up a contract with Volkswagen and worked in Germany for several years. He had no problems at all, but that was before the UK joined the then EC. So I repeat, we do not need this directive. Member States are perfectly capable of managing their affairs within the existing regulations of the European Union – in short, subsidiarity. Do you remember that?

 Madam President, for centuries British fishermen looked after their fishing grounds – the waters up to 200 miles off the coast. They achieved a sustainable industry by care, not by chance. Then we joined the EC, and that all changed. The wretched CFP, with its bureaucratic plans, crazy quotas and enforced discards has reduced stocks to their lowest level ever, closed fishing ports and reduced the UK fishing fleet to a quarter of its size. Many species are down to danger levels – plaice and sole today, something else tomorrow. And to think that the CFP was not even in the Treaty of Rome: it was invented overnight to let Edward Heath have something to give away in exchange for the right to sign! Now, in answer to the desperate shortage of fish in the North Sea, all we hear about is too many boats chasing too few fish – I’ll say! They are mostly boats from Spain, which has a fleet as big as the rest of the EU put together. No wonder the Norwegians said no! They saw it coming, and with their fishing industry such a boost to their economy, they were right. Norwegian stocks remain in good order. Are there any lessons for the CFP there? This report will do nothing. While the management plan acknowledges the North Sea Advisory Council, it ignores its findings. It is inconsistent in departing from similar decisions in areas like the Bay of Biscay, and it is based on a maximum sustainable yield before that is even defined. This report is well named, for ‘exploitation’ is exactly what has happened to the once abundant North Sea fisheries. Tell me: who benefits from the destruction of the richest waters of Western Europe?

. – Mr President, this report covers ten diverse fields, practically all EU areas, from peace and security to human rights and from Lisbon to Laeken. It is, then, an aspiration, an attempt at founding an embryonic culture. When I was younger I played rugby and I recall a match that was not going well. The captain gathered us together imploring us to have more team spirit. An empty gesture, because team spirit cannot be manufactured: it arises from the game’s culture of combining various skills, of playing for each other, of covering each other’s mistakes and of the post-match social atmosphere. By the same token, it is no use the rapporteurs gathering us together to vote for a European social model. If all its various parts, reports, treaties, rules and regulations, etc. are worthwhile and are put into practice by all this team of nations, then the European social model will emerge of its own volition. Therefore, this report is irrelevant! Recital O of the report specifies that the Constitution should reflect the concept of the social model – covering the same ground. It follows that the European Constitution is also irrelevant, as well as dead! This report emphasises the role of the Member States and their competences, especially their role in securing jobs leading to economic growth and prosperity. It comments on the diversity of the European Member States and says that we must respect their traditions, all of which was endorsed this morning by the Finnish President. However, this will all be swept aside and lost if the EU embarks on the madness of a Constitution. In conclusion, you may gather that I doubt the sincerity of this report, which includes the statement: ‘recommends that Member States deepen cooperation and exchange of best practice’. One year ago I remarked in this House that one of the central features of the EU was that each Member State could bring to the table its best practice to share with all the others. However, when I said this in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs during the working time directive debate and tried to contribute some best practice from a Member State – the UK – I was firmly told by that rapporteur: ‘We don’t want you dumping your ideas on us’.

 Mr President, any society needs an influx of fresh blood, but there is the question of the impact of newcomers on society. Before the growth of the public services and infrastructure that we now demand, large numbers of immigrants were easily absorbed, but now they place an enormous strain on public services. In well-developed countries, massive immigration from undeveloped regions intensifies the problem. Some unskilled workers find it difficult to get a job and become a burden on the welfare state. But we should not try to attract skilled people from undeveloped countries, because they are badly needed there to improve their own economies. Once we saw Vietnamese boat people fleeing oppressive regimes. Now we see West Africans taking to boats and hazarding the Atlantic to seek a better life. That is due, at least in part, to the EU, as powerful fishing fleets armed with licenses granted by the votes of this House plunder their waters, reducing people already badly off to abject poverty. Migration is mainly economic and the pressure to migrate decreases as the prosperity of undeveloped countries improves. We must help those economies, both as a duty and to reduce migration. Third World countries do not need a handout. They need expert help to build their infrastructures and sources of employment. Above all, they need to trade. If communities can sell their produce outside their own backyard, they make progress. Unfortunately, for all its fine words, the EU stands in the way, consumed with protecting European producers. The EU’s high tariff barriers cruelly shut out the Third World from trade highways.

 Madam President, we are constantly told to listen to the people, not least by the Greek President this very morning. Let us do that and recognise that the people, when asked directly, say ‘no’ to the Constitution, not least because they view with dismay the allocation of more and more of their money to pre-accession and even pre-candidate countries, some of which are undeveloped. Here it is essential that developed and undeveloped countries be separated and that these funds are not for European countries alone. So the EU should remember Third World countries outside the EU where its funds would be put to better use. In fact, its activities often lead to poverty in the Third World, which is why my party wishes to put this aid back in the hands of Member States alone. Only yesterday, this House voted to allow EU fleets the rights to fish the waters of São Tomé, Príncipe and Angola. We all know what happens then: the EU fleets rape the waters, putting locals out of business and destroying fish stocks for years to come. What price external relations then? Yesterday, we gave rights to EU fleets to fish Moroccan waters and specifically rejected proposals that Member States could prohibit their fleets from fishing the waters of Western Sahara. Half the people of that unhappy country live in Algerian refugee camps because of Morocco’s military takeover. Now there is political, uncivil insecurity for you! Thus is Western Sahara impoverished when it could be helped. But there are only 300 000 people there; they have renounced violence, unlike some other countries in receipt of EU funds, so the world forgets them.

 Mr President, buying energy from another country is one thing. The political ramifications in this case are quite another, and here it is a written document that matters. The EU employs the acquis communautaire
 as one of the founding principles to which all its Member States have solemnly signed. How can this be extended to countries which are not even candidates yet? The EU suggests going beyond the acquis communautaire
 and overriding due process in the event of special circumstances. What are these circumstances? How short are your memories? We heard this excuse before. It led to a conflagration from which we are suffering still and to evils which we still do not comprehend. You may know that I do not wish my country to be part of the EU, but currently it is and I am a democrat. This House of properly-elected deputies should be consulted and should be the final arbiter, deleting the provision requiring the Council to consult Parliament before adoption of the Commission’s position excludes this House from any meaningful debate. This is all about enlargement by the back door. Page 6 of the recommendation draws a parallel with the Coal and Steel Community and how it started the EEC as it then was. That being the case, why not say so? Why keep it secret? Excluding Parliament, special circumstances decided by an unelected body, secretive motives: all are the beginnings of totalitarianism. No, please do not scoff, because that kind of attitude is exactly how all the demagogues and dictators down the ages got away with it.

 Mr President, the report on employment policies is over-laden with key phrases, the tone for which is set very early on: legislation, EC monitors and enforcement. Then we have got the special importance of younger and older workers; then the EU without barriers – remove them, it says – with clear and measurable priorities; review the guidelines every three years, but Parliament must be more active between times; examine Member States’ national reform programmes. Well, let us do that. The French took a 35-hour working week, not a 48-hour week. But when the Working Time Directive was given flesh last year, many of their workers protested at EU interference. Port workers protested earlier this year at more EU interference. French cities are now under siege due to new youth employment policies. Who is going to tell Mr Chirac or Mr de Villepin that they are wrong, they are not conforming to guidelines? Of course you will not. The French will govern themselves, as all of us should do, as grown-up democracies. But most sinister of all in this report is Guideline 19: continual review of incentives and disincentives resulting from the tax and benefits systems. Already a colleague has spoken this morning of a single fiscal policy. Is this the start of EU harmonisation of tax policy across the Union – something they said would never happen? Ladies and gentlemen, your tax systems are under threat. You have been warned!

 Mr President, I am astonished that there should be a report on this at all. I thought the EU was all about the free movement of goods, services and labour. What do we find? When the ten new Member States joined in 2004, they did not get parity. Only three Member States of the previous EU of 15 admitted their workers without restriction: Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. This becomes very odd when you consider that these are three of the most reluctant EU Member States. Ireland rejected the Nice Treaty the first time and only accepted it later due to impressive gerrymandering in a second referendum. Sweden only joined the EU after a bare 1% majority in its referendum. As for the United Kingdom, you know all about us. None of you exactly welcomed Prime Minister Blair last December, at the end of what you all considered to have been a rotten United Kingdom Presidency. You were right. You even threw out his seven-year budget – his precious rescue attempt – with an overwhelming vote on the Böge report. So I am now in the very happy position of saying to you: do as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden have done. Never mind transitional arrangements; obey your own rules; open your borders; take your share of, say, Polish workers – in the United Kingdom we have 250 000 of them, and they are not all plumbers.

 Mr President, I see that this afternoon we are to debate the European footwear sector. I use that as a restructuring example, since I live in Northampton, at one time the capital of British shoe-making. During the last 40 years the seven or eight big household names, the labour-intensive shoemakers in Northampton, have declined to barely one, while all the town’s engineering firms have gone. At the same time, the town has doubled in size and there are twice as many jobseekers, but there has been no unemployment problem. The rate in Northampton is currently a little less than the UK average of 5.5%, which is the lowest in the EU – Sweden and Denmark apart. So, how did we do it? How did we restructure? It was not done with EU schemes: this all began before the UK joined the then EC. Nor were EU funds involved. We did it by ourselves, by making our town attractive to the service sector. Barclaycard, for example, which is one of the biggest credit card companies, has had its headquarters in the town for a very long time. I know you do not like this self-help approach: it does not lend itself to EU interference, rules and regulations and the grand handing back of a country’s own money via unelected regional assemblies and development agencies. Only yesterday Mr Schulz complained that the elected MEPs in this House did not have as much say as the Council and the unelected Commission. So let us cancel Lisbon mark 2 and let national governments and local councils of Member States do the job they were democratically elected to do.

 Mr President, the common fisheries policy affects the UK more than many other Member States. A UK minister in the late 1940s once remarked that Britain’s economy was safe for years to come because, he said, we live on an island of coal, surrounded by fish. The coal is still there, if we care to use it, but the fish have almost gone, due to the disaster that is common fisheries policy. Designed to conserve fish stocks, this misbegotten scheme has reduced some species to near extinction. Among the most depleted are the plentiful stocks once found in the North Sea and Irish Box, up until 1973 the exclusive province of British fishermen who looked after the fishing grounds and reaped a rich harvest. Then we joined the common market and the CFP, and now these seas are a marine desert in the making, if not already so. Fair shares for all under the CFP, do I hear? If so, why does Britain have lower quotas in the waters around our shores than some other countries from further afield? And what does it profit anyone to fish our waters out? Too many boats taking too few fish is the cry. Just so. Under the CFP vast fleets of trawlers from countries previously excluded are rapaciously fishing these grounds to extinction, while fertiliser factory ships vacuum up vast quantities of marine life on the seabed, destroying the bottom of the food chain. How could any sane person devise the CFP scheme of quotas resulting in fish caught in excess being thrown back? Do you not know that the discarded fish are dead when they are thrown back? Do you not know that for some species the annual weight of useless discards is as much as the weight of the fish legally landed? Compare that to Norway and Iceland who both refused to join the EU: their fish stocks remain plentiful and their fishing industries flourish because they look after them, forbidding discards. Meanwhile, the British fishing fleet has sunk to less than a quarter of its previous size. Destruction of the fishing industry means that the fishermen are out of work and on benefit. It means that fishing ports are in terminal decline, so structural funds are poured in. It means that the social and economic fabric around the ports declines, while the EU claims to be combating this particular misery. If you think this is a purely British complaint, think again. The fishing industry is a factor in the UK’s GDP to which contributions to the EU budget are geared, and that comes on top of the destruction of a priceless natural resource. And so, another Christmas goose reduces its output of golden eggs!
 Derek Roland Clark,

. – Mr President, the Court of Auditors recently remarked that 90% of EU activity is open to fraud. So, we come to the award of fishing rights to the EU fleets in waters around the Seychelles. A loophole exists in these agreements, whereby EU fleet owners have been known to complete a trawler’s fishing to gain full hulls, and then declare technical problems. They are then allowed to replace this trawler with a new one on the same licence, so they get two trawlers full for the price of one. It does not stop there: they repeat it time and again, on the same licence, citing this bogus technical problem several times over – and one wonders why fish stocks are depleted! The second half of this scam is to declare ‘zero catch’, so there are no EU contributions to the country in question, and deprivation becomes acute. People from several African countries say that everyone knows the huge fraud taking place in their waters under these EU agreements. On top of that, we have the new Seychelles agreement, following the agreements for Martinique, Madagascar and the Cape Verde Islands, agreed and approved in this House within the last year – and may I say, to the shame of this House. Modern, big EU trawlers force these local fishermen out of business, landing catches at prices with which they cannot compete. A good slice of the economy of a third world country is destroyed, all because EU fleets, due to their reckless rape of their own seas, now move on to other targets. I note that Commissioner Borg disagreed with me in my last speech, saying that the problem was over-fishing, which is precisely what I said in my own comments. It is not long before the new waters around these islands are fished out. The EU trawlers then move on, leaving a deeply wounded economy: fishermen out of work and waters deprived of stock, so that the locals cannot restart properly. And the EU says it wants to help the third world!

 Mr President, I understand that the Commission is to require the British Merchant Navy to fly the European flag instead of the Red Ensign, which is known affectionately throughout Britain as the ‘Red Duster’ and is a symbol of Britain’s identity. So much for the repeated statement that membership of the EU does not mean a loss of national identity! I have already advised the chairman of the Merchant Navy Association – a captain in the Merchant Navy in his own right – that should this come into force, it should be disregarded and the European flag thrown overboard. What then? An attempt to board British merchant ships? I think not. Why not pick an easy target, one that does not move about? Just a few minutes from here, a great Belgian flag was proudly flying this very day – and rightly so – under the Cinquantenaire. Why not tear that one down, replace it with the European flag and see what the Belgian people say?

 Here we go again. Another EU import tariff scheme has come unstuck: recently sugar, now bananas, and all for pan-EU harmony. This scheme is hampered by the origins of Member States, many of whose former colonies produce bananas and whom they now rightly wish to assist. Although complex, the three-tariff system helped, with the C quota reserved for ACP countries to export up to 750 000 tonnes annually to the EU at zero rate. Hence the problem: because non-EU countries, especially Latin America, now want parity. I suggest two solutions. We can go to tariff only, as proposed for 2006. In October 2004, EUR 230 per tonne was suggested, but that was too low for ACP and too high for dollar countries. However a common tariff is set up, it will disadvantage ACP countries, causing loss of production and unemployment. Already the Windward Isles report that 24 000 small producers have dropped to 7 000 under dollar-country pressure. In many ACP countries bananas grow in terrain unsuitable for other crops, so unemployment grows massively. Will these people migrate, some to Europe adding to our 20 million unemployed, or will they take to crops like cocaine that will grow on the former banana plantations? I suggest an alternative solution based on the repeated statements that we are supposed to be in an EU which retains its individual Member State status. Mr Barroso recently claimed that regulations might be cut. Combine the two: ditch the banana import scheme and make individual Member States sort themselves out with their own arrangements. After all, we are all grown-up democracies. EU countries would buy on the open market or support their former colonies just as they wish, without repercussions on the world market. The UK operated Commonwealth preference up to 1972 without great problems. If that sounds a little nostalgic, well, why not? We owe these former colonies. What is wrong with a little humanity in trying to maintain employment in the Third World? Rather that than the arid scratchings of the bureaucratic Brussels pen-pusher.

 Mr President, having worked a 13-hour day, I will soon be contravening the Working Time Directive. I am on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, so perhaps I will report to the chairman, but I will cope, which is more than millions of people in the Indian sub-continent can say. Here we have the astonishing spectacle of the EU pouring funds into the three SEI organisations, relocating thousands of jobs in the call centre software services sector to India, just part of the relocation of so many jobs to Asia. That it makes European unemployment worse is not the point. What is relevant is the reason for the job relocation. We all know why: cheaper products, primarily because workers in that part of the world are paid less than European workers, which means less than the legal minimum European rate. If that is not the case, there is no reason to relocate in the first place. They will also have longer working hours, actually promoted by three SEIs. Mr Menéndez del Valle actually boasts of up to five-and-a-half hours more per day available. Worse, he admits to unemployment abuses in India, including child labour. So we have cheaper products by breaking EU rules for wages and for the hours worked by employees who, I have no doubt, are often working in circumstances which an EU health and safety inspector would shut down. In short, the EU is exploiting sweated labour, the same evil practice it is so keen to eradicate here. What a disgrace!

 Mr President, employment and social solidarity go together. The greatest social benefit, the greatest solidarity, is for people to have jobs. However, fuller employment will not come about through bureaucratic plans and schemes such as Lisbon, which the rapporteur and others seem to think will help and which is now discredited, surely: halfway through its time span and less than half implemented. Employment is encouraged by removing restraints and scrapping regulations. I point out again in this House that those countries that have not adopted the euro have the lowest levels of unemployment. However, it goes deeper. In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in July, David Blunkett, the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said that we must not work against Member States, that different countries have different solutions and that defining best practice is the first step. Therefore, we must observe what others do and learn from each other, taking and adapting from each other what suits best. We must not conjure up new projects with ever increasing budgets. The rapporteur rightly says that red tape must be cut through but is sceptical about the European Union's ability to do so. Likewise, David Blunkett said that many regulations were being passed which were impossible to implement. Just so: the first measure to be discarded is this well-meaning but artificial attempt to create social solidarity. I voted against it in committee and I ask this House to do the same.

 UKIP MEPs voted AGAINST Amendment 37 because the Working Time Directive is already operating and will continue. We therefore aim to mitigate its worst aspects. Currently it is possible to opt-out of the 48-hour week by way of either an individual, or a group, signing an agreement with the employer. The European Commission wishes to retain the opt-outs, the CERCAS report eliminates them. Amendment 37 was listed as, ‘Proposal to reject the Commission proposal’.

 Madam President, the working time directive is to provide a better deal for workers and improve family life; but will it? The best deal a worker can get is to have a job, and this directive will not improve employment or social life. I understand that the central objective of the EU is for each Member State to bring to the table its experience and skills, its best practice and ideas, share with the rest and strengthen all. So, allow this UK representative to bring to the table today some UK experience and practice: that less regulation equals more employment. Even Mr Špidla agreed with me on that to some degree a short while ago. Denmark and Sweden apart, the United Kingdom has the lowest unemployment rate in the whole EU, way below the average EU rate. These countries have not taken the euro and the UK has not indulged in the more restrictive employment practices. The 48-hour week, rigidly enforced, will cause small firms to close or drive people into the black economy, where they are outside of all protection and where they will become avoiders of income tax and VAT. Flexibility can be provided by the opt-outs from the working week, which are due to be phased out in spite of a vote in this House on 24 February. Organisations like the United Kingdom Government, the chambers of commerce, EuroCommerce and Sky TV all want the opt outs to continue, but these bodies do not work in the pseudo-EU world of fancy plans and dead-hand regulation – they work in the real world of profit margins and of full employment as produced by the 48-hour opt out.

 Mr President, after all that Mr Juncker said a month ago in this House and elsewhere to the effect that the Stability and Growth Pact was dead or at best needed to stagger on as it was, we now hear from the European Council that it lives again. Lazarus indeed strikes once more. But it is not living, it is fudging. In a year’s time this rotten pact will have to be fudged or dumped, as I suggested last time. The meeting, however, was remarkable for something which it did not discuss: the UK’s budget rebate. Mr Chirac at least commented on it after the meeting, saying to reporters that it could no longer be justified, that it was from the past. Mr Barroso echoed those statements. Perhaps you would like to justify the fact that the UK would pay into the EU 14 times more than France without the rebate, and, even with it, two-and-a-half times the French contribution. Mr Barroso also said that 70% of Commission spending was on agriculture when the rebate was agreed, whereas new proposals would reduce it to one-third. In fact, the proposals are that three-quarters of future spending will go to agriculture in poor regions. That is where the Commission’s priorities lie. That is of no comfort to the UK, rebate or no. Our Foreign Secretary said that the Commission’s proposal could mean a 35% hike in the budget, but he said our rebate remains a veto. We have an election in the UK on 5 May. I would advise you not to try to join the flight from London to Brussels the following day. You would be caught up with party officials and government ministers, of whatever colour, as they rush over here to seek a compromise. It will be a milestone on the way to Britain’s exit. Worse is better because, in monetary terms, the EU will then be 14 times as bad for the UK as for France. Heaven knows, even with Mr Chirac’s desperate efforts, current polls show that the EU is becoming less popular in France every day.

 Mr President, before I move on to the Stability and Growth Pact, I would like to make a comment or two about the financial situation in general. I am a little disappointed to see that Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, seems to have disappeared, because he is going to hear a comment from a representative of the United Kingdom, which is the second biggest contributor to European Union funds. To date, we have contributed some GBP 180 billion. We have received back around GBP 105 billion by way of subsidies of one form or another. Well, we believe that very soon there is to be a general election in the United Kingdom, and I think the voters are going to want to know what has happened to that GBP 75 billion deficit in our contributions. Is there going to be an answer from our current Prime Minister or Chancellor of the Exchequer? Is there going to be an answer from this House? When we remind them that the European Court of Auditors has, for the tenth year running, refused to sign the books because billions of pounds have gone missing, they might well put two and two together as regards what has happened to our 75 billion. Have we got a Stability and Growth Pact or not? The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, recently said to reporters in Brussels: ‘I am beginning to seriously consider the option of not changing the Pact at all’. He added: ‘We are not excluding the scenario of leaving the Pact as it is; that is now a distinct possibility. I have no goal of replacing a Pact that does not work well with one that seems to function but goes wrong later’. Previously he had said that the Pact was dead. So what about this Stability and Growth Pact? Is it not ludicrous that countries that run up a deficit of over 3% are then fined enormous sums of money, making their position worse? Of course the Stability Pact is wrong. It is useless! Dump it!

 Mr President, the social situation is dependent on employment. There is a certain difference in outlook between Mrs Figueiredo's report and the Barroso Commission. The report, if adopted, would lead to further initiatives and pressure to press on with the Lisbon agenda. The Commission seems to be heading the other way, towards a freer structure. Recently it proposed that 80% of resources be managed in a decentralised way. If competencies were indeed to be restored to the nation state, the UK Independence Party might be persuaded to support the Commission. This is because the UK was drawn into what was then the EC on the promise that it was not leading to a federal state, but that it was simply about trade. If only that were so. One thing is certain: the UK has half the average unemployment rate of the EU as a whole. Along with Sweden and Denmark we have the lowest levels of unemployment. Governments do not produce that. They simply make the conditions right for employment to flourish. The single most important factor is the common currency. Sweden, Denmark and the UK have not adopted the single currency, so they are not saddled with a single interest rate. Even in the UK there is a disparity of economies. The Bank of England cannot set an interest rate suitable for the whole country. How then can the European Central Bank set a common interest rate suitable for a Europe with widely varying economies arising from such great geographical diversity and widely differing ways of life? Along with my colleagues, I shall vote against this report.

 Mr President, in his article in the current issue of Parliament’s magazine, Mr De Rossa stated that his resolution was carried unanimously in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. But the record shows that one Member voted against. That was me, and I intend to do so again this week with my UKIP colleagues. Let me explain. At the centre of Mr De Rossa’s report is a stand-off between the Commission and the Council over the exportability of five benefits, three from the United Kingdom. Mr De Rossa suggests that the report should be adopted without delay, so that Regulation 1408/71 can be tidied up. Then he proposes that the European Court of Justice resolve the dispute over the five benefits. We believe that the decision on the United Kingdom benefit should be left to Her Majesty’s Government, which does not want them to be exportable. Indeed, the Council’s previously stated common position upholds that of Her Majesty’s Government. We therefore deplore the Commission’s change of mind. We believe that it should be for each Member State to define the basis on which its benefits are to be paid and to whom. We absolutely oppose the notion that the deadlock should be resolved by the European Court of Justice. Benefits are part of taxation systems. They are dual systems: taking from and giving back. To interfere in either is to interfere in the taxation system as a whole. Since the EU likes to keep up the pretence that it has no competence for issues of taxation, it should not therefore interfere at all in the benefits system. To return, finally, to Mr De Rossa’s article, it is noted that Finland and Sweden also contest the listing of two allowances. We respect their stance. The article shows that the Commission has exempted the Irish carers’ allowance, as the Irish Government wished. It is wrong and iniquitous that the United Kingdom carers’ allowance has not been exempted. As regards the three United Kingdom benefits, let me say unequivocally that Her Majesty’s elected government should be treated like its Irish counterparts in that respect and that should be the end of the matter.

 Mr President, Rule 166 states very clearly that you are required to give us a response to complaints such as those already made by my colleagues, Mr Batten and Mr Knapman, concerning violence used against our members of staff by your members of staff. What steps are you taking or proposing to take to hold to account those who have used violence apparently in your name?

 Madam President, I have a few observations. I do not trust the Commission; I do not trust unelected bureaucrats behind the scenes who have meetings for which I do not have any minutes. I do not trust this place, which gives a veneer of democracy, but which is largely made up of placemen. This looks to me like political editorial control over things on the Internet – the new medium. It is the sort of thing we condemn when it happens in China. I do not like it. It smells a bit to me. I do not know what is going on behind the scenes, as the previous speaker just said, and what deals are being done that we do not know about. We have perfectly good copyright laws. We have perfectly good data protection laws. That should be enough. I do not want any more control coming to this sinister and corrupt institution.

 Madam President, I have spent 40 years in financial services, so I think perhaps I know a little bit about what I am talking about here. Let me just say a little about the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA), which will guide us onto the target of how mistakes are made. The FSA in the United Kingdom has a rule book of half a million words. Nobody understands it – least of all the FSA. The FSA interprets its own rule book in secret; they keep the fines that they impose to beef up their own salaries and pensions; there is no court of appeal. I have written to Commissioner McCreevy on this subject and it drives a coach and horses through Articles 6 and 7 of his own Human Rights Act. There is no court of appeal. There is no legal recourse at all if they get it wrong. The general public has been given the impression that if a regulation has an FSA stamp on it it cannot go wrong. There is no concept of caveat emptor
. Now it is going to be, it would appear, subsumed by some sort of EU overseer, consisting no doubt of ignorant bureaucrats, Scandinavian housewives, Bulgarian mafia and Romanian peg-makers. Frankly, I think you are going to get on really well with each other.

– Mr President, I live on a lovely island – a beautiful island – which has been systematically destroyed by the European Union over the last 15 years. I have seen the European Union Landfill Directive, which has had industrial waste – laughingly called ‘compost’ – thrown upon the land. I have seen hundreds of thousands of fish dumped in the North Sea. Near my own village, I have seen what used to be wonderful fields of wheat and barley and dairy cattle being turned over to things like miscanthus and all sorts of other biofuels, wrecking our environment and pushing up the cost of food. The European Union wants us to meet our objectives of renewable energy. Thirty-five thousand wind turbines the size of jumbo jets, the biggest desecration of my beautiful island since the Industrial Revolution. And now you are looking for a remit over one of the last wildernesses in the world, the Arctic. Well, Mr President, colleagues, let me tell you that I agree with Mrs Wallis. Your record is appalling and the answer has got to be, for goodness’ sake, keep your nose out of this.

 – Mr President, it is fascinating as always. No sense of irony again in this Chamber. One of the biggest problems that we have, particularly in the United Kingdom, is the monstrously stupid avalanche of rules and regulations that came to slaughterhouses 10 years ago which managed to close over 1 000 abattoirs in the United Kingdom and gave rise to much longer journey times for animals. My brother-in-law is a butcher. He owns an abattoir in Yorkshire and at one stage – and this got into the Private Eye
 magazine – there was a visiting vet supervising a vet supervising a meat inspector supervising two slaughtermen! That is the sort of nonsense that you get when you are dealing with this organisation’s rules and regulations. The problem is journey times. Now from Bridlington in my constituency, pigs, sheep and cattle are being transported right the way across England to Manchester because of all these closures of slaughterhouses. That is what we need to address. I am also talking about the transportation of horses. My colleague, Nigel Farage, tells me that there are countries in the European Union which actually regard horses as food! As an Englishman, I find it absolutely incredible that people would eat their horses. An Englishman would no more eat his horse than he would his dog or his children, but then I suppose that just shows the enormous cultural divide that there is between us and the other countries of this Union.

 Mr President, well, Commissioner Kallas seems to have read a completely different document. I can assure him that as a UK PLC this simply would not do at all. If any UK PLC had filed accounts of this nature for 14 years which have been completely unacceptable, and again this year – and I do not regard the Court of Auditors as having given this a clean bill of health at all, and I have read the document – if the Commission were a board of UK PLC directors I have to say they would now be in prison! We have a situation here where this Parliament, if Parliament it is, which spends most of the year talking about bendy bananas, knobbly parsnips, standardisation of bottle sizes, and on Tuesday we were even voting on the standardisation of tractor seats, so this absurd organisation spends most of its year doing nothing very much of value. We only have one serious responsibility, and that is to hold the Commission to account on the budget. That is the most serious thing we can do; and it is going to go through again for the 15th year on the nod. It is an utter disgrace, and let the British MEPs know I am watching very carefully how they vote. I will make sure that it is known back in the UK what they do out here as opposed to what they actually say when they go home.

 Mr President, there is sadly a fundamental misunderstanding by most politicians as to the reasons why there are differentials between the genders in pay. The basic premise, erroneous though it is, perpetuates the myth that employment is a demand-led, employer-governed phenomenon. It is no such thing. Those who argue that all women should be paid the same as men for perceived similarities in the job description miss the point entirely that no individual is an economic unit. In spite of already overburdening employment legislation, usually drafted by people with little or no business experience, pay differentials continue for one simple reason: employment is about demand and supply; it is about lifestyle choices; it is often based on priorities, early retirement goals, a desire to live in certain parts of a country or town, pressure of hobbies or sport, or one of those offspring. Employer and employee strike a mutual bargain in the same way as the buyer and seller of any commodity. The UK Equality and Human Rights Commission employs substantially more women than men, and the average pay for their men is higher than for their women. I agree that past legislation has had a limited impact on these dynamics. Yes, you might as well legislate against a ... (The President cut off the speaker.)

 Mr President, there is enormous discrimination against women in the United Kingdom, sadly. I know my own committee – the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality – have their heart in the right place. However, most of the discrimination comes because the employment laws are so onerous for small businesses recruiting young women that they simply discriminate in a covert way. I think it is the classic law of unintended consequence. You make a law here, you make a law there, and what actually happens is that nothing happens, which actually reinforces the position. I do not mean to sound ungallant, but when I look round my committee – the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality – I see that their mindset is deeply locked in the 1970s – they have not moved on. I am afraid that life is not like that any more, and when I hear people talk about the emancipation of women, I am sorry, but as an Englishman, that happened a very long time ago. I do not know what problems other countries have, but please do not lay all this on the United Kingdom, where we do not have the problem, because, although, again, I say your heart is in the right place (the law of unintended consequences), you are making a real bollocks of it.

 Mr President, I rise on Rule 9, specifically Annex I, Article 1. I did try to catch the eye last night in the debate, I am afraid to no avail. There were only three or four people in the Chamber. The rapporteur, Mrs Jackson, has been getting money from a recycling company or a waste-disposal company, which was undeclared, when she was actually rapporteur of this committee. I find this a little fishy, even by the standards of this House, so I do not think she was the right and proper person to be rapporteur for this report.

 Mr President, I love coming here to the regulation factory. It is so amusing. I have just looked through the headings under the Commission’s annual policy strategy and it starts with ‘growth and jobs’. To be honest, this place would be very much better served to talk about growth and jobs if at least more than 1% of this Chamber had had any experience at all of commerce. I am a businessman and I can understand growth and I can understand jobs. Sadly, the more you regulate, the more you legislate, the less likely you are to produce growth and jobs, which is why GDP growth in Europe is positively dire and it is taking off in the rest of the world – China, India, the subcontinent. We are even beaten by North America. So, I would suggest that if we want growth and jobs, we get out of people’s faces and let them get on with it, without interference from this place. Sustainable Europe? Well, fascinating, is it not? We talk about the global footprint, we talk about all this sort of nonsense, despite the fact that the globe has not actually warmed for 10 years – the science is thrown out of the window. If anybody wants to take any serious look at global science and global warming and climate change, they will see that, actually, most informed, not politically-biased, scientists regard it as fact that we will actually have a colder planet by 2050, not a warmer one. But that does not suit our book, does it? Because we like to tax and we like to regulate. Then we look at managed migration. Well, dear, oh dear. As an Englishman, I can tell you: managed migration? We have had a million people come into our tiny little overcrowded island in the last year. Please, please, please, will this place, just for once, get real!

 Madam President, I think I can be forgiven for thinking I had stumbled across a Hollywood Oscar nomination ceremony a little bit earlier on: everybody congratulating each other, slapping each other on the back, absolutely marvellous! Mr Stubb managed to thank just about everybody, but I think he forgot his grandmother. Yes, Mr Stubb, you missed out your grandmother! Well, interesting, is it not? We harmonise, we homogenise, we regulate, we legislate. It is as though this institution somehow has a manic desire to prove its worth by sheer activity: good, bad, indifferent. We must be seen to be busy. The assumption here is that the European citizen is some sort of backward child, and we are the well-meaning but authoritative parents: we know all and we control all. Yet we do not, do we? The level of commercial experience in this Chamber is pitiful. Political placemen, journeymen, with no real understanding of the outside world at all, manically producing flawed and dangerous legislation, while we greedily suck at the public teat with our ludicrous posturing. The emerging countries such as India and China, who take over our manufacturing production even as I speak, must stare in wonder at us. World competition in trade is not unlike a football match. They watch us line up on the field, the whistle blows, and we assiduously start to kick the ball into our own goal. How they must laugh behind our backs. Not that this Chamber has any legitimacy left as the new Constitution is railroaded through, against the will of the people. But their day will come, and it will be into the courtyard for all of us to the rattle of rifle bolts, and we will have richly deserved it.

I can vote with common sense, and I voted against the Baringdorf report because I find the whole idea of the spy in the sky and satellites deeply distasteful and extremely frightening. I think it can only lead to long-term abuse. It is bound to happen – and I know our lady friend down here, who is all motherhood and apple pie, thinks it is absolutely wonderful – but of course we have got to look at the next generation. I am afraid I have a deep distrust of politicians. If they can abuse a power, they always do, and I see this as being absolutely no different, so I voted against.

 Mr President, I wonder if I might perhaps offer a few words of wisdom here. I have spent most of my life in merchant banking, albeit not retail banking, and I have to say I do not regard it as the business of politicians to come between a consumer, or a lender, and a borrower. I would not dream of trying to regulate on this subject, with all my experience. I look down the list of people who actually serve on this committee and in this Parliament and I do not see a great deal of experience there, so it is a question of the blind leading the blind. I think that this place, which has not managed to audit its own books for nearly 11 years, commenting on this is slightly absurd. The fact that you can actually have rules for Bucharest, London and Paris and consumers in those places is absolutely ludicrous. Perhaps I could warn people like the UK Government that bailing out banks to the tune of 50% of their entire reserves is fundamentally wrong. So, if I may, let me give one tip to the consumer: ‘never a lender or a borrower be’, and to governments, let me say: ‘a fool and his money are soon parted’!

 Mr President, yesterday we enjoyed a wonderfully clever speech by the French President. I listened intently to this articulate wee man. He stood foursquare for free trade. But, of course, if other countries were for protectionism, so was he. He stood foursquare for democracy: the people were entitled to have their views heard, but then, it would seem, ignored, as the people of France and Holland have been ignored. He is, as he would have it, a European first, but a Frenchman through and through, a Frenchman first, but a European through and through. Okay, with a bit of Hungarian goulash thrown in. We need a European army, navy and air force to ensure our peaceful European values are spread far and wide, for we must never go to war again. We must build on our democratic institutions but not, it would seem, too much. The French cannot have another referendum, because that might lead to an English referendum, and of course we all know that the British would reject the new Constitution – oh, sorry – ‘Treaty’. We must, he suggested, examine ourselves more closely and make sure there is more motherhood, not just for women but for men; more apple pie, especially for the poor, whether they want it or not.

 Mr President, I would like to address my remarks to the gallery, which is a lot more filled than this Hemicycle is with Members. I hope you have got your headphones on because decisions are being made here today by people with absolutely no knowledge of international finance at all. I have been 40 years in financial services; I am a professional economist – we are talking about hedge funds, we are talking about international currency. If you want to look up the books and see what expertise the Members of the European Parliament have, I think you will be bitterly disappointed. But here we are, making decisions for global finance. Forty percent of British GDP is the City of London. We have people from Poland, the Czech Republic and Latvia who have absolutely no knowledge of these sorts of things whatsoever, deciding where we are going to go for the future in international finance.

 Mr President, Mr Toubon concedes that ‘the citizens of all Member States are having their doubts about the internal market and the other common policies’. He allows that the EU has not succeeded in overcoming a crisis of confidence. Then he refers to the very document – now known as the ‘Reform Treaty’ – which has precipitated this crisis, by saying patronisingly that involving national parliaments will help them better understand the advantages of a single market. These poor benighted parliaments, by the way, are only the democratically elected sovereign legislators of 27 European nations, unlike this absurd consultative assembly which does not and cannot represent anyone but the Commission and its associated elites. With that, this report launches into a plan to undermine national responsibility for universal services by changing the definition of universal services and including health services, to take control of intellectual property rights, which we all know will include patents on software, to adjust business taxation without representation, to set up a sort of King Canute’s throne on an isotherm in order to grab power and money through carbon trading.

 Mr President, nobody comes out of this with any great honour, do they? But of course we are dealing yet again with the abandonment of the concept of caveat emptor
. As a financial economist, I knew that Equitable Life was unsound in the middle of the 1990s, but it marketed its plans direct to the public with the sales line ‘there are no middle men’. Well, the middle men were the professionals, but the something-for-nothing culture came to the fore yet again. What about the elephant in the room, the National Provident Institution? Same sort of problem, but they did not have the same number of lawyers and politicians who made up their client bank. So are we talking about a common regulatory policy like the common agricultural policy, or the common fisheries policy? Why do they not adopt our audit and accounting systems here? God help us! Taxpayers’ money for failed investment? This is a very slippery slope, ladies and gentlemen. Marconi shares? Institutional pension funds? Where does it end? Sometimes investments go wrong, and that’s life. It is sad, but we have to put up with it.

 Mr President, I would like in the very short time allocated to me to make one or two observations, offering perhaps some words of caution. In the last couple of years I have seen that there is something of an addiction to gesture politics here, which is something we must be extremely careful to avoid in our relationships with the United States of America. The impact of legislation, for example, is completely global. Everything we do has a global dimension. The serious GDP growth is in the Pacific rim, India and China, notwithstanding other parts of the Pacific and Japan, so we must be extremely careful not to burn any bridges when dealing with the United States, which also has a very serious protectionist element in its society. As the British know, the United States is the UK’s biggest trading and investment partner and has been for some years. It is a shame that the British have been forced, against their will, to abandon the imperial measure, which of course we share with the United States of America, and which gave us a particular advantage there. However, that is something that must wait for another day.

 Madam President, I find this absolutely fascinating! Every time I come here I have to smile. What this place knows about running small businesses is absolutely unbelievable. When I look up the CVs of Members of this Parliament, I find that nobody has ever had any serious responsibility for a small company in their lives. It is amazing what we all know about these things! In 1992 I started a small business. I thought about it and I bought some old-fashioned, second-hand furniture. I sucked my pencil and thought, ‘My goodness me, what have I done? I have left a big corporation, where do I go from here?’. That business now has branches in Hong Kong, Jersey, the Channel Islands and South Africa, as well as London and York, which is my constituency. I really do not think I could do that again. There are so many
 regulations, it is unbelievable. If you really want to fire up small business in the European Union, and particularly the United Kingdom, I would suggest that these people here and the Commission get their blasted noses out of everybody else’s business and stop trying to tell us how we should run our businesses! Just let us get on with it, because if you do not, more and more businesses are going to go to Dubai, Bermuda and the Channel Islands – I am moving half my business to the Channel Islands as it is. I would counsel you and the Commission to please keep your ill-informed noses out of small businesses!

 Mr President, well, we are at it again. In my view, Mr Sacconi is not so much building a mountain as digging himself an enormous hole. May I say at this festive time that I hope he mixes his martinis as enthusiastically as he mixes his metaphors. Whatever he says, we are talking of the regulation of over 30 000 substances, policed by another army of self-important inspectors who already suck at the teat of the overtaxed and over-regulated taxpayer. The extent of the regulation is bound to take the focus off relatively few instances where serious action is needed. Yet again, we British see in this directive the advancement of the abandonment of the presumption of innocence, with no redress for damages for British businesses, not to mention the horrific experimentation on millions of animals, whatever you may try and persuade yourself. I certainly beg my British federalist colleagues, all of whom support this misguided legislation, for once to get up off their bellies and strike a blow for our own national civil law and against the sovietism of this place. We all know the effect of Russian sovietism on Russia’s own and the global environment.

 Madam President, just for a moment I should like to test our wonderful interpreters. ‘European Union entrepreneurship’ is an oxymoron, is it not? The whole raison d’être
 – if I may lapse into the vernacular of this place – is to stifle small business. Rule upon rule, regulation upon regulation are generally made by people with no commercial experience at all. I went through the list of over 700 MEPs just yesterday, and I could not find more than about 5 people who had bona fide business experience. The Commissioners go on the Microsoft yacht for their holidays, the British Prime Minister has close relations with Lord Browne of BP, and so on and so forth, but that has nothing whatsoever to do with business. Business in Western Europe is millions upon millions of small businessmen and women living a life of quiet desperation, trying to put their livelihoods together. Small businesses account for over 52% of the UK’s GDP. You tell us in this place what age we may recruit at; you tell us what colour they may be; you tell us how much leave they must have; you tell us how much their pensions will be. It goes on and on. If we really wanted to get this place sorted out and we really wanted entrepreneurship, I would suggest that we only have Commissioners and MEPs who have actually done an honest day’s work in their lives. There are none! (Applause from the public gallery)

 Mr President, it is rather difficult for me to know where to begin on this. Energy is the lifeblood of any nation state and, of course, I am sent here to represent a nation state. I think it is very difficult for the people of the United Kingdom to accept that their energy policy should be decided basically by foreigners. It is within living memory that we have had to fight the battle of the Atlantic and we have had to live on a knife-edge for freedom because continental countries seem to find it impossible to live together. The thought, the idea or the concept that United Kingdom energy could possibly be controlled by some sort of arrangement with a gangster like Putin is absolutely ludicrous! It is absolute madness to expect anything from a piece of paper signed by Putin, any more than we would from one signed by Adolf Hitler. The man is a gangster. If you are expecting the people of the United Kingdom to make any sort of arrangement for their lifeblood, the very lifeblood of the nation state, and to base it on people who have no fundamental interest in the wellbeing of the United Kingdom, I can tell you that it will not happen. We also have to start speaking the truth. There seems to be some sort of abstract concept here of renewable energy. It is a scientific fact that most of our renewable energy technology does not work. Wind farms are absurd. Any scientist independently retained will tell you that it is complete and total nonsense to expect the United Kingdom to produce the sort of energy levels that the European Union seems to require – which is 20% from a renewable source – by means of wind farms. We have to start telling people the truth. We do not yet have the technology for renewable energy. Let us be honest about it, but then honesty, of course, is something that we avoid in this Chamber!

 Mr President, one of the many gifts the British Empire gave to the world was the global abolition of slavery. It has come to my notice, via my constituents in Yorkshire, that the practice continues in Cyprus, the people of which country never cease to lecture us on the foibles of the Turks when it comes to human rights. It is called indentured labour. Philippine and Singhalese female domestic staff are treated appallingly: their passports are basically confiscated by their employers. I have given full details of the matter in a parliamentary question. Indentured labour by any other term is a form of slavery. It exists in the European Union and it is disgraceful. Let us please hear less humbug from the Cypriot representatives and let us see them put their own house in order. Enough of this indentured labour! It is a disgrace!

 Mr President, I am very worried indeed about this report: it introduces the concept of positive discrimination. I have to say, as usual, that I have never heard so much nonsense talked in my life as I have today. Clearly, nobody here has any experience of the armed forces. I spent a lot of time in the British Army and I am a member of the United Kingdom’s Armed Forces Committee. I can tell you that I have been at sea recently on board Her Majesty’s ships with women who are navigation officers, aviators, filling all sorts of very
 complex and senior roles within the British armed forces. How would you feel if you were the captain of a ship and you have a navigating officer joining you who is a lieutenant commander and a female? Could you trust her or not? Is she there because she is good at her job, or is she there because she is part of a quota? Let us stop this silly nonsense from people with no experience of the armed forces at all!

 Mr President, I wish to raise a point under Rule 151(3) of the Rules of Procedure. I wonder whether you can help me. Should you declare Amendments 8 and 16 of this Doorn report inadmissible, since the Treaty of Nice is the only treaty that is in force? There is no such thing as the ‘Constitutional Treaty’. Although there are many here who wish to forget that, the French and Dutch voted ‘no’ in their referendums. No treaty has replaced the Treaty of Nice. These amendments should therefore be declared inadmissible. (Applause from the IND/DEM Group)

 Mr President, I wonder if Parliament and the Commission would be so keen to applaud the Competition Commissioner Mrs Kroes if they knew that for some 13 years she was a member of Ballast Nedam’s welfare council, which was set up to protect employee welfare. She would therefore have been aware of the situation that would result when Ballast Nedam, owned by a Dutch construction company, unceremoniously pulled the plug on the UK subsidiary, leaving some 2000 employees with a grossly under-funded pension fund. Many in my constituency are now almost destitute. If this is the type of behaviour which results in people being awarded positions in the Commission, it is little wonder that Europe is doing so fantastically badly in everything it turns its hand to.

 People trafficking, or slavery as we used to call it, stamped out by the British Empire with the force of the Royal Navy behind it, is now a sad fact of life under the new Brussels Empire. This despicable trade is being unwittingly fostered by a policy agenda governed by man-hating lesbians with no knowledge or understanding of the real world.

 Mr President, I speak as a professional economist of some years – not without a modest prestige in the City of London – so perhaps I know something of how the global economy works. The idea that failing national economies should be given money to protect them from global realities is like giving a bottle of whisky to an alcoholic. One man’s State aid is another man’s tax. Money spent by a politician is nearly always wasted. This place is the problem, it is not the solution. Perhaps we should occupy our time with a standardisation of windscreen wipers or spirit bottles, or phasing out the oldest profession in the world, or some such nonsense. Let us see if serious thought should be left to those with experience of the real world, sadly unrepresented in this place.

We are strongly against the trafficking of all people and slavery, but we do not feel that it is the competence of the EU to interfere in domestic issues, and in particular we do not feel that the EU should be creating a policy regarding prostitution. All the items mentioned in the report have already been covered by UK legislation, and it is these laws which should be utilised fully rather than to create yet more EU legislation, which would have resulted in negative consequences.

 Madam President, this evening I have heard the words ‘trafficking’, ‘slavery’, ‘violence’, ‘abuse’, ‘organised crime’, ‘paedophilia’, ‘rape’ - all of them scourges of modern society, as we all agree. However, I do not know of any national governments that have not already made these illegal. I cannot for the life of me see the point in reinventing the wheel when all this is already illegal across the European Union. What we need to do is get on with our business and start enforcing the laws that we already have. I am also surprised that you are surprised that this is the sort of thing that happens when you tear down all the border controls. It is difficult to believe that it has actually taken anybody by surprise at all. It was surely inevitable. As to the criminalisation of the client, which somebody suggested earlier, in the United Kingdom homosexuality was made legal in order to do away with what was then known as a ‘blackmailer’s charter’. If you start to criminalise the client in these matters, you will find that the law of unintended consequence comes into play, something at which I am afraid this Parliament is all too adept.

 Mr President, buried deep in the committee opinions attached to the Sacconi report we find a slim contribution from the Committee on Budgets showing funding forecasts for the proposed European Chemicals Agency. Those forecasts appear as an admirably clear table covering the years 2006 to 2016 and allowing for EUR 78 million of taxpayers’ money over this period to support the Agency. Curiously, this amount is spread very unevenly over the ten years in question with most of it, more than EUR 50 million, concentrated in 2014 and 2015. Even curiouser, no one on the Budgets Committee, including the chairman, seems to know anything about these figures, even though they appear in the Budgets Committee’s opinion. Why is this? And why is the Agency expected to use two-thirds of its ten-year budget in only two years of the next decade?

 Mr President, most of us agree that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality does yeoman work – well, at least in my view, as much as other committee. While I recognise the basic direction behind this report and the difficulties some women face on remuneration, and I wholeheartedly support the need for better statistical information on this particular topic, I have to draw the House’s attention to the double standards that we employ. Today you can buy this magazine in the Parliament’s shop: it is hardcore pornography. Although an American publication, it depicts eastern European models, I suspect because of the poverty referred to by Mrs Záborská’s team. It is the tip of the iceberg of exploitation and people trafficking, subjects highlighted by this very report. Yet it is for sale here. I find the hypocrisy of the European Parliament on this subject, like so many, many others, sadly predictable.

 Mr President, I should just like to make an observation about the law of unintended consequences. A lot of the legislation that we adopt in this place does not actually work in the way that it should. A recent example in the United Kingdom involved a female pilot, Mrs Starmer, who has one child and, I think, has another on the way. She took British Airways to an industrial tribunal because it did not allow her to have part– 
time flying responsibility. British Airways suggested that she did not have enough hours or experience to take on that role. I think – and I have never heard anybody suggest otherwise – that British airmanship is the best in the world, even the Americans concede that. British Airways, as I think you will agree, is a benchmark across the globe for high standards of airmanship. Mrs Starmer won at a tribunal on the basis of legislation, and nobody knows when they get on a plane whether the pilot is actually competent to fly that aeroplane, or somebody who is a young mum just having fun. I think that is a great shame.

 Mr President, this parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control has attempted not only to brush under the carpet serious allegations of financial discrepancies at the Committee of the Regions, but also to wash its hands, like Pontius Pilate, over yet another whistleblower left to face appalling and unjust treatment for being brave enough to tell the truth. It beggars belief that Mr Stubb could have drawn up any report, let alone one of such a sensitive nature, without making sure he interviewed all the key players. Yet it seems he could not, or would not, see the Committee of the Regions’ former Internal Auditor. On the back of this shocking disregard, it is little surprise that Mr Stubb’s report contains so many howlers. The original draft claimed that the then Internal Auditor had not been subject to an internal inquiry, when the Committee of the Regions’ Secretary-General had admitted in writing that he had been. Mr Stubb claims that: ‘... none of the officials who were the subject of the administrative inquiry has been promoted since the completion of the report’. However, he omits to mention that several of them were allegedly put forward for promotion. Most nauseatingly, the report states that the former Internal Auditor was assured that he had ‘the full support and cooperation of both CoR members and staff’. That man has since been locked out of his office and hounded out of his job for telling the truth. Mr Stubb’s report is rotten to the core, just like the EU institutions it represents.

I would particularly like to say that it is my first visit here and it is disgraceful that something so undemocratic can take place: somebody has misquoted from the press with no prior engagement with me and no prior notice.

 Mr President, the whole climate change programme has given the EU yet another excuse to flex its muscles and show the world how important it is, claiming that this is an issue that nation states cannot deal with alone. The 20 20 20 slogan is a typical example of a catchy phrase to work with: 20% of energy in the EU from renewable sources; a 20% reduction in carbon emissions – all by the year 2020. But you are missing the most important point: is any of this necessary? We were told recently by the IPCC that 2 500 scientists were all in agreement that CO2
 was responsible for global warming and that we humans were the culprits. Al Gore’s infamous film confirmed that view. Since then, however, over 30 500 scientists and climatologists have signed the Oregon Petition and the Manhattan Declaration which directly challenges the IPCC conclusions with some very compelling evidence. So whilst we are urged to believe the IPCC’s 2 500 scientists, we are being told to completely ignore the 30 500 scientists who are painting a different picture. The EU is persuading nations across the world to spend billions of taxpayers’ money, at the very time when the world is facing dire financial problems, on something that might not only be totally unnecessary, but could well prove to be counter-productive if the latest evidence of global cooling proves to be correct. We must have a full and open debate to prove exactly who is right. What do supporters of the IPCC’s position have to fear? You will no doubt be pleased to hear that this will be my very last speech in this Parliament since I retire after this session.

 Madam President, with the REACH Regulation now beginning to take its terrible toll on productive industry, especially on smaller businesses, and the numbers of animal experiments rising sharply, here in the form of A6-0140/2008
 come some more instructions from the world-government zealots of UNESCO on how to classify, label and package the results of its previous idea. Being equally thirsty for anti-democratic global domination, the commercial and political elite which constitutes the European Union hastens to implement these instructions, just as they did to implement REACH. They made a barrage of assurances of their good intentions which may for the moment protect or delude their so-called stakeholders, but which will not satisfy the great number of the unemployed which these measures are already beginning to produce. A crumb of recognition for public opinion falls from the master’s table in the form of Amendments 10, 12, 39 and 42, to place reducing animal experimentation in certain circumstances before adherence to the letter of the legislation. I understand that this is due to pressure from the influential environmental groups upon which the EU depends for so much of its support, and placing the welfare of non-human primates above that of humans, as expressed in Amendment 40, is surely going too far to placate them, but finding anything deserving of a positive vote in the oppressive and obsessive process of EU legislation is a rarity worthy of note. For the rest, there is no reason why sensible standards of safety should not be adopted voluntarily by democratic nation states with independent judiciaries and free public access to judicial systems. Supranational edicts may appear to be an easy option, but the centralised unaccountable power they contribute, directive by unmandated directive, is not just their sting in the tail but their principal awful effect. The claim put forward in recital 7 to the effect that this legislation will provide a competitive advantage to industry and, as Amendment 1 adds, in particular to small and medium-sized enterprises, is simply ludicrous. As always, the EU’s big business overlords will benefit from the failure of their smaller competitors. They will become even larger fish in a smaller pond or flee abroad, and far from kowtowing to the EU and its ridiculous restrictions, traders overseas will trade much more profitably with each other than they will with us. The boom is over. The recession has begun and under the burden of EU regulation such as A6-0140/2008
, our economies are sinking like stones. Each traveller on this gravy train can tell his electorate whatever he likes in their own language without fear that they will overhear what his colleagues in other states are telling their electors. There is no general EU electorate and there cannot be one until perhaps in a century or two everyone speaks one language, and until that time comes EU democracy will be a joke, and a dark and dangerous joke at that. But your privileges are enormous. Why should you care about this or the crazy counterproductive laws you continually rubber stamp? And why should I care, because I am retiring at the end of this month? When I read Amendment 28 it made me realise why I have had enough of all this nonsense. It says: ‘Preparation means a mixture or solution composed of two or more substances. Mixture and preparation are synonyms’. Well, however would we survive without this supernanny state explaining such things to us, and how on earth have I survived to the ripe old age of 68 when I spent my infant years chewing the leaded paint off the wooden frame of my cot? I suppose it gave my antibodies something to do in the days when we actually had antibodies. Each leaden edict brings the collapse of the EU closer. I rejoice in that, but I deplore the damage which you are inflicting on 27 former democracies, year by disastrous year.

 Madam President, I have been asked to speak today on Euromed. This is the insane attempt to create a pan-Mediterranean bloc, joining Europe with north Africa. To the architects of this scheme, it was a brilliant idea: Europe would transfer wealth and technology to north Africa and north Africa would transfer cheap labour and oil and gas to Europe. In reality, it is a disastrous idea. We have already seen what happens when you allow people from poor countries to have freedom of movement into richer ones. Can you imagine how much more true this will be if north Africa gets this right too? At a time of heightened international terrorism, is it a good idea to have freedom of movement from countries with known al-Qa’ida presences? After the terrorist atrocities in Madrid and London, one would have thought Europe would have learned its lessons. Clearly not! Let us also talk about oil and gas. The north African countries know Europe can be bullied. Is it really a good idea to put our energy security in the hands of the military dictatorship in Algeria or Colonel Gadaffi in Libya, both of whom are aware of our vulnerability? I strongly urge the EU to cease this scheme. We have already had one imperial mare nostrum
. We do not need another.

We generally vote against EU legislation and indeed voted against this report as a whole. However, we felt that there were a number of amendments we could vote for. We voted yes to Amendments 10 and 12, as they reject the militarisation of the EU. We too oppose the militarisation of the EU. These amendments did not call on the Commission to act, nor did they acknowledge the authority of the Commission or EU. They were simple statements that happened to agree with us on this particular question. Therefore, we could vote for these two amendments without compromising our overall stance to both this report as a whole and EU legislation in general.

 Mr President, I agree with Mr Pęk. Many eminent scientists from around the world signed the Manhattan Declaration on 4 March this year. Amongst other things, it states that ‘there is no convincing evidence that CO2
 emissions from modern industrial activity has in the past, is now, or will in the future, cause catastrophic climate change’. Last week, another 31 000 scientists endorsed that view in the Oregon Petition. This is no longer the odd dissenting voice, and Nigel Lawson, a member of the House of Lords Committee on Climate Change, also agrees that the debate is not over. Before we commit ourselves to enormous costs by way of climate taxes, carbon trading etc. at the very time when we are being warned of a likely global economic recession, we must listen to both sides of the debate and make absolutely sure who is right.

 Mr President, the EU has decided that we can now grow fuel and is telling countries in the developing world that, instead of growing food, they should grow fuel so that the EU can continue to run its limousines. Since I became an MEP, it is hard to remember any issue which has provoked such a deluge of letters as the subject of biofuels. I have received over a hundred requests to vote against the Commission’s renewable energy target. I have not needed much persuading because as a UKIP MEP I vote against any imposition of EU targets on my country anyway. However, on this occasion, I am happy to vote against it because the dash to biofuels, an essential part of the Commission’s strategy, is a key factor in the surge in food prices around the world. British Government adviser Professor John Beddington has said that there are real problems with the unsustainability of biofuels. He is right. We have become so obsessed with global warming that we have overlooked the real elephant in the room – the global food crisis. For farmers in places like Africa there is now less land available for growing food because many people are growing fuel instead. It is also leading to the destruction of rainforests with devastating effects. So less land for food equals less food but an increase in the supply of people, which inevitably means an increase in food prices. Across the world, and in Europe in particular, food prices have been rising far more quickly than inflation. The EU prides itself on taking the lead in environmental matters. Will it therefore take the lead in recognising that biofuels are not the answer? Biofuels are pushing up prices in shopping baskets around the world. We in the West will groan, grin and bear it; in the developing world, it is a matter of life or death. The EU has never been a friend to the developing world. Giant factory ships have emptied the west African seas of fish. Dumping of subsidised agricultural surplus has devastated the profit margins of many of their farmers and now, while their populations are increasing, their land, rather than providing food for their own people, is being used to keep our cars on the road. Already there have been violent food riots across the world as desperate hungry people attack grain silos and supermarkets. In some countries troops are on the streets to protect what is left of the food. The risk of armed conflict between and within states is greatly increased by the EU’s policies – so much for the EU keeping the peace. What is more useful to a villager in Africa? A full petrol tank or a full stomach? Please listen to common sense and reverse your policy on biofuels immediately.

 Mr President, the EU is proud of its commitment to the IPCC’s recommendations on how to combat global warming by persuading its Member States to inject massive funding into carbon-emission control projects. But have you backed the wrong horse? Last month many eminent scientists and climatologists from around the world met in New York and after two days of serious discussions issued the Manhattan Declaration, which states categorically that there is no convincing evidence that CO2
 emissions from modern industrial activity have in the past, are now, or will in the future cause catastrophic climate change; and that adaptation, as needed, is massively more cost-effective than any attempted mitigation. They recommend that world leaders reject the views expressed by the United Nations IPCC, as well as popular but misguided works such as An Inconvenient Truth
, and that all taxes, regulations and other interventions intended to reduce emissions of CO2
 be abandoned forthwith. Finally, Lord Lawson, who is a member of the House of Lords Select Committee on Climate Change, says this: ‘The average temperature in Helsinki is less than 5°C. In Singapore it is in excess of 27°C – a difference of 22°. If humans can successfully cope with that, it is not immediately apparent why they should not be able to adapt to a change of some 3° when they are given 100 years in which to do so.’ I recommend that you take advice given in the Manhattan Declaration.

 Graham Booth (IND/DEM

 Madam President, nowadays, when the subject of climate change crops up, it is usually described as ‘global warming’. Is this deliberate? The only solution being put forward is to cut greenhouse gas emissions – that is, carbon dioxide – dramatically, because it is claimed that a 30% reduction will reduce the average temperature of the earth by 2° by 2020. Such an assertion is quite amazing when no reference to the effect the sun will have had over that period is taken into account, but, for the sake of this exercise, let us suppose that the so-called ‘taxpayer-funded experts’ are right. Climate change is precisely that: climate changes all the time. So, what if earth’s climate decides to cool down instead of warm up? Will it then be suggested that we must produce much more carbon dioxide to try and offset the cooling? Of course not. They are so committed to their present ‘global warming’ prediction, that that would not be an option, but, sadly, it looks as if that is what is happening. For the last nine years since 1998, global temperature on earth has remained the same. For the past decade the world has not warmed. Global warming has stopped. That is not a viewpoint or a sceptic’s inaccuracy, it is an observational fact. It is also a scientific fact that far more people die from being too cold than from being too warm. So, to sum up, if global warming has been just a temporary blip, and we are now heading relentlessly for the next ice age, any reductions in CO2 emissions will have precisely the opposite asserted effect to that which is intended. In the billions of years of earth’s existence, a very brief pause to check the facts is surely not too much to ask.

 Madam President, I should like to explain why I voted against the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. The CAP has done nothing but ruin our farming industry in the UK for well over 30 years; we do not want interference from the EU; this will extend their interference yet again. So the reason for voting against it is that we would like to get the powers of running our own agriculture back to Britain. However, there is very little chance of that while we ignore the votes of the people in France and Holland in the referendum that we should be given on the Constitution.

 Madam President, I have a confession to make. I have absolutely no qualifications whatsoever for this job and yet I find myself sitting here helping to make legislation that affects around 400 million people. When I look around the full Chamber, I fear that very many of the Members share my lack of qualifications, looking at the level of debate we seem to get here. The people, the citizens of the Member States, have an enormous amount of intelligence collectively, yet we deny them the right to make their own decisions. In my view, this is in an area that politicians should keep well out of and give the people their own decisions; in particular, please let them have a referendum on the EU Constitution.
 Graham Booth (IND/DEM

 Madam President, yes, I voted against this report. My explanation is that the UK Independence Party supports the return of the grants system for the UK, and I would like to point out that it is our membership of the EU that caused it to be abolished in England and Wales in the first place. However, it is up to Member States, and not the EU, to decide on tax incentives and cuts for employers who cooperate with adult learning. As with most things, we need less interference from the EU, not more. As I see that I am very well within my time, may I add that the coming ratification of the European Constitution, despite its rejection in two referendums, is undemocratic, cowardly and illegitimate.

 Mr President, pursuant to Rule 145, I would just like to make a personal statement. Yes, I have written to the President of Parliament complaining about the voting, as you know. I have updated him several times since then, because my request for full electronic voting was turned down by the committee. Its response was ‘no follow-up’. I have, in fact, written several times. The worst case that I have reported was overturned from ‘rejected’ to ‘approved’ by 567 votes to 17, with 18 abstentions. That is why I have called this system ludicrous in the past. It really must be dealt with.

 Mr President, it is a pleasure to see the Prime Minister here in Brussels. He is an exemplar to other European heads of government, as a man who allowed his own people to decide whether they wished to have the Constitution. For that he must be applauded. In the event, the people of Spain voted overwhelmingly to support the plans. What I would like to know is why he has no intention of repeating the exercise. After all, he should be confident that he will get a similar result. Is it because, as the Prime Minister has said, the Reform Treaty has not let a single substantial point of the Constitutional Treaty go? If so, it would stand to reason that he feels there is no need to ask his people the same question twice. Or, is it the case, as presented to the British people, that the Reform Treaty is so different as to be an entirely separate thing altogether and too complicated for the people to understand? This, of course, is key to all our futures. Either the political elite do not care what people want, as in the case of Mr Sarkozy and Mr Brown, or they feel that the people are too stupid to make any decision more important than what burger to buy at McDonalds. It seems to me that the European Union is rapidly becoming the world’s first post-democratic state. I can tell the Prime Minister this: if the European elite do not allow the people to speak, then, in the end, they will find other ways to make their voices heard.

 Madam President, Al Gore claims that the debate on global warming is over and that it has been proved beyond doubt that human activity is responsible for this. I suggested recently in committee that the sun’s enormous influence on the earth’s climate over millions of years could not be ignored in this debate, and that the sequence of long ice ages, interspersed with short interglacial periods, was the most likely explanation. I received a very hostile reception. However, the chairman, Mr Markov, insisted that it was not appropriate to urge excision of a view that happened to conflict with current orthodoxy. Let us remember that, when Galileo declared in the 17th century that the earth revolved around the sun, he was threatened with torture by the Catholic Church for daring to contradict the accepted fact that the earth was at the centre of the universe. It took the church until 1992 to agree that Galileo had been right. The only CO2
 at issue in the global warming debate is the trivial amount produced by burning fossil fuels. That comparatively small amount is the only modern and unusual addition to the vast quantities constantly being produced by all living things and all decaying organic matter, and through volcanic activity. Before we risk ruining the world’s economies with carbon emission taxes and the like, please let us reopen the debate and make absolutely sure who is right.

Keeping a record of all debates and making them available to the public could help Euro-scepticism. However this will also allow the EU to boast of greater transparency when in fact it will in reality do little to enhance democracy, because the European Parliament cannot initiate legislation and can be ignored by the European Commission. In the EU the unelected Commission initiate EU legislation and they offer no transparency at all. The opportunity for a week to make corrections to speeches (amendment 4) was well intended and would protect MEPs from errors, but up to date news on the EU could potentially be buried by a week’s delay, hindering the free press in informing the public.

Although UKIP makes the point on principle to support any repeal of EU legislation, this is a national security issue and as such the party could not support a measure that could place air passengers and crew at risk. As HMG has expressed, terrorism remains a serious and continuing threat. HMG's view: HMG welcomes the TRAN Committee resolution's acknowledgement that Europe needs a high level of security in aviation. Terrorism remains a serious and continuing threat. It is currently impractical to test more than a small proportion of the liquids that passengers wish to carry. So the interim controls, pending work on a more convenient technology-based solution, represent the only present way of properly ensuring passenger safety.

 Madam President, I believe in free trade. It has benefited my country and is an important tool in helping the world’s poorest nations escape from poverty. However, the EPAs do more harm than good to the cause of free trade because of the hypocrisy of the European Union. On the face of it, opening up our markets to imports from these countries sounds very good as it will help boost their economies, but, as always, there is a flip side to the coin. The developing countries have to open up their markets to goods from Europe, to drop their import tariffs – according to the EU’s timescale by the end of the year – and, if they will not, up will go European trade barriers and down will come the amount of European aid. You cannot run before you can walk. As the rapporteur notes, the facilities are not yet in place in many ACP countries for revenue collection to replace tariffs as a principal source of government funding. In trying to force the pace, I believe we are doing more harm than good to the cause of global free trade. Furthermore, who do we think we are to be bullying these nations into scrapping tariffs? After all, only last year the Commission brought in tariffs on shoes from China. But that was not free trade, or fair for that matter. We were told that they were dumping subsidised products on us. But what are we doing with our surplus agricultural products, subsidised by the CAP? Exactly the same thing: we are dumping them on poor countries and, in the process, dragging their farmers into poverty. The rapporteur says that EPAs are going to be concluded between the EU and many ACP countries. This may well be true, but only because the EU holds the whip hand. ‘Partnership’ it may be called, but it is a most unequal partnership. It suits big business but it does not suit the developing countries. The health and environment standards in Europe are so high that the potential for many ACP countries to export their agricultural produce will be very limited. What is more, the Commission’s own impact assessment suggests that signing these deals could well precipitate the collapse of manufacturing in West Africa. As a citizen of a country that has historically espoused and promoted genuine free trade, I do not want to be complicit in this. It only adds to my determination that my country will negotiate its own trading arrangements and leave this appalling European Union, which, for all its pious talk of relieving poverty and encouraging development, has actually been directly responsible for causing poverty on a massive scale throughout the developing countries of the world.

 Mr President, I think that ‘Mind your own business!’ is the best reaction I can give to this resolution. Housing and regional policy within the Member States is a matter for democratically elected national governments, and it is not for the European Commission to poke its nose into. As well as using much pseudo-intellectual mumbo jumbo, the text also manages to be incredibly patronising when it makes statements of the blindingly obvious such as ‘stresses the importance of safety issues’. This is like a doctor lecturing his patient on the importance of continuing to breathe. The British Government says we must build half a million houses, mostly for first-time buyers and lower-paid purchasers. I may not agree with this entirely, but I would sooner accept this idea as closer to our needs than the wishy-washy ideas that this EU report has come up with. Despite its frequent use of the wonder word ‘subsidiarity’, this resolution is a recipe for housing policy micromanagement from Brussels and more gross interference in the way the Member States are governed. We in Britain do not need Brussels to tell us what sort of houses we need, or when and where to build them.

 Madam President, the UK is one of the few countries that have signed the Athens Protocol, and it therefore has no need for the EU to do this on its behalf. More importantly, the UK’s consent explicitly protected small domestic and inland boats from the onerous compliance costs. Brussels, however, is not satisfied with this and wishes Europe to re-sign. This time it will include those craft least able to afford the regulations. Moreover, its contention that domestic and inland waterways are essentially the same as international travel may indeed reflect the situation in most of continental Europe, but it does not reflect the reality in the UK. To us, going abroad actually means that: we have to cross water. It is what being an island means. Mr Costa himself admits that this extension will create an unnecessary burden for operators in this sector. The British Government calls this problematic, but it is simply telling these small businesses, ‘It is bad, but tough luck. We are going to do it anyway!’ It is obvious to me that this report has had no serious impact assessment. When my office contacted the British Government about whether the regulation would affect cable and chain ferries, such as the Sandbanks Ferry near Poole in my constituency, the answer came back with the casual phrase ‘as far as we know’. Well, they should know! The British Government and this regulation are at odds. One says that it covers seagoing craft, the other that it covers inland waterways. This Assembly must remember that these are real businesses, real jobs, real people and real families, which could be blighted with all this ill-thought-out and proscriptive legislation. That is simply not good enough. In terms of the security and peace of mind of those who work in this sector, this shows contempt for their interests. Overall, it is apparent that this report is an excessively large hammer that will not just crack the nut but could completely destroy it.

 Madam President, the debate we are having about this oral question epitomises so much of what is wrong with the European Union. Firstly, we have to deal with the WTO through one man who represents no less than 27 nations. He has no popular mandate and in the light of his record in British politics would not have been chosen to run a village fête. I do not want an EU representative to speak for my country at the WTO. I want a representative of Her Majesty’s Government who not only knows my country but cares for it too. Then there is the whole issue of competitive tendering. China was mentioned as a potential provider in the oral question and it may well be highly competitive. Whilst I condemn the suppression of individual freedoms and rights in China, the Chinese know a few things about running a successful economy. Government spending is only some 20% of GDP, whereas in the eurozone it was 47.5% in 2005. In China, business runs with a light regulatory touch. In the European Union, we are regulating ourselves to death. In 2005 Mr Blair promised that the British Presidency would cut red tape. It did nothing of the sort. How many thousands of pages did it add to the mountain of legislation? My country was hoodwinked into joining the European Union in 1973 on the basis of it being just a free trade area. This is all it should be: no Parliament, no Commission, no directives. Instead it has become a bureaucratic monster which is wrecking our economy.

 Mr President, the last time I saw a printed copy of the budget for the Structural and Cohesion Funds for the period 2007-2013 it stood at EUR 336 billion, with a precise allocation budgeted for each of the 25 Member States plus the next two in the queue, Bulgaria and Romania. Looking at it from Britain’s point of view, it did not make good reading, so I put the following question to the Committee on Regional Development. I have carefully studied the budget for 2007-2013, totalling EUR 336 billion, which I call Plan A, and I see that EUR 139 billion of the total is being allocated to eight of the latest new Members and another EUR 22 billion to Bulgaria and Romania, with a meagre EUR 12 billion allocated to Britain during that period. If Britain should decide to withdraw from the EU and thus cancel its contribution, do you have a Plan B? There was of course a deathly hush, but such a situation is far from impossible. When the British public finally realises where all its money is going and when the Health Service in particular is so short of funding, a public call for withdrawal is quite likely.

 Mr President, the Solidarity Fund was introduced after devastating floods in the summer of 2002. An attempt is now being made to include terrorist attacks in the list of supposedly natural disasters covered by the fund. As usual, there is an ulterior motive at work here: it appears that disaster relief is to be politicised. Mr Berend suggests in his report, in the context of terrorist attacks, that the EU should be able to use the fund in such cases as a political signal of solidarity. Pandemics are also included, presumably to make the proposal acceptable to a public that is worried about things such as bird flu. It is all a long way from the original intention of the fund. Who, therefore, decides what qualifies for it? Even Mr Berend says that it is incomprehensible that the Commission can make an arbitrary political assessment, thus calling into question the credentials of the institution that has produced this proposal. Once again, we see the confusion and incompetence of the EU in practice. Communities that have suffered disasters – natural or manmade – have their national governments to step in and assist. Even more likely to come to their aid, in cases of extreme disasters such as the tsunami, is the incredible generosity of the general public. The last thing they need is for that perpetual disaster – the EU – to turn up and make things worse!

 Mr President, I wish to focus on the concept of direct state aid as a tool of regional development, to which Mr Hutchinson alludes in his report. It is a concept very closely allied to the idea of structural funds and regional cohesion and my country, the United Kingdom, is paying a heavy price within the EU as a result. The rapporteur called for companies that have received public aid and have then relocated within the EU to be blocked from receiving state aid or structural funding for seven years. But what of respected companies that have applied quite properly for state aid, received no answer from the British Government due to delays from the Commission in giving the green light, and have then relocated to another part of the EU, which fits in better with Brussels’ idea of cohesion and is, therefore, completely free of the same obstructions? In 2002 Peugeot asked the European Commission to approve a state aid package to build the new 207 model at Ryton in the English West Midlands. More than two years later, with still no answer forthcoming from the Commission, Peugeot gave up and announced that the 207 would be built in France and Slovakia. No doubt Brussels saw that as an economic mission accomplished. Meanwhile, Ryton faces an uncertain future. Once production ceases on the 206 model – built there so well and so competitively up until now – if this factory then closes after many years of production under various owners, I suppose one could describe that as a kind of relocation; but it is hardly Peugeot’s fault. Perhaps instead the Commission should be banned for seven years from pronouncing on state aid and from over-regulating the business sector. That would certainly be cheered in the English West Midlands, where skilled workers are suffering at the hands of EU economic policy. Rubbing salt into its workforce’s wounds, we now have the news that Peugeot has reached an agreement with Kia Motors to build the 206 in Indonesia, along with unconfirmed reports that the 207 will be built there too. Nothing could better illustrate the illiteracy of EU economics. If we want an increase in employment we should strike the right balance between regulation and flexibility for business. Over-regulation creates artificial jobs, which are not economically justified.

 Mr President, it would be very nice if we were able to throw endless amounts of money at our relatively poor East European neighbours, but history has shown that by doing that you do not make the poor rich, you simply make the rich poor. At an exhibition in Brussels put on by the Dutch Presidency, it was predicted that another ten poor European countries will be joining the EU by 2022: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and Ukraine. West Germany’s experience in pouring almost a thousand billion euro into East Germany shows what it costs to try to create a level playing field for a poor neighbour. The cost of giving State aid to all of these new Member States will be astronomical. Currently the EU is spending over half its budget on State aid. Britain is far from rich as it is. We are being told that our government cannot afford to pay us a decent pension unless we work until we are 70. Our health service is seriously under funded and our navy, which is a fraction of the size it once was, can hardly afford to pay for the fuel it needs to go to sea. Let us stop this crazy idea now before the so-called rich Member States end up totally impoverished. Instead, why do we not help to improve the economies of our European neighbours and of Third World countries by opening up free trade opportunities to them? If this enriches us all, as I think it will, individual Member States might then be in a position to help their neighbours financially; but charity should begin at home.

 Madam President, it is very tempting to offer all of Europe’s poorer regions vast subsidies, but perhaps we should remember that West Germany has already spent some EUR 900 billion trying to create a level playing field for their relatively small neighbour, East Germany. That should ring serious alarm bells, but we are turning a deaf ear. The eight eastern European countries that have already joined the EU, plus Bulgaria and Romania, have been promised EUR 139 billion out of the total structural funds budget of EUR 336 billion for the period 2007 to 2013. An exhibition that the Dutch Presidency put on in Brussels last December predicted that another ten impoverished countries will join the EU by 2022. Based on Germany’s experience, the costs will be absolutely astronomical and attainable only if the big three Member States – Germany, Britain and France – are prepared to impoverish themselves in the process. It is about time we scrapped this whole crazy idea and helped out those poorer countries by creating opportunities for increased trade, tourism, etc. I can well believe that Tony Blair will agree to impoverish Britain in his quest for European popularity, but I cannot imagine Mr Chirac doing the same thing to France.

 Mr President, while we sympathise greatly with the citizens who find themselves in this invidious position, we in UKIP believe that the situation in Valencia over land grab is one which should have been dealt with by bilateral agreements between Spain and the individual countries concerned. Instead, I suspect the European Parliament is once again using a sledgehammer to miss the nut. Town planning is a field that needs to remain at local level in order for the needs of local areas to fall on understanding ears. A centralised policy would compound, not ameliorate, the problem. We have seen that time and time again with so-called European projects. Let me remind you of a few examples. Firstly, we have the common fisheries policy, with its seriously damaging quota system. Hailed as an environmental project, it has done near irreparable damage to fish stocks. A huge proportion of fish processing plants in the United Kingdom have been forced to close and local fishing economies have been devastated. And how can we talk about disasters without mentioning the CAP, which created wine lakes and butter mountains and is now giving Commissioner Mandelson as much of a headache as it is the farmers in the developing world? In essence, Chirac, by protecting the little French farmer, is holding the world to ransom. Instead of stabilising the prices of primary product markets, the EU is harming the very people it says it wishes to help. The situation facing those non-Spanish nationals in Valencia, including many UK citizens, should be dealt with on a government-to-government basis. I lament the fact that the British Government has failed to reach a bilateral agreement with Spain on this issue. Instead, we see the EU octopus bureaucracy once again using private misfortune to plunder the sovereignty of Member States.

 Mr President, perhaps the Commissioner could explain what he means by a ‘tird’ pillar. It sounds rather unsavoury to me. Is not the real problem of the implementation of the directive on occupational pension schemes that there is no political will for its implementation? In western Europe there is a serious demographic problem as the population grows ever older, with the birth rate continuing to fall in the leading industrial countries of the European Union. There is a major pensions crisis, which national governments are simply failing to address. In the case of final-salary schemes, as indeed with public service pensions, the concept is that young people pay for the old; that one generation supports the next. It is not only the demographics that are against the old economies of western Europe, but also the so-called social model. This much prized social model seems to consist of 40% youth unemployment, welfare dependency and the break-up of the traditional family. Thanks to the economic absurdities of this place, as well as of national government, we cannot rely on the generational support system any longer. Indeed, in the United Kingdom, it is politically even worse: there are over GBP 800 billion of unfunded public service pensions, with recruitment in the public sector out of control. Pension funds in the private sector have been taxed since 1977, taking over GBP 5.5 billion every year out of ordinary people’s savings, whilst politicians enjoy privileged pensions at the expense of the hard-pressed taxpayer. Indeed, if public companies now fail to show pension liabilities in their accounts, the director would face prison, yet national government finance ministers flout the rules daily. In my own constituency there is a company called Ballast Nedam which has simply abandoned its pensioners in a most disgraceful way and set up a new company to avoid its responsibilities. This is quite against the directive, which has failed to be implemented. Is it not interesting how keen governments are to standardise car heaters, windscreen wipers and spirit bottles but, when real people need help, as usual the European Union is found wanting?

 Mr President, the British Deputy Prime Minister has been here this week, so it is timely to have a report centred on two of his pet subjects: regionalism and gobbledegook. My plain-speaking constituents have no time for regionalism and I doubt if they would be interested in strategic spatial impact evaluation procedures. Mr Guellec clearly does not pick up simple messages from ordinary voters. His fellow Frenchmen rejected the EU Constitution, yet it is an essential ingredient of his report. That is no surprise, for the rapporteur's own website has a whole section devoted to the Constitution, including a table of key dates. The most recent key date for Mr Guellec is 29 October 2004, when the Constitutional Treaty was signed in Rome. The day of the French referendum, 29 May 2005, is not even a minor detail for him. He said that territorial cohesion becomes an essential objective of the EU in the Constitution. Sadly for him the Constitution is not an essential objective for French and Dutch voters. What is territorial cohesion? The rapporteur can only tell us that the first formal attempt at a definition comes from the Commission. Who ever heard of such nonsense: to suggest a project and then attempt a definition? How typical of this mad European Union. The rapporteur says that regions are the best qualified level to determine needs. He should visit the so-called region that I represent. The regional authority in Exeter cannot possibly know what is best for Gloucester, Swindon or Penzance, all many miles away. The ordinary people in those areas do not think so. Perhaps Mr Guellec is not bothered what those ordinary people think, as long as he can emphasise that his beloved EU Constitution strengthens the role of the regions. The only problem for him is that ordinary people in his own country do not agree with his approach. He certainly achieves cohesion in one respect, because ordinary people in all parts of the continent will be equally confused by his report, and he is equally out of touch with all of them.

 Mr President, cohesion policy has been at the heart of the European project from the outset and it is a policy dependent upon the concept of regions at the expense of nations. In many countries, not least the UK, regions are a wholly artificial concept. It is only a short step from artificial regions within the nation states to artificial regions straddling them. If European groupings of cross-border cooperation make that step they will be entities with a legal personality, with their own statutes, organs and budgetary rules. The Commission explicitly states that EGCCs are a means of overcoming the major difficulties in carrying out cooperation due to the many national laws. This is a momentous development hidden away as usual behind dry jargon. Conservative-controlled Kent County Council will love all this. It has already set up an unofficial cross-border region – Transmanche – with Nord-Pas de Calais, but the people of the UK will not even accept attempts to set up regional governments within their own borders. I assure you there is no way they will accept regional government from beyond them.

 Mr President, when Mr Juncker came to this Parliament in January to set out his presidency’s priorities, the UK Independence Party reminded him that he had spoken about a window of opportunity to cut a quick deal on the EU budget, including the British rebate. We pointed out that Mr Juncker was under the impression that he could revise in just six months arrangements that had taken five years to negotiate. I do not know whether Mr Juncker was being naive or arrogant, but last week he counted the cost of it. It has been suggested in the media that Mr Blair allowed the rebate to be discussed when such discussions were not necessary, thereby falling into a trap laid by President Chirac who wished to distract attention from the French ‘no’ vote. In fact the rebate was always going to be discussed last week because Mr Juncker was determined it should be. His window of opportunity was almost closed, the curtain rapidly falling across his presidency. Mr Juncker is right about one thing: the EU is in profound crisis and for that we can look back in gratitude upon his six months at its helm. I would also like to thank Mr Juncker for his verdict on the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes. His quote, ‘I want to believe obstinately that neither the French or the Dutch have rejected the Constitutional Treaty’, will go down in history as being typical of the attitude of the EU’s political elite in the 21st century. I come from Devon, where we are often referred to as simple country folk. Despite – or perhaps because of – my simplistic outlook on life, I found the EU Constitution incredibly easy to understand. It is abundantly clear that if you wish to see your country retain its independence, you have to vote ‘no’. Clearly the French and the Dutch share a Devonian’s ability to understand it. What part of the word ‘no’ does Mr Juncker not understand?

 Mr President, before turning to the question of Natura 2000 itself, I would like to raise an objection to the way in which the Committee on Regional Development was bulldozed into an emergency meeting on this matter on Monday night. There was very little time to consider. We were told there would be an enormous outlay of EUR 6 billion, and now the Commissioner says that a minimum of EUR 22.75 billion will be made available for the 2006-2013 period. To compound matters, there was only one translation available, in English. I was disappointed to see the Committee on Regional Development voting in favour, although it did not do so unanimously, as Mr Hegyi stated, as I and several others voted against. This episode is a perfect illustration of the cavalier way in which this Parliament too often goes about its business, and that is no laughing matter given the profound effect the EU has on people’s daily lives. Natura 2000 is a case in point. Although we all appreciate that the environment is very important, the livelihood of human beings has to be the priority. Natura 2000 has had a negative effect in this regard. Let me give a good example from the Czech Republic, where an area has been designated to create feeding habitats favourable to partridges and quails and to reduce the erosion of soil and nutrients. My Czech colleagues tell me that this has been very good for the quails, but disastrous for the human beings who live and work there! In the United Kingdom too, chalk downland, dry bog and hedgerows have been destroyed in the name of EU standardisation. The Habitats Directive, from which Natura 2000 derives, seeks to establish a common framework for nature protection as though wildlife were subject to academic theory. Nature, by definition, cannot be standardised, nor can real human lives, which is why UKIP opposes the dead hand of the EU wherever its grip extends.

 Mr President, around the world, fish conservation is only effective when it is under national control. I have spoken to dozens of fishermen in Devon and Cornwall who know precisely how to conserve fish stocks, but nobody ever asks for their advice. I suggest that the current common fisheries policy, with its totally unworkable quota system designed by office-bound bureaucrats, should be scrapped immediately and replaced by a new fisheries policy designed by the fishermen themselves. The problem for Britain has been the strict enforcement of the CFP to the nth degree, first of all by MAFF and then by Defra. One example was their insistence that a fisherman called Ken Bagley – whom I happen to know very well – should rub his thumb on the underbellies of five tonnes of sprats to ensure that there were no immature herrings in the catch. In the UK we say 'it takes a sprat to catch a mackerel'. Perhaps we should be saying 'it takes a sprat to catch a herring'! Little wonder that Britain's GDP for fishing has gone down from GBP 561 million in 1964 to GBP 520 million in 2003, despite inflation. In Norway, which controls its own fisheries policy, the figures have increased from NOK 7.5 billion to NOK 10.1 billion over the same period. The environmental crisis in the North Sea is man-made. It is a classic stratagem of the European Commission to exploit such a crisis in the cause of closer European integration. This is known as a beneficial crisis. Europe's solution to something which is not working is to put even more Europe into it, thus a new fisheries agency is created, based in Vigo, Spain. Surprise, surprise! In future, British fishing boats will be policed in our own territorial waters by patrol boats operating under the control of this new agency and sent out on the authority of the EU's inspectorate based in Madrid. Poor old Francis Drake must be turning in his grave. Perhaps we should get ready to light the beacons! (Applause)

 Madam President, ‘arrogance’ is the word that springs to mind when reading this lengthy report, because the text is redolent with it. For instance, paragraph 25 laments the fact that the funds available ‘do not, as they stand, allow the Union to assume its role as a global player’. The same paragraph refers to the EU having the ‘capacity to assume its role as a global partner’. Whoever wanted the EU to have such a role? Why does it have such an inflated sense of its own importance? Certainly no one in my country has been given a vote on the development of the EU as a global player. We were told it was a common market, which would provide cheap wine and nice holidays. I also note that the ‘global player’ wants its trademark for use in all communications with the masses and wants a major information campaign for the 2009 elections. For ‘information’, read ‘brainwashing’, because the EU will no doubt sell itself as the greatest benefit to humanity since penicillin, rather than the grotesque enemy of democracy and freedom of thought that it really represents. The aforementioned arrogance spills over into everything it touches. There is no better example than the recent disgraceful and disrespectful treatment of President Klaus, a head of state, at a meeting in Prague by Members here. I put it to you that the EU has no democratic mandate whatsoever for the empire-building outlined in this budget.

Nanny Brussels likes to be in control of everything, including what we eat. Putting itself in charge of what children eat at school is the first major step in that process. The propaganda angle is that each piece of fruit will have an EU label on it and the whole project will be supported by a massive publicity campaign. In regard to the fruit market, I understand it will create a great many opportunities for mischief such as mandatory rules that all fruit must come from inside the EU. In the case of bananas, this could at a stroke rule out British suppliers who obtain their bananas from British Commonwealth Caribbean countries, and thus it will provide a lucrative new opportunity for the French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique.

We voted to reject the report because we don’t want any kind of European Common Immigration Policy. We feel that it should be up to individual states to decide who is expelled from their territory and under what circumstances. Whilst we almost never vote for any legislation, we would like to point out that we did vote in favour of Amendment 75, which rejected the Commission’s proposal for a common expulsion policy, but not for the reasons/justification given by the group which tabled the amendment. We had our own reasons for rejection. This is regardless of the fact this directive does not apply in the UK. It is the principle behind this that drove our voting decision.

 Mr President, the massive fuel oil price increases we are talking about today may well be the straw that breaks the camel’s back for many British fishermen. They are already worn down by the endless regulations and quota cuts spewing out from this institution and bringing their industry to its knees. Now they are in the invidious position of being unable to put to sea in order to catch the meagre amounts of fish they are still allowed to land, because the cost of fuel makes it unprofitable before they start. The British Government has for many years abandoned them and has done so again in respect of fuel subsidies to help them through their present crisis. Some of the fishermen in my area have been forced to seek a legal review of their situation because under the CFP they are supposed to be guaranteed a living from fishing. The UK Independence Party believes the CFP is an unmitigated disaster that Britain should pull out of, to regain control of its own waters while it still has some fishermen left.

 Mr President, in the limited time I am allowed to comment on this lengthy report, I would like to make two observations. First, it contains a great many empty platitudes about the supporting paperwork MEPs should provide to support claims from their parliamentary assistants’ allowance. In the light of recent events it is painfully clear that the arrangements currently in place are wholly inadequate, as they are subject to gross serial abuse by many Members. Furthermore, it is equally clear that there is no serious intention to do anything about these abuses, as I understand the system will not change before the new Parliament convenes in autumn 2009. Therefore I cannot take the report’s censorious tones at all seriously. Secondly, I draw Members’ attention to the rather sinister clause 55 of the report, which reveals that, as from 2008, European political parties may be financed up to 85% from the European Parliament budget. It then goes on to point out that this high level of subsidy entails an additional degree of responsibility with regard to their activities. In other words, the EU finances political parties and also controls their activities. This is Big Brother writ large and provides even more evidence of the disastrous decline of democracy in Europe generated by this increasingly totalitarian European Union. As a democrat I abhor it, and to those who support it: shame on you.

 Mr President, let us be honest. The EU satellite radio navigation programmes are an unmitigated disaster. The private sector has been quick to spot the pig in a poke and has shown Galileo a clean pair of heels. But is the EU prepared to accept the obvious and abandon the project? No, far from it. Instead, we have this report, which advocates not only that the project should go charging ahead, but that the European taxpayer should pick up the entire cost. It asks for, in this case, a massive increase in the budget, from GBP 120 million to GBP 715 million. In other words, we are seeing the beginning of an open-cheque-book situation for this shameful project. The United States has its own satellite system, GPS, and therefore the EU must have one as well; this is the guiding principle behind Galileo. It is kindergarten policy-making which defies common sense, has no credible economic justification and is morally and environmentally corrupt. This institution spends a great deal of time discussing the environment and bringing forward hair-shirt measures designed to force people living in Europe into a kind of permanent guilt-ridden existence over their carbon footprint. Yet here we are pushing forward a project whose impact on the environment will be almost beyond calculation. Has anyone stopped to consider the carbon footprint of launching into orbit the 30 satellites required by the Galileo system, which will require the burning of massive amounts of rocket engine propellant? The EU’s environmental credentials are already highly questionable, because of the depredations of the CFP and the CAP, not to mention the unnecessary provisions of Parliament’s two buildings, here and in Brussels. I call upon all Members here today, especially those who see themselves as environmental warriors, to examine their conscience and to oppose this colossal white elephant. We do not need to duplicate facilities already available from the American GPS, and we certainly should not inflict so much unnecessary carbon pollutant upon this environment.

 I am in favour of the EU promoting the rights of the child. One recent example I would again draw to the Commission’s attention is discrimination against children’s right to travel with airlines withdrawing facilities for unaccompanied minors to fly. If they did the same for the disabled or any other similar group there would (properly) be an uproar, but apparently the EU thinks it is perfectly in order to remove children’s rights in this arbitrary way. At the same time there has been some controversy over paragraph 127 calling for ‘Member States to ban headscarves and the hijab, at least at primary school’. I voted against the paragraph because of both the ambiguous wording and the fact that I believe this is too important an issue to be dealt with as a peripheral part of such a report. Nevertheless I would be disappointed if such a practice was to become common in Europe’s primary schools.

 Madam President, the rapporteur’s explanatory statement is instructive in that it depicts cross-compliance as a condition for continued public support, and tells us that farmers are now being paid for ‘complying with Community legislation in the field of environment, public, animal and plant health and animal welfare’. It further states that such regulations are very strict compared with standards in the rest of the world. That neatly encapsulates everything that is wrong with the EU’s attitude to agriculture, with an aggressive regulatory regime diverting farmers away from their natural ambit of producing food and turning them into guardians of the environment, or what this report calls rural development policy, all of which adds mightily to their costs and reduces output. It has also had the effect of putting farmers into direct competition for funding with establishments such as country parks and wildlife preserves, which would not naturally be their competitors. I am aware that the intention of this proposal is to simplify cross-compliance, because it is openly admitted that it has created a heavy, bureaucratic burden for farmers and for Member States to enforce. It is my contention that it was a bad idea in the first place, and simplifying it is to merely administer a band-aid rather than a cure. As usual, in EU parlance, ‘simplification’ means more standardisation and more control by the Commission. Again, the major differences inherent in agriculture across the wide diversity of climates prevalent in the EU do not lend themselves to such standardisation. This report enthusiastically trumpets the view that cross-compliance is an important instrument in justifying public support for farmers. I doubt that even one per cent of the public would have heard of cross-compliance, never mind understand what it means. For real simplification, let us do away with cross-compliance altogether and let farmers get on with what they do best, which is to grow crops and rear animals.

 Mr President, we have a baker’s dozen! We have now reached 13 years of unapproved accounts. It is not new auditors that are required, but a new payments system. It never ceases to amaze me how many politicians in this House, and the one in Westminster, are prepared in good conscience not only to continue to tolerate the parlous state of the EU accounts, but to continue to increase the amount of taxpayers’ money given to the EU. As usual, we get the same round of excuses for incompetence and turning a blind eye, the principal one being to put the blame on the Member States, but that just will not wash. How can the European Commission hand over money to the Member States without seeing paperwork confirming how and where it is spent? I cannot imagine any other professional organisation allowing this to happen, and for so long. If Member States are not prepared to provide the necessary paperwork – i.e. receipts and cheques – then the financial tap should be turned off. In fact, the tap should be turned off at both ends. If the EU is not prepared to put its house in order, then the politicians at Westminster should stop pouring taxpayers’ money into the EU bucket, which still seems to have more holes than a colander!

The UKIP would always seek to cooperate internationally on these matters, however, the EU has no agreed competence on defence.

Obligatory PE is an issue for head teachers and boards of governors, not for the EU. In any case the EU has no competence on sport.

 Madam President, this proposal for a directive on soil protection has huge credibility gaps. Firstly, soil contents and qualities in different parts of an individual country vary considerably. How much more variance will there be between the soils of 27 different countries with vastly differing climates? It is absurd to suggest that the EU can introduce a one-size-fits-all directive on soil from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia. Now a word on behalf of our already hard-pressed farmers, many of whom have written to my constituency office to strongly question the need for a directive on soil protection. They have quite rightly pointed out that they have a vested interest in protecting the soil, because it is their livelihood. They also suggest that it would place another onerous burden upon them because of the failure to give enough recognition to existing national legislation. The second large credibility gap is provided by the EU’s short-sighted open border policy, which has encouraged mass immigration from Eastern Europe to my country. This has generated the need for a correspondingly huge programme of house building on every square inch of land available – some three million new homes by 2020, we are told. Even the green belt is under threat. Burying vast acreages under solid concrete is not my idea of the best way to protect soil.

 Madam President, it has always been my contention that, far from encouraging competition, the EU in its drive for the mythical ‘level playing field’ wants to stamp it out altogether. This report does little to change that perception. Paragraph 13 supports a common consolidated corporate tax base, which is another step towards a compulsory EU-wide corporation tax, which is fundamentally anti-competitive. This idea is enthusiastically supported by France and Germany, two countries with higher corporate tax rates, which must be salivating at the idea of getting everybody else’s rates up to their level. One of the most stupid pieces of EU jargon that I have ever heard is ‘unfair tax competition’, which is what this clause is all about. There is nothing unfair about some Member States having more business-friendly taxation regimes than others. This encourages competition. State aid gets a bashing in this report, as you would expect, but the report makes the false assumption that all state aid is bad. In Britain, because of EU state aid restrictions, we are rapidly losing the Royal Mail postal service, to the detriment of consumers, particularly in remote areas.

 Mr President, this report is seriously advocating that cross-border healthcare should become a reality under the Services Directive. It states that ‘Member States should treat residents of another Member State on an equal basis with regard to access to health services, regardless of whether they are private or public patients’. It also states that there should be ‘a codification of existing case law on the reimbursement of cross-border healthcare’. Let us be clear exactly what these two statements mean as far as Britain is concerned. The first is saying that a visitor or migrant from another EU country, who has not paid a bean towards the cost of the National Health Service, should be entitled to the same access to healthcare as a British resident who has been paying tax and national insurance all his or her working life, and means a delay in their treatment. The second statement opens the door for the EU to override national governments and lay down the law on how cross-border healthcare is reimbursed, leading inevitably to how healthcare as a whole is funded and managed. A single healthcare system run by the EU is a nightmare too horrible to contemplate; it should never be unleashed on an unsuspecting world.

 Madam President, a good subtitle for this report would be ‘the thin end of the wedge’. I am always suspicious of EU reports which state that they respect principles, in this case full respect for the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States. This is usually a prelude to exactly the opposite happening. This report, despite stating the aforementioned key principle, promptly goes on to equivocate by stating that Member States might nevertheless authorise the Union, for a limited period, revocable at any time, to benefit directly from a share of a tax. In other words, the European Commission is attempting to establish the principle of the EU taking taxation directly from taxpayers in the Member States. This is an enormously dangerous precedent to set and is made all the more worse by yesterday’s revelations about the Commission being raided by the police, with simultaneous raids in various countries. I have been taken to task before for using the word ‘fraud’ in this Chamber. However, it is clear that the police think the word is justified. This report also calls for the gradual abolition of the British rebate, something which I am completely opposed to and will fight to the end to prevent. GBP 40 million a day is enough. Britain cannot be expected to pay any more into the EU’s leaking financial system.

 Mr President, the EU has no competence over sport and nor should it. The Champions League and the G14 clubs across the UK, Spain and Italy, oppose the EU intervention in football broadcasting rights. Bayern Munich is for it; English clubs are against it, yet a UK Sports Minister, Richard Caborn, is here to lobby for the Germans. So much for British interests! Amendment 25, until it was sensibly withdrawn, ordered the flying of the EU flag at Champions League and European Championship matches. Had they thought about Switzerland, who will co-host the European finals in 2008? The fact that the Champions League includes Russia, Turkey and Norway? None are in the EU and there is no EU team. The same amendment also demanded that the EU anthem be played at these matches. But ‘Ode to Joy’ is a complete misnomer to 41% of the population, and 58% of the British population. You know, Schiller wrote ‘Ode to Joy’ in 1785, and his words ‘Oh friends, no more these sounds’, may have been controversial then, given that Beethoven was unfortunately already disabled by deafness when he wrote the Ninth Symphony, but they are appropriate today. And, as for ‘Do you fall in worship, you millions?’, well I can tell you, over 200 million people say ‘no’.

 Mr President, today we are being asked to approve the nomination of European Commissioners from Bulgaria and Romania. Well, I do not approve. I voted against the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, as did many of my colleagues from the IND/DEM Group. My colleagues and I from the UK Independence Party were vilified in 2004 because we opposed the accession, but we did so for several reasons, not least that we are totally opposed to the European Union’s empire-building because it is a thoroughly undemocratic organisation that undermines self-government. We also voted against it because we knew that there would be mass migration from some of the new Member States to Britain – a mass migration with which my country’s infrastructure cannot cope. Two years later we have been shown to be right: an estimated 650 000 people came to Britain from the accession countries during the first year of membership. Furthermore, such has been the drain of skilled workers, that we now have the ridiculous situation in which the President of Poland is putting out statements calling for his fellow countrymen to return to their homeland. Will the EU empire-builders ever consider the immense social cost of their actions? We now stand at the cusp of a tragedy: two further countries, which have recently thrown off the yoke of communism and grasped their freedom, are about to throw it away by taking on the yoke of Brussels, with all its suffocating bureaucracy and its relentless pursuit of power. It will not be many years before Bulgaria and Romania discover what a mistake they have made in subjecting themselves to the will of an intolerant European Commission. It will be like exchanging an iron curtain for a vast curtain of paper, which could end up being almost as big a threat to civil liberties and prosperity as was its predecessor.

 Madam President, I am tempted to ask you simply to read the speech I made last year. The comments from the President of the Court of Auditors sum it up very neatly. Overall, the situation has not substantially changed since last year. In fact, the Court’s press statement makes it abundantly clear that nothing has changed, with comments like ‘due to continue in high levels of error’ and the pièce de résistance
, ‘errors with a financial impact are found too frequently for the Court to conclude that all is well’. The only real difference this year is that the Commission has been more strident in denying its responsibility for the mess. I must thank Commissioner Kallas for providing me with the rib-tickler of the year, when he said that the perception of fraud in the EU finances is ‘highly unfair’ and that the spending of money in the EU is under tight control. Yes, and Santa Claus really does come down the chimney! Blaming the nation states for most of the fraud is an easy way out. The Commission is supposed to enforce the rules and oversee spending. Therefore it must take the blame for all those invisible cows in Slovenia, a country that has only been a member for two years but has quickly learnt to play the system.

 Mr President, events seem to have overtaken this report. In spite of Commissioner Almunia’s comments, its upbeat projections for growth in the euro zone contrast sharply with the economic data released at the end of last week, which put growth in the French economy at zero. There are also signs of faltering growth across the euro zone, which will not be helped by the austere taxation regimes being introduced in Germany and Italy next year to meet the euro zone’s stability requirements. What this report does not tell us is that the Government of Italy is on the brink of collapse because of Mr Prodi’s determination to introduce tax increases and budget cuts demanded by the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs to bring Italy into line with the Maastricht Treaty. It also does not mention the riots in Hungary following the Hungarian Prime Minister’s revelations that he had lied morning, noon and night about the tax increases and public spending that he had secretly promised that same Commissioner. Forcing many of our new members of the EU to abide by deflationary policies designed for the more developed economies of the euro zone is generating weak demand, weak growth and mass unemployment. This report also fails to mention that the Maastricht Treaty has turned the Eastern Europeans into second-class citizens: they have no chance of joining the euro zone in the foreseeable future, while having to manage their economies in line with its requirements. Sooner or later the people of Europe are going to get restless with a system that keeps them permanently in the economic slow lane, while denying them any democratic say in how it should be run.

 Mr President, I believe this report is a long and drawn-out justification for the creation of a European public prosecutor. Indeed, judging by Mr Casaca’s tone, he is positively affronted to find that the law of a Member State should ever prevail over the Commission: heaven forbid! According to this document, to get round the problem we should create a law officer with authority to overrule the laws of Member States. This is to be done ‘in the interests of a more joined-up procedure’, and the other vital reason quoted is to help reduce complexity.

 Mr President, so vast is the range of the initiatives proposed in this document that it should keep the EU bureaucrats happily beavering away for the next 20 years. However, let us examine one of the high points of the EU’s record on animal welfare. In 2001, during the infamous foot-and-mouth outbreak, seven million animals were destroyed in Britain under the EU’s direction; most of them were healthy. I well remember the huge funeral pyres of burning animals. The EU stubbornly refused to allow vaccination, which would have been in the best interests of the welfare of both the animals and British agriculture. It preferred instead the legally questionable and morally unjustifiable scorched-earth approach. Therefore, I do not believe that the EU is in any position to claim the moral high ground on animal welfare and to lecture the Member States about it, never mind the rest of the world, as this lofty document claims it will. We have everything in this report, including the setting-up of an animal protection information forum. Doubtless, this will be another highly expensive quango. Who is going to pay for it? The taxpayers. Who is going to have to do all the paperwork? The farmers, who can barely cope with the current red tape. This document is obsessed with standardisation and uniformity. It appears to take no account of the widely differing farming cultures and climates to be found in countries as diverse as Portugal and Sweden. It takes no account of the already high standards of animal welfare in Britain. It is predicated around the central thesis that the EU can do it better, but that is not so.

It is certainly an odd expression to use in this context. A woman may be desirable but another dopey set of rules for harmonising the way we deal with batteries and accumulators – I think not. However, this legislation places the entire financial burden of introducing these new recycling and disposal facilities on the producer. Surely, in a sane world, i.e. one without the EU, when someone buys a product, he becomes responsible for its safe disposal.

 Mr President, I am somewhat bemused by the European Union’s approach to the bird flu scare. The EU has, it seems to me, made a mountain out of a molehill. There is no evidence whatever to suggest that bird flu has mutated and can be passed between human beings. In fact there is very little evidence that it can even be caught from birds unless there is considerable direct contact with the remains of dead birds. Despite that, in Britain there have been lurid headlines about 320 000 possible deaths and bodies being disposed of in mass graves. This very day, a full-scale bird flu outbreak rehearsal, involving several hundred people, has started in the county of Norfolk, with the dramatic title of ‘Operation Hawthorn’. The theatrical way in which the matter is being handled is creating an atmosphere of hysteria, and the EU has played its part in that by holding well-publicised, international summits to discuss the bird flu crisis. It now wants to set aside EUR 5 million over the next five years for exceptional market support measures to deal with the alleged crisis. There is even what appears to be an open-ended commitment for more funds in 2011. It seems to me that the EU and some national governments are guilty of creating a massive public scare that has severely damaged the poultry industry, with little or no justification. Forgive me for being cynical, but it also appears to be a handy way for the EU to promote itself as a caring organisation. Whatever we are actually dealing with here is a virulent outbreak of public hysteria, generated by a highly contagious burst of over-the-top publicity from the national governments and the European Union. In short, everyone needs to stop flapping around like headless chickens and start examining this matter with a degree of objectivity. If we are going to allocate those large sums of money, they should be used for the production of educational literature that can be disseminated to the public. That material should let the public know that there is actually no risk from properly cooked poultry and that it is perfectly safe to buy it in supermarkets and to eat it in restaurants. Let us stop making a crisis out of a drama.

 Mr President, I am a supporter of the development of biofuels as one of the many answers national governments need to the impending energy crisis. Since the European Union has so profoundly failed to protect my country from price-fixing by European energy companies, the need becomes even greater. However, I do not believe in pan-European actions on these matters, particularly in relation to setting obligatory targets. The EU’s obsession with one-size-fits-all policy-making leads to the encouragement of quick-fix solutions from national governments. We are going down that route in Britain with wind turbine technology. Our countryside is in the process of being turned into a monstrous Meccano set for the sake of meeting renewable energy targets dreamed up by the European Commission. The other problem is the propensity for the EU to bring in legislative regimes well ahead of the ability of national governments to create the necessary infrastructure to support them. Again my country has suffered, not least with the growing mountains of refrigerators awaiting disposal. Interest groups in favour of bio-diesel development should lobby the national government, not Brussels. Our own government is much better placed to come up with suitable proposals for encouraging the sensible development of biofuels in Britain than the EU, which is likely to introduce a regime that will not suit us all. Each nation’s needs are different and it is about time the EU took that on board.

 Mr President, I have read all 15 dreary pages of this document and believe it to be a report of the past rather than a document for the future. The phrase that comes to mind is one often seen on a schoolboy’s report: ‘could do better’. Indeed, if your dream is to change the minds of the people of the European Union, it is a ‘must do better’. We are treated to terms like ‘strategic objects’, ‘policy strategy’, ‘new directions’, ‘effective communications’ and ‘genuine dialogues’. We are promised that more money will be spent on regional funds, cohesion funds, social funds, globalised funds, fisheries funds, etc. – all this to gain the trust and commitment of the citizens. But where are the words ‘freedom’, ‘choice’ and ‘the individual’? George Orwell’s 1984
 comes to mind – except that I believe he got the year wrong, but it is just around the corner; then it will be ‘control, control, control’ of the individual. Given the referendums on the EU, or even the elections, the true sentiments of the people will show that most want to say ‘no’ to this bureaucratic nightmare.

 Mr President, as a British citizen I strongly oppose the budget settlement that Mr Tony Blair purports to suggest that he negotiated in December. I prefer to call it ‘the great giveaway’. Opening your cheque book and asking how much is not my idea of negotiation. Allowing Britain’s contribution to rise from an average of GBP 3 billion net to more than GBP 6 billion per annum from 2007 is totally unacceptable and squanders Mrs Thatcher’s hard-earned rebate. I therefore voted against acceptance of the budget when it came before this Parliament, but I suspect that my reasons were somewhat different to those of most of the other Members of the institution who also voted against it. No major political party in my country, except my own, is prepared to campaign honestly and openly on European issues at election time. It is the famous elephant in the room that everybody avoids talking about. They are helped by a supine media that is only too willing to participate in what is effectively a cover-up. Mr Blair and his government may think themselves very clever in avoiding a proper debate on the EU at the last general election. However, there is a downside. How can they legitimately claim to have a mandate for giving away all this extra taxpayers’ money, most of which will be used to subsidise projects in eastern European countries, at the expense of under-funding our own domestic infrastructure? I have looked at the guidelines in this report and most of it is just a glorified wish list full of buzzwords like ‘European heart’ and ‘raising the game’. In my view, if the EU really is interested in raising the game, it could start by asking for less money, not more, and it should initiate a major study on the means necessary to return the powers it has taken from democratically elected governments. Well, that is my wish list.

 Mr President, it seems to me that the biggest risk that farmers face every year is that agriculture, and ultimately their livelihoods, are controlled by the European Union. The debacle that Britain suffered during the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001, is eloquent testimony to what happens when crises are managed by the EU. It is not widely known that the strategy for dealing with that disaster was managed by the then Commissioner for Agriculture, and what a complete pig’s breakfast he made of that. Millions of healthy animals were needlessly slaughtered in an orgy of killing and burning that shocked the world. Furthermore, the roots of the disaster lay with the EU and its destruction of local slaughterhouses through excessive regulation. I am gratified to see that the report acknowledges that the CAP has ‘encouraged the development of non-sustainable production methods heavily dependent on water and energy’. But, judging by this weekend’s newspaper revelations that the EU has a surplus of four billion bottles of wine, costing the taxpayers a billion a year, not much has been learnt in that area. I would ask Members to reject this report, until a study has been made of the practical implications and the cost of implementing its recommendations. It seems to me that trying to protect farmers against everything, including weather aberrations such as storms, as this report indicates, will be extremely expensive and possibly fruitless in the end, because who can predict the unpredictable?

 Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to register my contempt for a decision taken by a high-level group – which I presume is the Commission – to overrule the Committee on Budgetary Control and reappoint Mr Franz-Hermann Brüner as Director-General of OLAF. Mr Brüner is an immensely controversial figure and his judgement has been brought into question on many occasions. In his first term he supported witch hunts against journalists such as Hans-Martin Tillack who exposed frauds. He has also been criticised by politicians and his supervisory board, and I do not believe he has the confidence of this Parliament, the press or the public. This also demonstrates the utter pointlessness of this Parliament and its committee system. The candidates for the post gave presentations before the Committee on Budgetary Control. We questioned them and ultimately voted for a better candidate from Sweden. Now we find that the whole time-consuming process was a meaningless charade.

 Madam President, this is a scintillating report that runs to 48 pages. It is a tour de force
 of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo and statements of the blindingly obvious. The authors have provided us with such masterpieces as ‘regular inspections of establishments by competent animal welfare inspection authorities would place a considerable burden on farms and greatly increase the size of the authorities. It would also substantially increase costs. These can be curbed by having irregular inspections carried out on a random basis’. I will let Members consider the wisdom of that particular pearl in their own time. This Parliament regularly churns out details like that, prepared by people who probably have not the faintest idea what it is like out in the real world, where real people have to try to put all these new rules into practice and still manage to turn a profit. Not only do the authors of this report wish to see this new regime inflicted on chicken meat producers in the 25 Member States, but they also make it clear that they expect non-EU countries to follow suit. Some chance, I would suggest! I come from a country that already has very high standards of animal welfare and hygiene, which are vigorously policed. We do not need a supranational bureaucratic dictatorship to tell us how to look after our chickens. The authors of this report have laid an egg and I suggest they scramble it.

 National management declarations! Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Kallas, will these be like the EU’s own accounts, in which the directors-general of the Commission sign off their respective departments with reservations, because they have not got a clue where the money has gone? Because if it is so, it strikes me as a little like trying to repair a severed artery with a band aid: too little too late. As everybody knows, I do not believe in the European Union; I regard it as an enemy of democracy, and I approach this from an opposite direction. No nation should be pouring taxpayers’ money into a corrupt system. After 11 long years in which the EU’s accounts have been rejected by its own auditors, this weak-kneed attempt to change the system seems to me like pouring huge amounts of gold dust through a sieve, thinking ‘oh, perhaps we better try and stuff up a few of the holes’. No one thinks about the wisdom of pouring the dust through the sieve in the first place and quite simply the way to stop the dust being lost is to stop pouring. Therefore I call on the Members here present to go back to their various countries and make urgent representations to their own governments to pull the plug. Simply stop paying this monstrous bureaucratic dictatorship, which has no respect for either the governments or the people of Europe. We have a saying in my country: ‘charity begins at home’. Save the money you are currently wasting on the EU, a large part of which is lost simply by fraud and corruption anyway.

 Mr President, I should like to make a point of order under Rule 145. I am afraid that there seems to be a misunderstanding of exactly what we are here for. I thought we were talking about the management directions and the reason we were asking for these directions to come in was because money was going missing. As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, my role has always been to look into where the money has been lost or misused and where mistakes have been made – the phrase that Mr Kallas has just used. I was working entirely on the assumption that the reason we were calling for these declarations was that the Member States would look into where the waste and fraud had come and, maybe, even corruption. It was under those terms that I was asking to express my opinions in my speech.

The surrender of £7 billion of our rebate is unacceptable. The current financial perspectives are a bad deal for Britain.

 Mr President, the previous port services directive was rejected by the last Parliament in the 2003 plenary and, as nothing has changed, why should the Commission expect a different answer this time? Neither management nor staff have shown any encouragement for this legislation. Yesterday, a Parliament spokesman said that the protests had caused considerable damage, but what will be the damage in British ports if this directive is applied? New investment of over EUR 400 million by the management of my local ports of Felixstowe and Harwich may be jeopardised if they have to open the services to other companies. Our British system has worked extremely well for decades, so why should British ports be disrupted when, clearly, this form of legislation is aimed at certain ports on the continent? It is said that there is a need for greater competition in this sector to promote growth and job creation, but if this directive is applied, at what expense? Dockers could lose their jobs, the security systems could break down and the safety issue would be jeopardised. I voted to reject the similar bill two years ago and, as a British Member, I am going to do the same again this week. (Applause)

 Madam President, like the last speaker, I too wonder why we are considering these proposals. Surely the Council made a decision on 22 November and it is now a fait accompli
. However, if Parliament is determined to have its say, we should remember that the sugar regime has existed virtually unchanged for almost 40 years, and yet here we are trying to introduce wholesale change almost overnight. It is a sick system which has badly needed reform for many years. However, the draconian solutions being proposed – that is, the medicine for the sickness – are likely to kill the patient in the process: it is estimated that the new regime will cause the loss of 100 000 jobs in Europe and put an end to sugar farming in countries such as Greece and Ireland. It is also likely to do incomparable damage to the economies of many European former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean, which were major beneficiaries of the old regime. I am also painfully aware that my own constituency in the east of England contains a major part of the UK’s sugar farming. I recommend that a proper study of the effects of the new regime should be made without delay. Never let it be forgotten that our actions affect human beings out there in the real world, beyond our cloistered environment. It is a shameful indictment of this centralised bureaucratic form of government that it has taken so long to act, even then only under pressure from the WTO, and that so many people will suffer as a result.

 Mr President, since I oppose virtually everything that the European Union proposes to spend money on during the budget year of 2006, I cannot be expected to support this report or its motion for a resolution. The European Union is a self-perpetuating mega-bureaucracy that has carte blanche to finance its own programmes. I particularly oppose the allocation of funds for the brainwashing of young people, referred to in this report as being used for advancing the idea of Europe. I believe that even the most backward of students will be aware that the continent of Europe has been around for quite some time and is a bit more than an idea. Bringing secondary school pupils to this institution for all-expenses-paid visits, during which they will be given disingenuous one-sided briefings about the wonders of the European Union, is a crude brainwashing exercise, as is the flooding of educational establishments with equally one-sided literature. The report’s repeated references to the now almost wholly discredited Lisbon Strategy hardly add to its credibility. I would urge any Member of this institution who generally believes in democracy and accountability to the electorate to vote against this budget and any other documents that purport to legitimise it.

 Mr President, here we go again. I stood here nearly a year ago to comment on the tenth anniversary of the European Court of Auditors’ refusal to sign off the EU accounts. I said then and I will say again that it is time to admit that this form of European government is an abject failure and that it should be abolished. The nation states would be far better off looking after their own interests. Personally I would not trust the European Commission, past or present, to look after my grandchildren’s pocket money. Three weeks ago I made a speech in this House calling for the 2006 budget to be rejected on the grounds that this Parliament has no business authorising further expenditure when we have the shame of a decade of dodgy unapproved accounts behind us. Well, this is year eleven; it is a shameful situation that cannot continue. The Court’s latest report is another litany of the failings of European Commission bureaucracy. We were promised that a new computer system would close all the loopholes. The reality is that that the accounts will still be about as watertight as a colander. The Members of this institution should feel a strong obligation to the taxpayers of Europe, for it is their money that is pouring through the holes of the colander. The British Government is under an obligation to spend taxpayers’ money wisely and yet it goes on tamely writing the cheques to the European Union. Make no mistake, I shall go on being the conscience of this institution. I shall keep pointing out what a disaster it is. My conscience is clear. Is yours, I ask? Incidentally, I look at the attendance of Members here today as an indication of the importance they attach to the handling of the taxpayers’ money by the European Union. Enough said.

 Mr President, I find it very difficult to take seriously a debate about voluminous documents that only a real euro-nerd would be able to read, let alone understand. Furthermore, what is the point of a debate about a 2006 budget which we all know will bear no relationship to the way the money will actually have been spent? The European Court of Auditors has, for good reason, refused to sign off the EU’s accounts for the last 10 years and said, in its last report, that 95% of the EU’s budget was open to fraud. Yet every year this House just shrugs its shoulders, sighs and looks the other way. That is a shameful indictment of this institution and demonstrates how pitifully useless it really is. Before we start debating ways to spend next year’s money, I believe we should sort out the mess that has been left behind in previous years. Until the disgusting state of the EU’s finances has been sorted out, this House has no business debating further expenditure. I call upon you all, in good conscience, to reject the 2006 budget.

 Madam President, the common fisheries policy is without doubt one of the most disastrous of all EU common policies. It has inflicted incredible damage on the ecology of the North Sea and has done absolutely nothing for conservation. Not satisfied with this disaster, the EU is actually encouraging its repetition in African coastal waters. You can therefore imagine the cynicism with which I read this proposal for special technical measures to improve the conservation situation in the Baltic Sea. The rapporteur has produced an extraordinarily unhelpful explanatory statement, which is really little more than a blow-by-painful-blow account of a paper trail. At the end there is a complicated appendix which seeks to lay down the law on the specifications for codends and even the exact size and shape of codend buoys. Why this House should be preoccupying itself with such minutiae is beyond me, unless it is yet another symptom of the European Union’s limitless propensity for control-freakism. Doubtless these technical specifications will have been dreamt up by bureaucrats without the slightest experience of sea fishing and will therefore cause enormous problems for the people who have to have such experience and work on a daily basis. I do not believe that the EU has any business in involving itself in conservation in the Baltic, or anywhere else for that matter. These issues should be resolved by sensible negotiation between national government and fishermen, not by an unelected bureaucracy with an absolutely appalling track record for environmental vandalism.

 Mr President, I must congratulate the rapporteur for producing what, even by general standards of EU documentation, is 19 pages of the most unreadable, bureaucratic gobbledy-gook, all of which comes under the laughable heading of ‘simplification’ of the market in fruit and vegetables! Never in the field of vegetable and fruit cultivation has so much been said to so little purpose. However, I would draw Members’ attention to paragraph 46, which reminds the Commission that imports from third countries do not always provide the levels of safety and quality that the European consumer has grown accustomed to: hence the need to guarantee that third country products meet the same safety and quality requirements as European Union products. Roughly translated that means that non-EU countries can produce their goods cheaper, and this must be stopped at all costs. That is crude protectionism and seeks to preserve the EU fruit and vegetable market as a cocooned environment, controlled by suffocating bureaucracy which outside competition must never be allowed to penetrate. However, it is regulations that Mrs Herranz García wants, even on pot herbs and parsley! Rhubarb gets a mention as well, but I shall resist the obvious joke, except to say that unlike the EU, the industry does not want to talk rhubarb, it only wants to grow it! I urge Members to reject this report or, at the very least, require it to be translated from the original bureaucracy into plain language, so that we can all understand.

 Mr President, my comments on the Court of Auditors’ annual report for 2003 regrettably echo my thoughts last year. Little has changed: accounts are not signed off and something like 94% of the data are deemed unacceptable, either unsafe or riddled with error. More than half the Commission’s directors-general signed their declarations with reservations. This is the EU saying ‘I have not got a clue’. It all sounds too familiar. Well, so it should. This has been happening for ten long years. In my country any company that submitted one set of unsafe accounts would be dealt with very firmly, but the EU has got away with it – as I have said – for no less than ten years. The great tragedy is that this decade-long saga of corruption and mismanagement is funded by the poor old taxpayers. There can be no greater testimony to the impotence of this institution than the fact that such a scandal has been allowed to go on for so long. Yet Marta Andreasen was sacked for telling the truth and Parliament adopted a resolution requiring the Secretary-General and President of the Committee of the Regions to present their apologies to an internal auditor for the harassment that he had endured, but this was not forthcoming. It goes on and on. This report attempts to shift the blame for the unholy mess on to the Member States, but we should be under no illusions about where the blame really lies. The European Commission is the exclusive custodian of the monies paid into the European Union by the Member States and it alone holds the power to withhold payments if it observes any form of wrongdoing. Instead the Commission has simply sat on its hands and looked the other way for ten long years. But of course it is not only in this place that people should hold their heads in shame. Mr Blair and his colleagues back in Britain should be holding their heads for continuing to pour taxpayers’ money into the European Union at the rate of GBP 1.5 million per hour when they know full well what a mess the whole thing is. The British Government has an obligation to spend taxpayers’ money wisely. It is singularly failing in this operation. Does this situation not bother anybody? It certainly bothers me and it bothers my party. We look for some changes in the future.

 Mr President, after reading the reports on the proposed budget for 2005, I cannot help but wish that they could also be read by those useful idiots back home, upon whom the British Government so often relies, who keep telling us that the EU is not about creating a giant single State. I should like them to count how many times the word 'integration' appears in the text. Let me concentrate on one issue. I am heartily sickened to read the passages about how many millions are to be aside for bodies that are – to quote the jargon – 'active at European level' or 'information relays'. They are to receive huge handouts, which they call 'Community subsidies for organisations working to advance the idea of Europe'. I will cut through all the jargon and tell you precisely what they are talking about: brainwashing! The European Union is a self-perpetuating political bureaucracy. In its quite unprecedented fashion it can arbitrarily allocate vast amounts of taxpayers' money towards the establishment of chairs in universities and to bankrolling educational institutions with deeply worrying titles, such as 'the College of Europe' or 'the European University Institute', and dozens of others. In total, there is a financial envelope of EUR 77 million over 3 years in this brainwashing budget. This budget is a gross misuse of public money. A large slice of the money it encompasses will be used to brainwash the public into thinking that the European Union is wonderful and that 'integration' really is a nice word. There is nothing nice about misleading people. In my country this is known as leading them down the garden path. We should reject this budget.

 These fisheries deals show the European Union in its worst possible light: greedy, exploitative and behaving like a colonial power. Over the last five years I have campaigned against this appalling environmental degradation and tried to highlight the human cost to the indigenous black African communities. In 2003 and early 2004 over 100 MEPs had, at last, begun to listen. Now I see that opposition has fallen to 70 or 80. The reason, I am told, is that the deals have been reformed. But I would be very cautious about the word 'reform' in an EU context. Invariably it is meaningless. In the case of Africa, it means that some aspects of the deal may be slightly less bad. It is the whole principle that is wrong and that is why UKIP will continue to oppose these deals until that tragic continent gets its fishing grounds back.

 Mr President, what worries me most is the suggestion that the European Investment Bank (EIB) has a significant role to play in solving the financial crisis – that it can somehow act as the Europe-wide body to provide stimulus where Member States have singularly failed to coordinate their own stimuli. The danger is that, if it expands its activities too far into supporting commercial banks and governments – as has been suggested – then its enviable high credit rating may be downgraded, like some of our governments. The EIB has a leverage of about 35 times, and its shareholders are Member State governments. It would be a serious issue if it were to go bust, like some of our commercial banks. The report even encourages the EIB and the Commission to increase lending by experimenting with new innovative financial instruments. I thought the world had seen enough of clever financial tricks.
 John Whittaker,  
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. – 
Madam President, it is hard to believe that we are sitting here today discussing minor changes to the rules on value added tax when EU countries are facing the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression. We continue to pretend that EU economies are not as badly contaminated by bad debt and slump as elsewhere, yet even in Germany output is falling at the staggering annualised rate of 8% and government finances everywhere are stretched to the limit as tax revenue falls and welfare spending rises, and as governments take over private debts and try vainly to stimulate growth. The worst case is probably Greece with its downgraded government debt still 94% of GDP and with an interest risk margin that is today creeping back to 3%. Greece is going to need bailing out – but by whom? Not by the Germans, they say. Even ardent supporters of the great EU project are now having to accept that if Greek debt is not underwritten, Greece may be forced out of the euro zone. Probably of even more serious concern is the huge exposure of several euro zone countries to defaulting debts of Eastern Europe. I almost feel sorry for the Commission. For years it has been trying to do as it was told, upholding the rules on state aid, competition and procurement: rules which are essential components of the project but are now being ignored all round. The saddest spectacle is Commissioner Almunia’s statement this week that he intends to invoke an excessive deficit procedure against Spain, France and Ireland because they have broken the budget rules of the Stability Pact. Mr Almunia – please – the Stability Pact is broken. It never did have any teeth. Never mind that prudent government finances are essential to the survival of the euro, there is nothing else that these countries can do about their budgets. No doubt the gestures towards European Union will continue, but democratically-elected governments have a primary interest in looking after the populations that elected them. France and Germany have made it clear that their fiscal stimuli are there to help their own industries and workers. Obviously coordination is only for the good times. Economies are in dire straits all over the world. Some of them will pull through. If some European Union economies return to prosperity, it will not be thanks to the European Union or to its rules on VAT.

 Mr President, you could have guessed what these reports would say. We have got a problem and the European Union has got to give its opinion. It has got to give the impression that it is in the driving seat to solve the problem. So we have a European Economic Recovery Plan of which the car industry is a part. But in reality each manufacturer is going to look after itself as best it can, and each country will look after its manufacturers as best it can. There is of course a possible case for some support, some financial support to the car industry and other sectors to keep capital intact and to keep skills intact. But this can only be decided at the national level because the support – apart from the European Investment Bank mentioned by Mr Verheugen – can only be provided by national taxpayers. But there is one thing that the European Union could constructively do here, at least until the recession is over, and that is to give car manufacturers a break from environmental restrictions. The industry is already in serious trouble. These environmental and other standard restrictions make cars more expensive. You are helping to kill off an industry which is already in serious bother.

We agree that children should be protected from sex predators, cyber bullying and other dangers on the internet. However, we have two objections to this legislation – firstly, the fact that it allows the EU to gain more control over the internet, and we feel the EU already has a near monopoly on media channels. Secondly, we do not feel that the shadowy Europol agency should be involved in any kind of law enforcement. We feel that the appropriate vehicles for child protection are national parliaments and national law enforcement agencies, who can devise appropriate internet child protection. This will have the democratic legitimacy only national level assemblies can confer and the operational effectiveness only national law enforcement can deliver.

 Madam President, the financial crisis rages on and euro-zone countries are facing recession. The answer, we are repeatedly told, is that we need more regulation to make the financial sector work better. But we have a problem now, and changing the rules after the problem has arisen is not going to help us with that problem. I urge Members to consider a completely different reaction to the current economic difficulties. They are a signal that we cannot continue as we are and that, thanks to borrowing that has been too cheap and imports that have been too cheap, we have all been living above our means and we cannot go on consuming at the same rate. Adjustment will be painful, but it is necessary, and in these hard times there is another message that is even more salient but will not be heard in these institutions. It is that the EU cannot continue with its massive legislative programmes in the name of health and safety, consumer protection, social equality, for instance, for the overriding effect of all these schemes is to add costs and to crush the productive activity on which our very prosperity depends. In these hard times, the one message that should be heard is that European countries can no longer afford the European Union, its institutions and its immense outpourings of legislation.

 Mr President, doesn’t this all go to show that this vast exercise of EU financial regulation has singularly missed the mark? In its obsession about money laundering and pursuit of the elusive single market in financial services, the EU has been pursuing the wrong objectives. Let us accept that, despite earlier assurances from Mr Trichet and Mr Almunia and others, there will be further financial failures in the European Union, and real economies in the EU will be affected by the credit crisis. So there is not much point now in discussing capital requirements and what we will do in the future to stop this sort of thing happening again; we have a problem, and the problem is now. We can blame the Americans, we can blame hedge funds, we can blame investment bankers, we can blame who we like, but what Mr McCreevy’s Commission might rather spend its time now doing is discussing with the finance ministers of the different countries how the burden will be shared across countries when we find that we have to bail out financial institutions to the tune of hundreds of millions, as is now happening in the USA. How are we going to come to the aid of Italy, Spain, Greece and Ireland – Mr McCreevy’s own country – when bad situations there are made worse by the crisis, and, stuck in the euro, there is nothing that those countries themselves can do to help themselves?

 Madam President, these reports bring the usual wish list of incompatible objectives: security of energy supply, an efficient energy market, reduction of CO2
, harmonised rules for all countries and cheap energy for pensioners. Well, cheap energy for some means that the rest of us pay for it. Perhaps we think we shall win friends by forcing governments to provide subsidised energy to those suffering from so-called ‘energy poverty’. Is there no area of activity in which the EU will trust national governments to do what they think is best for their own peoples? One thing that these reports should highlight, but do not, is the foolishness of the targets for carbon and renewable energy. The oil price is high and likely to remain high, yet the cost of energy to consumers is going to be higher still in order to subsidise renewables. Ironically, sustained high oil prices are just what is needed to reduce CO2 
emissions. They will reduce consumption and stimulate the development of alternative sources far more effectively than any number of targets and directives. Who knows? We may eventually find that wind power becomes viable. In the end it will be very hard to impose harmonised unbundling rules across 27 Member States, irrespective of the benefits that this may or may not bring. Countries would indeed be foolish to rely too heavily on their neighbours for energy supplies. When the lights go out, when hospitals have no power, national interests are going to prevail irrespective of orders from the proposed EU regulator. That is how things are.

We are obviously in favour of Britain receiving money from the European Union as a contribution to the cost of floods last year. We therefore support this motion. However, we take this opportunity to place on record that we do not favour this arrangement under which Britain must apply to the European Union for assistance. The UK is a large net contributor to the EU budget. Rather than having to plead for a small amount to be returned to us, we should prefer to retain our funds and decide for ourselves how they are spent.

 Mr President, I am pleased to know that Britain should receive money to help us with the cost of last year’s floods. We are all very happy that the EU has generously come to the aid of a Member State in difficulty. But it is not quite like that: first, the grant is only 3.5% of the cost of the damage – a gesture, as Mr Ashworth says – and, secondly, it is nine months after the event – and that is fast, they say! It would have been more helpful if we had known it would be forthcoming, and then reconstruction could have been planned accordingly. If there is one thing that gets up the nose of the British – when we realise that we are getting back a little of the cash we have paid into the European Union – is that we are obliged to beg for it and then advertise the EU’s generosity. Please, can we not rather keep our own money and then decide how to spend it ourselves? That way, it could be paid out more quickly.

 Madam President, it really does no good to keep talking about the Lisbon Agenda, because every year for the past eight years it has been universally acknowledged that it has not worked very well. This report, with its huge list of what the European Union should do, completely misses the point. Rather than the EU being the force that drives growth and productivity, it is the EU, with its endless interference in business, that is holding back the economies of Europe. Another point which is ignored is that the different economies of the EU have vastly different structures and performances. It makes no sense to talk about the European economy as a single entity. Contrast Germany, which has been enjoying some modest economic growth, with the southern EU countries variously afflicted with huge trade deficits, collapsing housing booms and enormous government debts. What these countries desperately need is lower interest rates and devaluation, which cannot be delivered because they are all in the euro area. If the European Central Bank reduces interest rates to provide some assistance, it will have to ignore its inflation target, which would certainly not please the Germans. Surely, rather than continuing to add millions more words to the sterile discussion of the Lisbon Strategy, some attention should have been paid to these rather more pressing issues. But I suppose that would highlight the fundamental weakness of economic and monetary union, which is that a single currency is not a sustainable long-term arrangement for a group of widely differing economies with independent governments.

 Mr President, the rapporteur claims that this initiative will encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to expand their cross-border business. But I have little doubt that it has been heavily promoted by the large multinationals, because it is they that stand to benefit most. In my country, in Britain, the vast majority of businesses are small, and they provide for some 70% of employment. Only a tiny proportion of these have any interest in foreign operations. But my main objection is that it is more meddling by the European Union in taxation matters. Judging by the EU’s record of value added tax, there will be endless changes to the law. We have had eight directives on VAT so far, and it is still a mess and prone to fraud. Businesses operate best when there are simple, well understood rules, as Mr Schmidt has just said. The EU knows how to do only one thing, and it does it to perfection. And that is to make things complicated. So, contrary to the views of other Members, a much better plan would be to encourage tax competition. Then those nations that have the lightest and simplest taxes will attract the most businesses.

 Mr President, I see from this report that there is to be no relief from this programme of spending our money to promote gender awareness, interfering in business hiring decisions and forcing firms to offer flexible working and generous leave arrangements, but nowhere do I see any recognition of side effects. There is no understanding that much of this social engineering is largely self-defeating. The simple logic, like it or not, is that if it costs more to hire women, then fewer women will be hired, despite the rules that prevent employers from mentioning gender in job advertisements and interviews. All legislation designed to prevent discrimination against women, or old people, or minorities, has the undesirable result of demeaning those who would have achieved without the legislation. All our jobs, for women and men, depend on the wealth generated by the economy. Most jobs are provided by small businesses. Well, unlike in this Parliament, out there in the real world of small business, women and men are employed and they earn money by producing goods and services that other people are happy to pay for. This obsession with promoting gender equality is just one of many sources of interference in small business. If we continue to add more cost and more restrictions, then business will hire less and pay less. In the end we might be more equal, but we shall all be poorer, both women and men.

 Madam President, economic growth is higher, unemployment is down, government deficits are falling a little, but concerns are now being expressed that this growth may be threatened by the strong foreign value of the euro. While Mr Juncker does not share these concerns, Mr Sarkozy and others have been calling for active management of the exchange rate. Mr Mitchell’s report draws our attention to the rules that give Member States the responsibility for exchange rate policy, and calls on Eurozone finance ministers to coordinate their influence on the exchange rate with the European Central Bank. The report then says that this action should not undermine the ECB’s independence to use its interest rates to control inflation. We do not seem to understand how it works. The way to bring down the value of the euro is for the ECB to reduce interest rates. But then it would have to abandon its inflation target. In these days of free capital flows it is not possible simultaneously to control inflation and the exchange rate. There is another way, of course, and that is to impose exchange controls. Maybe this is really what they are thinking. It would not be out of keeping with Mr Sarkozy’s remarks about defending French protectionism and it would also be disastrous for the market economies of the Eurozone.

 Madam President, the financial services action plan is a huge, complex body of regulation. In the vain attempt to harmonise financial products and to legislate risk away, the only effect will be to drive business out of the European Union. Even the City of London is now realising that the costs of compliance with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive are likely to be far greater than any benefits from greater market access. And there are always unwanted side effects. The rapporteur complains that not enough is being done for the retail consumer of financial services. She says the basic needs for every citizen are access to a bank account, financial transfers at low cost and the possibility to save or borrow money. But the largest impediment to retail banking is the highly bureaucratic know-your-client procedures that banks must follow as a result of the EU’s own money-laundering regulations. In English, we would call this ‘shooting yourself in the foot’.

 Mr President, the rapporteur accepts that government finances in several euro zone countries are still not in good shape. Sovereign debts in Italy and Greece have not fallen significantly, and although deficits have been falling, this is a result of some higher economic growth helped by global recovery. It is not evidence that the Stability Pact is working. However, this week’s news from Spain has shown that weak government finances are not the only threat to the functioning of the euro. Spain has an awful trade deficit of 9.5% of GDP, and its construction asset price boom, which has driven domestic demand, is now definitely over. The boom was driven by euro interest rates which had been far too low but are now too high. Spain can now look forward to serious economic difficulties, with rising unemployment and deteriorating government finances. The normal solution to this dilemma would be for Spain to lower its interest rates and devalue, but neither of these options is available as it shares the single currency. There are therefore three possible outcomes. The first: to forestall a crisis, the European Central Bank reduces the euro interest rate. Germany would not like this, as it would lead to rising inflation; it would also mean the European Central Bank losing its hard-won reputation for holding down inflation expectations. The second possible outcome is that Spain leaves the euro zone and re-establishes its own currency, enabling it to devalue and have suitably low interest rates. Yes, we have come to the point when this may no longer be unthinkable. It would lead to serious problems of private and public sector debt default that would spill over across the whole euro zone. Other countries would not want this, which makes the third possible outcome maybe the most likely, and that is large-scale bailout by other countries, despite Maastricht rules against this, and this would be accompanied by centralisation of control over Spanish public finances. I do not know which of these outcomes will take place, but it is time we faced up to the circumstances: Spain is a large country and the European Union would not find it easy to stand idle while it suffers in recession.

 Madam President, time and again we hear the plea from the Commission, ‘It’s not our fault! How can we police our Community money?’ That is, Member States’ taxpayers’ money is spent by the Member States. Indeed, we have the remarkable event last year of the Commission castigating the Court of Auditors for picking on them. But perhaps the Commission has a point and this line of thinking has persuaded the governments of the UK, Sweden and the Netherlands to agree to declarations about the future management of EU funds – for what that is worth. More deeply, the Commission’s point shows up the essential weakness of the system. The agencies in Member States that spend EU money have little incentive to worry about the taxpayers in some other Member State who provided it. So what do we do about this? Well, I shall continue to tell the people of my country that waste and financial irregularity are an unfortunate but inevitable consequence of the system – a flawed system in which the disconnection between the taxpayers who provide the funds and those who spend them becomes ever wider.

 Mr President, on a technical matter, the rapporteur is concerned to have rigorous separation of payment services from other commercial activities, which must mean banking business. The purpose of this separation is, presumably, to minimise risk. But all payments, apart from a tiny proportion of cash payments, are transfers between bank accounts. Hence banks are the natural institutions for operating payment systems, and I doubt that such a separation is either feasible or even desirable from an efficiency point of view. This directive states that it has the worthy objectives of increased competition, transparency, consumer protection and so on. I wonder whether it will turn out like other financial directives such as MiFID, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, for instance. Many people in the City of London have now realised that the costs of compliance with MiFID are far larger than any potential benefits.

 Mr President, the climate change initiative has been raised to the very top of the agenda. Despite serious doubts about the extent to which CO2 causes global warming, the EU is determined to lead the world in reducing emissions. But, apart from nuclear power, sources of energy other than fossil fuels are still far from viable. This is true of renewables in particular. We now have a binding target of 20% for renewable energy with no proper assessment of the methods of achieving this ambitious goal or its cost. Permit me to mention a lesson from the kindergarten school of economics. If you raise the cost of a resource, you make goods more expensive and you reduce competitiveness. We are told that this initiative will stimulate innovation in renewable technology and improve exports. Instead, it will make us all poorer. I suggest this sudden obsession with carbon emissions is a distraction, an attempt to take our minds off all those other projects that have had disappointing results, such as the Lisbon Strategy, immigration and asylum policy, reform of the common agricultural policy, the euro and several more.

 Mr President, there are over 100 clauses in this report on energy security, and nearly all of them call on the Commission to do something: to fix the carbon trading scheme, to foster investment in the European energy market, to encourage energy efficiency, to do more and more. The Commission is going to be busy. I want to question two assumptions about this ambitious programme. First, it is assumed that the Commission somehow has the ability to address all these problems, as if it had a magic wand. Second, it is assumed that the EU Member States can be persuaded to cooperate. They will cooperate, as long as it is in their interest to do so, for instance, in selling surplus power – at a profit – to neighbours. But when national energy security is at stake, all the Commission’s powers will not be enough, and nations will look after themselves. Compare the ‘cooperation’ over fishing that has brought several common species close to extinction. My biggest worry, however, is that so much of what we are asking for, such as trying to meet impossible targets for carbon dioxide and renewables, pays little regard to the economic cost. I fear that implementation of many of the recommendations in this report will be as economically damaging as the REACH Directive, which this Chamber triumphantly approved yesterday.

 Mr President, here we are again telling the European Central Bank how to do its job! Not only is this against the spirit of the Treaty, which states that the ECB is independent, it is also largely a waste of time, because, as always, the ECB will listen politely but, quite rightly, take little notice. Indeed, the ECB has enough trouble of its own, without listening to this Parliament, in finding an interest rate that suits 12 different economies, soon to be more. The one-size-fits-all problem does not go away. At the moment, the larger euro zone economies are enjoying slightly higher growth but, as Mr Trichet accepts, this is fragile. When it falters, his problem of choosing the right interest rate will become more critical. Effectively, the ECB will be forced into a choice between inflation in Germany or recession in southern Europe, with all the dire implications for government debts that this will entail. I wonder what advice this Parliament will be giving then.

 Madam President, one can understand the desire to define the scope of EU interference in the provision of public services. It helps if you are running a business or a public service to know what the rules are, but I am appalled that this should hinge on defining the distinction between services of economic general interest and services of non-economic general interest. Surely, all services are economic in the proper sense that they have an economic value, otherwise they presumably would not be provided. I fear that attempts at such a definition will merely cause more confusion, less efficiency and more scope for ambiguous judgments from the European Court of Justice. At root, the problem is that national and local authorities must have sovereignty over the management of public services, because public services are paid for by national governments on behalf of their electors. Yet here we are trying to make public services obey a common set of EU rules. Has anyone spotted the inherent contradiction? Mr Barroso has outlined an ambitious programme of work for the Commission. I say to him: please just leave it alone. Please let national governments do their own thing.

 Mr President, they do not give up, do they? Despite the Commission’s insistence that this proposal is not aimed at tax harmonisation, it will force countries that apply tax on registration of vehicles to phase that out and it will make all countries apply the same level of emissions-linking to the so-called ‘annual circulation tax’. Is that harmonisation, or is it not? The rapporteur gives the game away when she argues that in the long term it would be of great advantage to approximate the ACT rates – meaning the same rates of road tax in all countries. They simply do not understand that allowing countries the freedom to choose how much revenue to raise and how to raise it is a fundamental responsibility of our elected national governments. Moreover, competition over tax rates and tax bases between national authorities is actually a good thing for business and economic growth – witness the general reductions in company tax over the past few years. The worry is that when the EU gets involved it inevitably screws up. For instance, despite eight directives on value-added tax so far, the administration of VAT remains as complex as ever and fraud is now running into billions. Unfortunately the drive for tax harmonisation in the European Union remains alive as always. I sincerely hope, though, that this particular piece of legislation may be stopped.

 Mr President, the Muscat report applauds the consolidation and merger and acquisition activity that has been taking place in pursuit of these elusive economies of scale and scope. However, I am not aware of any evidence that consumers are more satisfied, that risks have been reduced or that the cost of capital has been reduced. On the contrary, the main effects of the financial services action plan to date seem to be that financial services at all levels – retail banking, stockbroking, investment banking – are all being rather seriously hampered by onerous and largely unnecessary reporting requirements. However, the issue I want to highlight – and which the report acknowledges – is crisis management, or, to put it more bluntly, who bails out. Sooner or later some large multinational bank is going to get into difficulties, not necessarily through bad management, but simply because banks, like any other business, can go bust. Banking, like any other business, is risky. There will be calls for bail-outs and guarantees to forestall contagion and to prevent the breakdown of the payment system. At that point, cooperation between the national authorities becomes non-cooperation, as each national authority strives to limit its own financial liability. Nobody has thought this through. The report mentions the lender of last resort without telling us what it is or how it is going to work. So, instead of the blind pursuit of the single market in financial services, I believe it would be prudent not to encourage any more consolidation or cross-border merger activity for the present, until such time as the European Union has a single fiscal authority to take the potentially large financial responsibility when things go wrong. Fortunately, I think that time is very far in the future.

 Mr President, a bit less fraud here, a bit more fraud there. This report is a sad catalogue of failure – failure to direct enormous amounts of EU funds to where they were intended. But this is just one of the ways in which EU funds are wasted. Despite all the apparent good intentions, a large proportion of the cash is spent on daft projects that advertise the EU or support the disgraceful common agricultural policy; and all this has spawned a whole industry of bureaucrats who exist merely to produce the relevant paperwork for applying for and dealing with the grants. Another huge waste. EU money is easy money – provided you fill in the forms nicely, or forge them. The whole system has fallen into contempt. Where is the incentive for Member States to use their own resources to police the use of the funds?

In considering the issues raised in this report it is necessary to make clear that whilst I am opposed to intolerance I do think that the criticism of the new Polish Government is counterproductive and that it is up to the Poles to democratically resolve these issues. In addition it must be understood that Poland is a profoundly Catholic country and the people as a result will reflect their Catholic beliefs in exactly the same manner as Muslims reflect the Islamic view on homosexuality. It is rare that Parliament, if indeed ever, criticises Muslims for holding such views and it only reflects double standards if Catholics are to be treated differently.

 Mr President, this issue shows up the most basic weakness in the whole EU structure. All countries agree to be bound by the same body of EU law, which they then undertake to enforce upon themselves. It must have been obvious from the start that some countries would apply EU law more vigorously than others. So what we are now seeing is the beginning of attempts to harmonise criminal justice, notwithstanding Mr Gargani’s request for checks and limits. The ECJ will have a wonderful time deciding whether national sentencing meets its criteria of being proportional and dissuasive. Mr Gargani acknowledges that it will be hard to achieve uniform enforcement. Indeed, do we really expect courts to behave in the same way in all 25 EU countries, including our new eastern European Member States and those who are yet to join? I fear that politicians will agree to progressively harmonise enforcement, but the peoples of our different countries will not.

 Mr President, this programme assumes that research and development activity can be improved by taking tax from individuals and businesses, then paying it back to businesses to be spent on research that would not be otherwise undertaken. Is there not something wrong here? If the research work would not otherwise be undertaken, then this is probably because the expected payoff from the research is too small to justify the expenditure. The EU deceives itself into thinking that it knows how to direct funding towards the right kind of innovation. It is more likely to direct the funding into waste and bureaucracy. I have a better plan: tax our businesses less and stop suffocating them with too much regulation and interference. Allow them to reap the profits from their good ideas, and I believe we would see an explosion of innovation. We would also see greater employment and economic growth: all the things this place says it wants to achieve but will never learn how to achieve.

But there is nothing more likely to cause observers of the European Union to yawn or sigh or say, ‘oh, no, not again!’, than talk of the Lisbon Agenda. Can we not accept that the Lisbon Strategy has sunk, just like the Stability Pact has sunk, which is most unfortunate because that is what underpins the euro currency? If the Lisbon Strategy has not sunk, why do we keep needing to relaunch it? We all want economic growth and jobs; we all want the economies of Europe to thrive. However, it must be time to recognise that we do not have the right formula. Rather than being the force that drives the necessary reforms, it is the EU with its endless regulations and interference that is holding back the economies of Europe. Recent modest improvements in some European Union economies have been achieved despite
 the European Union. They are more a result of global development. The economies of the EU do not need a Lisbon Strategy: they need to be left alone to let markets work and to let entrepreneurs create jobs. Can we not see that by continuing to talk about the Lisbon Strategy, the European Union is emphasising its own impotence? Therefore I recommend a period of silence: stop talking about an agenda that, year after year, has been universally acknowledged as a failure.

That is how politics works, never mind promises of solidarity and Treaty obligations. This particular complaint is that we do not have equal treatment of workers from third countries across the Union, but nor do we have a free market in services, nor do we have anything approaching a uniform application of European Union law. Perhaps the most glaring example of broken rules is the Stability Pact, and without budgetary discipline the euro currency will not last for very long. Whenever some states misbehave we ask the Commission to do something, but the Commission cannot do very much and I am not convinced that Mr Frattini’s information drive will help.

 Mr President, one of the principles of good taxation is certainty, both of the bases of assessment and the tax rate. Yet the only certainty about the proposals to harmonise the base for company tax is that they create uncertainty. If the negotiations follow the pattern of development of the European company statute, for instance, it will be decades before we have a settled position. Continuing changes in tax rates and tax rules and the prospect of future changes are bad for business. In this report, as in early Commission reports on this subject, it is accepted as a matter of faith that the single market must be pursued without question, with the elusive level playing field as the means to achieve it. If we are to harmonise the base for corporate tax, why insist that tax rates should not be harmonised too? It does not make sense. Like Mr Konrad, I suspect that uniform rates are on the future agenda, despite the denials. There is much to be gained from simplifying tax rules in the individual Member States, particularly the older ones, but this has to be a matter for those Member States. If the Member States see a need for cross-border cooperation on tax matters, this too should be their concern and not that of the Commission or the European Court of Justice. My recommendation is leave it alone. Then the countries that prosper and attract investment will be those with the lowest tax rates and those with the simplest and least bureaucratic methods of assessment and collection. If taxation is to be made more business friendly, this will be at the initiative of the individual Member States and driven by market forces. I fear that coercion by the European Union is the wrong way to achieve tax reform.

 Mr President, Mr Becsey’s report on the minimum standard rate states that the European Parliament’s ultimate goal is to contribute to boosting economic productivity and growth rates in the EU. Whilst these are noble sentiments, I hope you will allow me to offer a few words of general advice. The current growth projection in 2006 for the eurozone is estimated by the IMF at 1.8%, with the largest economies being the worst performers. This weak growth is far from sufficient to sustain the EU’s social programme. The Commission suggests that a cut in income tax of 1% of GDP would produce a greater than proportionate rise in growth. A harmonised VAT scheme, therefore, should be used to shift from direct to indirect taxation. Unfortunately, there is no undisputed evidence that this growth would occur. Moreover, this shift implies a redistribution from the poor to the rich, like the common agricultural policy, which rewards landowners rather than farmers. Is this really what we want? I should like to suggest that instead of trying to harmonise taxation, our partners in the Commission should rather leave it alone. Do they not realise that their obsessive pursuit of the illusive level playing field and their inward-looking regulation-led policies are damaging growth rather than stimulating it? The working time directive, the temporary workers directive, the common agricultural policy: are all examples of a European Union that refuses to wake up to the reality of global markets, free trade and efficiency, but is instead intent on pursuing an outdated social model, which has no place in the global economy. Harmonisation should be the last thing on the agenda of any national government that wishes to see its country’s economic growth rise. In contrast, a dose of genuine deregulation would bring wondrous results.

 Mr President, capital requirements are regarded as useful in preventing bank failure because they make shareholders bear more of the cost of failure. The international Basel II proposals, which this directive implements, are designed to achieve a better match between capital and risk than the simple 8% capital asset ratio of Basel I. However, no amount of bank capital, short of 100% of risk assets, can safeguard against failure. The minimum amounts of capital specified in any regulatory scheme are arbitrary. As Mr Radwan stressed, other problems are the extent to which risk-spreading amongst individual banks of a banking group should imply a reduction in regulatory capital, and the difficulty of defining the division of responsibility across national supervisors. There are no objective answers to those vexed questions. For that reason I question the competence of this Parliament in this field. It is ridiculous that we should be involved in the minutiae of this directive given how complex and yet how important it is. But this is how Parliament works, with all of us Members, however experienced or inexperienced in the arcane arts of banking regulation, expected to make hundreds of reasoned judgments on questions, many of which cannot be answered in any objective way. The rapporteur recommends that, owing to doubt, this directive should be reviewed in the future. The banking industry does not need that. Banks spend their time dealing with risk and uncertainty. Adding further uncertainty over future regulation will not help them to plan or look after our interests as customers and shareholders. The bottom line is that there is no right amount of regulatory capital. If we kept that in mind when legislating, we would come up with rules that are a great deal simpler, and the Members of this Parliament would be spared from the farcical exercise of voting on hundreds of amendments.

 The best tax systems are those in which the rules are well understood, simple and unchanging. Taxes that stay the same help businesses to plan for the future with confidence. Yet we have had a continuous stream of directives and regulations on VAT. While the current proposals purport to simplify, particularly for small businesses, the main drive has always been rather to harmonise - to prevent so-called 'harmful tax competition', to achieve a uniform minimum rate for VAT, ending derogations such as the zero-rated items we have in the UK. Ten new member states give harmonisation additional impetus. Why do we need harmonised VAT rates? To help the single market? But we shall never achieve a single VAT rate and since there seems to be little effort to harmonise the much greater differences in rates of excise duty, one has to look for other motives. I suspect that the ultimate objective sought by the Commission is to have VAT centrally administered and collected, guaranteeing a continuing source of funds for the EU budget not subject to bickering between EU member states. We should be aware of this possibility and not allow it to occur.

 Mr President, EU institutions keep telling themselves that the euro is a success. If only the public realised what a success it is, euroscepticism would vanish and people would all come to love the euro. The problem, we are told, is lack of knowledge. Hence the drive to spend EUR 16 million on a communication and information campaign giving neutral and factual information. Unfortunately, the neutral and factual information is not likely to persuade EU citizens in the desired direction. All the large eurozone countries, and several of the smaller ones, are struggling with poor growth and rising government debt. The rules of the Stability Pact have been flouted all round and no honest observer can try to claim that the new flexible pact has any teeth, although the Commission has recently been pointing the finger at Italy. Yet we all agree that fiscal discipline is necessary if the euro is to endure as a multinational currency. So how do we measure success? Easier travel, says Mr Maaten; lower interest rates, says Mr Trichet. But lower interest rates are more a response to poor growth than a sign of success. While the ECB must be applauded for its achievements with consistently low inflation, Mr Trichet’s deputy admits that the euro may have been part of the problem, accepting that the ‘one size fits all’ interest rate is not appropriate for countries with different inflation rates and business cycles. The euro has not succeeded in its aim of binding EU citizens in ever-closer union. The euro has not succeeded in forcing countries to adopt the structural reforms that are necessary for the long-term health of eurozone economies. Is that the information that will be provided under this initiative? It should be, because that is what is relevant to people’s wellbeing. An objective appraisal would admit that in creating the euro the EU has tried to create a silk purse from a pig’s ear. It is now obvious that what we have is indeed the pig’s ear – perhaps not something we should be boasting about too loudly. Have we learned nothing from France and the Netherlands, where the efforts of governments to obtain a ‘yes’ in their referendums on the Constitution merely hardened opinion against it? To spend money now promoting the euro would be foolish and irresponsible. It would also be typical of the head in the sand arrogance that we have come to expect from the European Union.

 Mr President, I do not know why we are having this debate. Mr Karas acknowledges that the Stability Pact relies on Member States disciplining themselves. He needs to go a step further in deducing that, for that very reason, the pact cannot work; it never could work. So I regret that his well-intentioned attempts to try and make it work by tightening definitions will be in vain. Rather than pretending that fiscal discipline can be achieved, we should consider the consequences when it is not achieved. Let me focus on Italy, where the deficit has now been shown to have been above the 3% margin for several years; debt is 106% of GDP; inflation is making the economy increasingly uncompetitive and economic growth is negative. The real danger here is that these conditions will culminate in a credible threat from Italy to reissue its own national currency, enabling it to devalue and thereby regain competitiveness without painful and prolonged deflation. Such an action would have serious Argentina-style results for Italy but could, nevertheless, be seen as the best course of action. But a decision by Italy to re-issue the lira would undermine confidence in the ability of the euro to survive as a multinational currency. Other EU countries would then be faced with the prospect of providing the Italian Government with large-scale financial assistance to persuade it to stay with the euro.

 Mr President, I shall make some remarks on the economic policy guidelines. We spend a lot of time lamenting the poor performance of the large euro economies, but are economic policy guidelines going to make them perform any better? The guidelines might be better described as a wish list. Governments are urged to maintain sound fiscal policies, increase flexibility, hold down wage rises, improve competition, promote research and development and develop a strong industrial base, all worthy things that governments would like to achieve anyway, but do they need the European Union to tell them so? Rather than giving this advice, I have a better plan. Get off the backs of individuals and businesses, scrap regulations instead of inventing new ones or tightening existing ones like the bureaucratic controls on financial transactions that we were discussing in this House last night. Most of them do not work properly and all of them add costs to business and destroy jobs. Unfortunately, making more rules is the only thing that these institutions are good at. If we could just leave business alone to generate wealth, the EU’s many programmes, such as caring for the environment and providing a high level of social security, might actually be affordable.

 Mr President, I find it hard to believe that nobody questions the need for this legislation. As Mr Nassauer says, we do not actually have any evidence that the existing legislation works, so making it tighter is hardly justifiable at this time. The European Union is going out of its way, as usual, to make life difficult for ordinary businesses and citizens, and hindering business activity. Much more sinister, in my opinion, is the obligation on professional advisers not to inform their clients when they report suspicious transactions to the authorities. Turning professionals into secret informers erodes trust within society and marks the beginning of a police state. A better way to address terrorism is to know who is entering and leaving our countries. Alas, with the ongoing disagreements about how to police our borders and the drive for indefinite expansion of the Union, the prospect of reliable border controls is becoming ever more remote.

 Mr President, in the European Union, we are very good at sanctimonious rhetoric about the need for poverty reduction in poor countries. But whatever the appearances, this is not what today’s discussion is about. As Mr Almunia has made clear, it is about influence. I will not comment on Mr Wolfowitz’s suitability to lead the World Bank, but the European Union’s initial hostility to him has softened. The EU needs support for Pascal Leumi to head up the World Trade Organization and for its candidate – perhaps Baroness Amos? – to lead the United Nations Development Programme. Hence the comment of Action Aid that EU support for Mr Wolfowitz is a stitch-up, and similar remarks from other NGOs. Whilst I will not diminish the value to poor nations of assistance from the World Bank and the European Union, fair trading conditions would be of far greater value to them than any amount of aid or debt relief. Trade, rather than hand-outs, allows poor nations to help themselves, as the Indonesians were pleading after the tsunami. Unfortunately, the EU seems to excel in poverty creation in pursuit of its own agenda: for example, paying cash to Mauritania, Angola and Mozambique for the right to fish out their coastal waters and impoverish their fishermen; or economic partnership agreements under which the European Union tries to buy poor nations’ acquiescence to its protectionist policies. No doubt the rhetoric will continue. The reality is that self-interest rather than philanthropy drives the EU’s actions, and this self-interest is best served by the EU having its own people in the top jobs.

 Mr President, Mr Goebbels' report is a frank admission of much that is wrong with the European Union. He has recognised that high economic growth is necessary to achieve low unemployment, to pay pensions and to achieve what is here called 'social cohesion' or 'social protection'. So why is growth so poor? Several speakers have blamed the Stability and Growth Pact. Some say it is being interpreted too strictly and that governments are not spending enough. Others say the opposite, that we must stick to the Pact more tightly. They cannot both be right. I suggest that both sides are missing the point. Mr Goebbels says we will raise growth by promoting competition, enterprise, entrepreneurship, initiative, and risk-taking, particularly among small- and medium-sized enterprises. Let me analyse this. I agree that small businesses are important; large multinationals have all the influence, but create jobs outside the EU. However, I do not believe there is a shortage of small business opportunities, investment capital, or entrepreneurs who would be prepared to take risks in setting up businesses and taking on employees. So why is this not happening? And why, when it does happen, do so many fail? It is because we have gone out of our way to make it hard for them. Go and talk to small businessmen. You will hear the same story repeated everywhere: too much red tape and too many rules, particularly those connected with employing people. These difficulties occur because the whole spirit of the EU is to use centralised direction in a vain attempt to achieve an idealised society by making laws and restricting activity. Examples of this include the Working Time Directive and the large numbers of rules introduced to uphold various rights, each of which has the major effects of crushing enterprise and enriching lawyers. The whole ethos is biased against the employer. We all want high employment and to live in a compassionate, cohesive society. However, this is only possible when we have wealth. In trying to achieve our ideals by means of coercion, we kill off the source of our wealth. The whole model is in drastic need of revision. My colleagues in the other British political parties still cling to the idea that they will be able to persuade the European Union to change its ways. In the UK Independence Party we have recognised that this will not be possible. The only way to preserve some prosperity in Britain is to leave the EU. We want our EU neighbours to prosper too, but when they fail to do so because of blind adherence to a flawed model we would prefer not to be dragged down with them.

 Mr President, we all recognise that there is a case for promoting competition in the interests of economic efficiency and Mrs Kroes has promised to continue the work of her predecessor in routing out unfair state aid and cartels wherever she can find them. I want to suggest how she could do much better than this. Our rapporteur Mr Evans notes that the competitiveness of European business is one of the key objectives of the Lisbon Agenda. Unfortunately, too often competitiveness in the EU is too often taken to mean that every nation and every company has to suffer under the same regulatory burden or the same 'level playing field'. This is not really the same as competition. Dare I extend Mr Hökmark's remarks and suggest that if the Commission is truly interested in promoting competition it should include regulatory competition. This would be a much richer source of efficiency. Give nations some freedom to determine their own agricultural policies and to decide for themselves how they want to ensure their own health and safety. Allow nations to set their own rules over everything that is not directly concerned with trade or other matters of common interest. A radical suggestion maybe, but it would allow competition from the more lightly regulated economies to provide the spur for lighter regulation elsewhere and we shall all prosper. For those EU regions that are struggling to converge, relief from over-regulation would surely do much more good than any amount of handouts from the diminishing pool of Structural and Cohesion Funds. Mr Barroso has made some cautious remarks about easing regulation but I fear it is unlikely to occur. If meaningful deregulation could be achieved then all the sorrow about the failure of the Lisbon Agenda could be turned to rejoicing as EU economies really begin to move out of the sick bay.

 Mr President, in EU countries about one fortieth of tax revenue is spent by EU institutions. In Britain, we are told that this is a small price to pay for the privilege of trading with our neighbours and for the prosperity the EU has brought us. However, we are beginning to recognise, as kindly confirmed by ex-Commissioner Kinnock, that we do not need to be in the EU to trade and cooperate with EU countries and that our prosperity might well be higher if we were not in the EU. They also tell us that the EU budget is small in comparison with national budgets. However, national budgets pay for some useful things, such as defence, education, health care and pensions. The EU budget pays for subsidies to agriculture – subsidies that agriculture would function better without. It pays for regional projects that would otherwise not have been considered worthwhile. It pays for poorly targeted overseas development aid. It pays for auditors to find out that 93% of reported spending was unsafe or riddled with errors. It pays for this Parliament. Let us stop arguing about how much should be spent on this or that project or initiative in vain pursuit of the Lisbon Agenda. Let us look at the broader picture. As the last speaker has just said, several countries with their own budget problems want a limit of one per cent of GNI. The Commission rightly points out that it must be much larger if the expectations of the new accession countries are to be fulfilled. How much larger – two per cent, four per cent? If the EU were genuinely concentrating on the ideals it keeps proclaiming – peace, prosperity, strong economies – it would be acting very differently. It would not be looking at these various projects: it would be opening its markets properly, internally and externally; it would cease killing off our businesses with thousands of ill-judged prescriptive rules, and its budget could be a small fraction of one per cent of GDP.

 Mr President, it is clear that the larger eurozone governments have no intention of tying their hands by promising to adhere to the 3% deficit limit. One would not expect them to. The Stability Pact is rather like the common fisheries policy: every country has an interest in other countries keeping to the rules but in not being restricted itself. The fisheries policy is not working very well, nor is the Stability Pact, but – to maintain the pretence – we are now going to have a more flexible pact taking into account economic growth rates and country-specific circumstances. It sounds like a good idea, but in practice all these criteria depend on judgment, as Mr Almunia has just explained. All it will mean in the end is that a country having trouble sticking to the rules of the pact does not have to. A flexible rule ceases to be a rule. The root of the problem is that there is no credible means of enforcement; there never has been. It was always ridiculous to suppose that a government having trouble paying its bills could be punished by imposing a fine; yet, as the European Central Bank points out, sound fiscal policies are vital for the euro. There are many examples of what happens to fixed exchange rate regimes when governments do not keep their budgets in order. An EMU is just a sophisticated form of a fixed exchange rate. Argentina is the most recent case of such a collapse. The problem could of course be solved by much greater control of national budgets, but that does not seem very feasible right now. Certainly we in Britain would not like to see Brussels running our Treasury. Let me end on a positive note. I can only say how thankful I am that Britain has not joined the euro ...

 Mr President, since the 1970s, British politicians have sworn the EU is not about political domination or loss of sovereignty, yet EU presidents state that we pooled our sovereignty and have a European empire, which makes 75% of our law. This Treaty signs away our ability to rule ourselves, yet a BBC poll says that 84% of the British people want no more power surrendered. Like mushrooms, the British people are left in the dark and fed manure. The Conservatives, through the EPP Group, gave their allowances to the ‘yes’ campaign in Ireland, then deviously promised to allow a referendum – but only if Ireland votes ‘no’ again. Behind the backs of the British people and with no mandate, the Westminster parties have sold their country away, while the polls show 55% want to leave the EU.

In 35 years, that is more law than England has made since King Richard III in 1485. So, here we are, making legislation to correct legislation. Where will it all end?

 Madam President, in this building there is an insatiable demand for power and control – levels of control which previously only the USSR would have dreamt of. EU controls that kill innovation and EU power to distort market demand, flying in the face of what the voters expect. Now even the sky is not the limit. Under the excuse of efficiency, the EU – one of the most inefficient bureaucracies in the world – wants to control efficiency in the sky. The EU seeks to put obstacles in the way of innovation from free-marketeers such as Easyjet and Ryanair because they please the public, and we know how the EU ignores the public. The EU wants a functional air space block system coordinator: a fancy title for a dictator ruling over air traffic control, airports and also industry. This is the same kind of over-control that eventually sent the USSR into oblivion, but all for the sake of flying whose flag? This is all about EU flag-waving. It is not to satisfy the public and has nothing to do with demand. Success depends on efficiency and meeting demand as can only be achieved in the free market – not by damaging EU controls, not with EU lack of understanding and not with EU lack of expertise as displayed in this building. Let us resurrect efficiency by allowing the supply to feed the demand and allowing innovation. This is not the business of the EU. Please vote against.

 Mr President, the Commission was defeated by the UK before when trying to impose harmonised measurements – caught like graffiti vandals altering UK road signs. But they do not listen, and Mr Markov is going to put road safety standards under the control of an unelected Commissioner. Amendment 5 is good: ‘Several Member States already possess well functioning road safety management systems. These countries should be permitted to continue using their existing methods’. Will some countries be more harmonised than others? Which countries? Please name names. UK roads have high safety standards – for instance, too many speed cameras. Why not harmonise those? Please take away as many as you like. Amendment 53 requires harmonisation of sign visibility and readability, and 49 requires harmonised road signs and markings. Is this readability designed to confuse UK motorists in 35 EU languages? What is it? Is the rapporteur proposing huge road signs with massive texts so motorists can pick out their language at a distance? Or maybe parking bays so motorists can get out and read it all? What next? UK distances are in miles, with stopping distances in yards. The EU is about harmonisation, not people, so the unelected Commissioner will take away UK imperial distances and traditions via the back door without asking the people. The title of this report should be ‘EU cannot read the signs’. Well, the writing is on the wall. Keep your distance, listen to the people, not to politicians.

What concerns me about this report is words like ‘pricing policy’ and ‘tax on fossil fuels’, because no current serious alternatives exist and these taxes are very inflationary. The future must be about encouraging innovation and technology, not about tricking people who have no alternative into paying more tax. Most public transport systems are good for the commuter but do not fit the needs of the businessman who must drive into work in order to use his car to visit clients later. But the city of Strasbourg provides a first-class tram system, with a tram stop outside this very building, so why are MEPs here in Strasbourg not leading by example? They do not visit clients, they just come here to misrule Europe. Yet almost all of them use chauffeur-driven limousines and ignore the trams. If MEPs complied with their own words, then perhaps the public would listen. In simple English, Madam President, this House is guilty of gross hypocrisy.

The people may only vote to support what the EU elite want. It is a one-way street. The French and Dutch people voted against this irrevocable union.

 Mr President, the Commission’s Interoperability Directive admits that it is about enabling ‘citizens of the Union … to benefit to the full from the advantages deriving from the establishing of an area without … frontiers.’ This vision is a burden to the UK because many of the EU population buy only one-way tickets. I am pleased that isolated, narrow-gauged and preserved railways will be exempt. But what about secondary rail routes? Presumably, all this extra paperwork allows Luxembourgers, Latvians and Lithuanians to line up and run services from Long Eaton to Letchworth. I know it is mainly about freight trains, ‘non-stop from Lisbon to Liverpool without changing locomotives or train crews’, says the briefing. Some hope! What will the crew say about the Working Time Directive? Also, it will be stopped and checked for illegal immigrants west of Folkestone. Current Portuguese locos would come off the track before the Channel Tunnel, as the rails in France are too narrow. This train will stop.

 Madam President, UK pesticides were tightly controlled in 1985. Firms like Syngenta say that farmers should not be denied the tools they need. These regulations move us away from the principle of good, science-based regulation. For example, pavement weed control is 400 times more expensive without chemicals. The golf and field sports industry says that without pesticides it is not possible to maintain the turf. The Crop Protection Agency says that banning pesticides means between 65% and 200% more land under cultivation, reducing productivity. Corbett Farms say that this year has shown the value of spraying to prevent potato blight. Pesticides are expensive and the lowest amount is used to protect our crop. Decisions on how and when to spray must be taken on an individual field basis. An arbitrary reduction in use cannot be scientifically based. Madam President, please eradicate the EU’s pestilent regulations. UKIP will vote against.

 Mr President, harmonisation of railways across 27 states has very little attraction to the UK. Competition may be good for commerce, but you can leave us out, as we will deal with the economics of running our own service. If the standardisation process necessarily involves change of track widths, widths of platforms or changes of voltage on electrified lines, as it will in some parts of the EU, then good luck to you all, but leave us out. Such is the magnitude of legislation from this place on railways that we will be surprised if a private operator can be found who can jump through all the hoops at anything like economic cost. We have only one rail link with the continent and this passes through a very useful tunnel. Bearing in mind that we are all being railroaded by these directives due to one single tunnel, it may lead some to say that the Channel Tunnel should be concreted up in the middle and the British and the French could then use their respective halves for the safe storage of nuclear waste. This would eradicate the expensive need to harmonise a rail link to the UK, as no rail link would exist. Please try to control the endless stream of directives from this place. Or, to put it another way, railways run on sleepers; what a pity this place does not run on similar lines.

 Mr President, managing a postal system delivering to every part of the UK six days a week, as experienced by the British for more than a century, is a UK issue, not for EU rubberstamping. Efficient mail delivery encourages business, especially in rural areas. It is a public service. The Royal Mail may require subsidies to deliver to remote outposts, including Scottish islands. That is a matter for central and local British Government, not the EU. The EU concept favours more junk mail which is not required by the British, nor by their recycling bins. As usual, the EU wishes to micro-manage every aspect, destroying methods which have worked well for years, whilst dictating rules which limit innovation. The EU meddling with the UK postal system is as foreign to me as Britain fiddling with the Flemish, Finnish or French letters. You may expect that I should welcome postdating of the full market to December 2010. In fact, I reject the entire directive on the simple British principle of mind your own business and we will get it sorted, not the apparent EU directive of stand and deliver while we envelop you in red tape.

Is it any wonder they have the highest growth rates in Europe? However, I must warn them that this has ended. It will all be downhill from here. Latvia will adopt the euro in 2008, Lithuania and Slovakia in 2009 and Estonia in 2010 and they will be hamstrung by EU regulation, EU targets and by the EU continually meddling in their economic affairs. I think we should all worry when the report informs us that the European Union must play a more active role in determining economic policy. One size does not fit all and individual countries know best how to find their markets, manage their economies and trade with the world. Please give them economic independence.

 Mr President, all this week we have been told that this is a bright new dawn, with Parliament having a new President and Members. However, as this report demonstrates, we still have ‘leaves on the line’. At the first reading in 2005, Mr Sterckx said that we must not tinker with international agreements that are already satisfactory. I would therefore remind him that the COTIF Convention is a practical agreement between 42 individual nations, including many non-EU nations, to facilitate railway travel between them, yet today Mr Sterckx wants this agreement to be derailed. He is lingering under the impression that neither Member States nor domestic rail companies are capable of establishing codes of passenger rights on their own. That is certainly not true in the UK. Mr Sterckx says this is really about consumer rights, yet it is conceded that more regulation means higher fares. Why do my countrymen need EU regulations when they get higher fares? But Mr Sterckx has not drawn up a report about consumer rights. It is about EU control. The rapporteur says there is no point in drawing up regulations which only apply to the 5% of rail passengers who use international services, so why are we doing this? There is a lot of EU regulation which will not affect the vast majority of people with no cross-border interests, but which at the same time damages the ability to provide domestic services. In the EU, Mr Sterckx, the cross-border distinction is irrelevant, and until the EU gravy train finally hits the buffers, it is all unstoppable. Behind all this week’s self-congratulation, that remains the real truth.

 Mr President, yesterday the President, faced with a directive about a paperless environment, whispered ‘dream on’. The EU is behind the paper curtain or, in real English, the big EU paper wet blanket. Over-regulation closes businesses and the EU paper wet blanket is putting out the fire of enterprise and the ember of innovation. The single market, we were told, was about trade, not about paper regulations on how to ride a moped. Or are you resisting an invasion of British mopeds on the beach at Dunkirk? Dream on! Certain EU states treat EU papers as joke sheets enforced by paper tigers with paper teeth, but they still sit on committees like nodding paper dogs generating more crazy paper regulations for the rest of us and filling in paper forms for expenses, while not enforcing simple rules about crash helmets. It is now only a matter of time until such a paper dictates that the British will drive on the right hand side! In this report, the EU has ignored its own research paper, according to the British Motorcyclists Federation, which says that these proposals are inept and ill-conceived. The BMF has pointed to the motorcycle accidents in-depth study showing that most motorcycle accidents are the result of low-speed urban collisions, usually the fault of the car driver. It was funded by EU taxpayers at EUR 2.5 million and this directive will now be a EUR 2.5 million waste of paper. The BMF says that motorcycling elements in the directive are diametrically opposed to the UK Government’s own motorcycling strategy, do nothing to improve road safety, and lead to poor compliance with a possible negative effect on safety. BMF government relations executive Trevor Magnus said this is typical of the lack of democracy in the EU, treating citizens with contempt. I conclude that the entire proposal should be placed in the waste paper basket and recycled, but not into another wet blanket, please.

 Madam President, looking at the Commission’s programme for 2007, I am struck not just by the new areas in which the EU seeks to strip more power away from my country and from the ex-EU slaves and eunuchs who run it, but by the brief mention of the term ‘constitutional treaty’. My submission is that the hidden agenda and programme for 2007 will include a resurrection of the constitution, that slain vampire, after a small blood transfusion. The nationals of those countries who rejected it will be told to vote again because they did not understand that it was compulsory. The Commission hopes to obscure the principal issue, namely its quest for legal personality or EU sovereignty. Yet every year the EU takes more of the powers of nationhood. I object to the concept that British nationals are assumed to be in favour of all this power theft, without being allowed to vote on the subject. I also note a proposal from the Council to improve cooperation between EU police and security forces. This contains a proposal about sharing information at European level, including sharing with Europol. This has been questioned and resisted before. It is an infringement of the rights of British nationals, some of whom already have an EU criminal record for plane-spotting. My countrymen want an honest answer to the question of what the EU thinks it is and what happened to the concept of trade.

 Mr President, in his report Mr Elles says that it is essential for policymakers to focus on what the real challenges will be for the EU in the years ahead. When David Cameron was campaigning for the leadership of Mr Elles’ party last year, he told the Daily Telegraph
, ‘we must challenge the culture of the EU, leaving it to focus on its real job, making the single market work properly and championing free trade’. However, Mr Elles’ policy priorities include common foreign and security policy, the European Neighbourhood Policy, terrorist threats, border controls on immigration, environment and communication. This is the Tory hidden agenda and it is very different from the one Mr Cameron put forward when he needed the votes from the more Eurosceptic party members. But of course this is the same Mr Cameron who was pretending he would leave the PPE-DE. One year on, Mr Elles is free to carry on promoting the PPE-DE agenda. His real leader, Mr Poettering, is no doubt delighted.

In considering the issues raised in this report it is necessary to make clear that whilst I am opposed to intolerance I do think that the criticism of the new Polish Government is counterproductive and that it is up to the Poles to democratically resolve these issues. In addition it must be understood that Poland is a profoundly Catholic country and the people as a result will reflect their Catholic beliefs in exactly the same manner as Muslims reflect the Islamic view on homosexuality. It is rare that Parliament, if indeed ever, criticises Muslims for holding such views and it only reflects double standards if Catholics are to be treated differently.

 Mr President, these questions show the European social model in flashing lights. However, the European social model is a mishmash that pleases no one: a bit of free market here and a bit of welfare state there, mixed with a little green posturing. The EU dictates that one size fits all and, judging by the identical wording of these group questions, one size does appear to fit all. However, in the Independence and Democracy Group, we realise that one size will never fit all. I am free to say that my party, UKIP, can never support the Lisbon Strategy, because it is the failed strategy of a Commission that has no legal right to dictate economic policy to my country. It is for this reason that the EU can never impose a sustainable development strategy on Britain. There is, however, a PPE-DE one-sizing problem. Last September, David Cameron was quoted in the Daily Telegraph
 as ‘fighting to end the EU’s damaging social role’ and leaving it to focus on ‘making the single market work properly’. Yet we now have a Tory MEP, Mr Bowis, asking how the EU will enhance its social role in economic policy. No wonder Mr Cameron’s pledge to leave the PPE-DE Group has become such a huge joke. Or, as I always say, ‘EU must be joking’.

 Madam President, Mr Titley is a good man and this proposal is full of good intention. However, I am against it. I am against it because there are better uses for this level of public expense. The case for the project is overstated and I do not think it is financially credible. In the UK we have a traditional saying ‘necessity is the mother of invention’ and here we have the EU, mother of inefficiency, providing no necessity but forcing a new invention. I believe that you are all looking for new uses to justify the huge cost of the Galileo satellite project. What about the additional cost of this project both for the taxpayer and for the motorist? How many false alarms will this eCall system trigger? Will it divert the currently under-funded public services from real emergencies? Which expensive new service will it call? All this rings alarm bells for me. If you believe Britain wastes public money, multiply that inefficiency when considering EU projects like this. This project provokes the expression ‘EU ain’t seen nothing yet’ or even the Northern expression ‘Ee, did you call?’

 Mr President, the EU is charging vehicles again for roads already paid for by national taxes. The EU will maintain nothing, so this is a scam. Lorries and coaches will pay: scam 1, a daily charge of EUR 8; plus scam 2, an annual charge of up to EUR 1 400; plus scam 3, tolls based on distance travelled; plus scam 4, an urban mark-up of 25% under the Euro-vignette; plus scam 5, an estimated EUR 1 500 to change to a digital tachograph; plus scam 6, driver-specific photo licences – in short, ID cards; and scam 7, EUR 3.5 billion paid by EU citizens because each vehicle will be tracked by Galileo, described as the biggest, whitest elephant ever to become weightless. But will this reduce congestion and emissions? Should buses and coaches be the first category to be charged? The answer is no. 500 million Europeans travelled by coach in 2005, many of them elderly people. This legislation encourages smaller vehicles, creating greater congestion, emissions and expense. But emission-sensitive charging already exists: it is called fuel duty. Is that too simple for the EU? However, the cost of all this is really about EU taxation for a centralised Europe and funding a satellite, is it not? It has nothing to do with roads.

 Mr President, we have seen the proposed Constitution for Europe rejected by the French and Dutch people. The computer-implemented inventions and port services directives were also rejected. Despite these rejections, the drive towards harmonisation goes relentlessly onwards, even when it has nothing to do with trade or EU efficiency and is bad for citizens. So here it is, another second-class act, the Postal Directive. This is none of the EU’s business, and I advise the EU to stay out of it. The Postal Directive seeks to impose value added tax on postage at a time when letter writing is under great competition from e-mail. The UK does not want it! The British Post Office is now 371 years old, and it was the British in 1840 who brought out the first postage stamp, bearing the head of Queen Victoria. Now the EU wants to stamp its dead hand of inefficiency on it. A high watermark of philatelic interference, perforated only by ignorance of British tradition and a wish to kill letter writing stone dead. From Penny Black to EU attack in 166 years! Is this progress? In 2004 the Postmaster General stated categorically that the British Government did not want VAT on stamps. The Royal Mail told me this very week that it does not want it, as it would be bad for small businesses, charities and customers. The British people do not want it. They are already paying for the cost of the EU’s common agricultural policy. What would Stanley Gibbons have said from the Strand in London if he had still been alive? I suggest he would have published a book with pictures of MEPs who monkey with British postal traditions entitled ‘Stanley Stamps Gibbon Catalogue’. When UKIP vote on this report, it will vote in accordance with the wishes of UK citizens. I hope British MEPs stick up for Britain. The people will watch as Europhiles submit their nations to another excessive stamp of EU authority. Thank you, Mr President, and good luck to the interpreters!

We do so because the adoption of this report kills the deal brokered by Tony Blair in December. To us, a 63% increase in the UK's contribution to the EU is unacceptable. The surrender of £7 billion of our rebate is unacceptable. The current financial perspectives are a bad deal for Britain. If this report is accepted, we fall back on Article 272 of the Treaty and annual negotiations of the budget. Though we disagree strongly with the reasons behind this report, we are happy to play our part in re-opening a debate about how UK taxpayers' money is spent.

 Mr President, the Hampton Court meeting was to be the ‘social model’ summit. Then Mr Blair socialised – the same Mr Blair who strode into Brussels in July promising root and branch reform, but then pruned it down to the most invisible square root of a branch of any EU Presidency in memory. The comments after Hampton Court were from those amazed that nothing happened. In fact it should be labelled the Hampton Court ‘aMaze’. The ARD TV station in Germany said that, after four months, nothing happened – absolutely nothing. The Polish media called it one of the most bizarre EU summits. In Italy, La Repubblica
 just called it ‘embarrassed’ and ‘embarrassing’. Mr Blair claimed it debated the things the public wanted it to debate, but the public does not want European policies for universities when the EU has no competence in education. Nor does it want things like nine separate missions around the world as part of an EU defence policy. If Hampton Court proved anything, it was that vacuums are dangerous when filled with hot air from politicians. I propose that a blue metal plaque be placed on the wall at Hampton Court saying: ‘On this spot on 27 October 2005 nothing happened’ or, as they say in Yorkshire: ‘Eee, you must be jokin’’.

 Mr President, the recent Brok report argued that the EU as a whole should play a major role within the UN. The PPE-DE Group amendment to the report demanded that the EU should be guaranteed a seat in the UN Security Council. That word ‘guaranteed’ is incompatible with the UN High-level Panel’s view that no change in the composition of the Security Council should be regarded as permanent in the future. In both of the Panel’s proposed models for reform of the Security Council, the current permanent members would retain seats. That is not what the Eurofanatics want to hear. They want the EU to take over the seats of France and the UK. However, even Mr Brok’s report conceded that an increased role for the EU was pending the entry into force of the new Constitutional Treaty. The Constitution is dead; the EU has no legal personality; Europe is not a nation and the EU, therefore, has no place in the United Nations.

 Whilst we wish to commemorate the end of the second world war in Europe, this document amounts to a re-write of history, even stating in the title that World War 11 ended on 8th May 1945, which it did not as the world still faced Japan. The addition of propaganda that the EU is somehow involved in the subsequent peace is objectionable to me and to the seven members of my family who fought in that war against the Axis. I note that on the schedule this resolution was entitled ‘Future of Europe’ whereas the actual resolution is entitled ‘60th Anniversary of the end of the Second World War on 8 May 1945’. The EP should be specific when making resolutions. For the above reasons, I voted against this resolution.

 Mr President, this directive is causing alarm amongst hauliers in the UK. Drivers say that they will lose GBP 80 per week. The industry says that it will cost GBP 1 billion a year and cause a shortfall of 65 000 drivers, ramping up prices and knocking UK trade. The UK Government tells us it does not provide a UK view because it was felt to be ‘inappropriate’ given that the UK would be holding the presidency of the Council. Is this what we expect from the modern Labour Party, which rolls over to be tickled on the issues vital to the UK and all because it wants to suck up to the EU and look presidential? So heaven help our truckers! Does Labour represent them any more? ‘Inappropriate’ to give a UK view? Tell British truckers and businesses, because they will bear the cost. This report comes from the German perspective at the centre of Europe, ideally placed no matter which way they drive. However, a lorry from Birmingham takes much longer to reach the target. These proposals will cripple British ability to compete in Europe. EU supporters say it is all about road safety, but the EU is really all about money, power and control. These proposals will put a lucrative spy beaming up to Galileo in every trucker’s cab. Private vehicles will possibly be next. Look out truckers, because Big Barrot is watching you. So shout to him and say: ‘This will take my truck off the road!’ or, in short, ‘Truck off!’.

 Mr President, organic farming means nature governing food, but the EU wants a law of nature written in Brussels. The EU wishes to harmonise organic products and production, with more EU regulations and more EU snoopers. It is ‘straight banana’ time again! Organic products come in all shapes and sizes, but the EU cannot accept that. The EU believes that nothing should escape manic control. People are selling food in pounds and ounces. When they are caught they are treated as criminals. Why? Because this is EU control for the sake of it. The report praises the common agricultural policy, which was one of the worst EU mistakes ever. The CAP destroyed areas of British agriculture, and now the EU wants to destroy British organic agriculture. UKIP wants to see organic farming flourishing, not buried under tonnes of EU manure.

 Mr President, this part-session includes discussion of a directive stating that air controllers will have to speak and understand English to a satisfactory level in all Member States. English is already the language of air control. One of the entry requirements to train at Eurocontrol is a good knowledge of English, the international language of aviation. These proposals lessen the requirement to speak English across air traffic control. Amendment 17 says: ‘Member States may 
require level 5 of the ICAO proficiency test in English and/or the local language’. ‘Or’ means ‘or’ in any language. That threatens safety. The report contains phrases such as: ‘the right of Member States to develop national endorsements should only apply in exceptional cases’. That is not English, it is EU gobbledegook. World airlines fear the EU’s costly desire to switch air control from radar to Galileo, but the EU’s air control agenda is not really about airways, it is about EU control and control for the sake of it.

 Mr President, I sympathise with the people of Tibet. They lost their independence and cultural identity when columns of uninvited troops came over the border. Tibetans were forced to comply with foreign regulations aimed at changing their traditions and eliminating their country. I sympathise because the United Kingdom lost its independence and identity when a referendum on trade turned out to be a political take-over. Uninvited foreign regulations poured over the border attempting to change traditions and eliminate the country. I support the Tibetans in their peaceful struggle to leave the grip of China and hope that they will pray for the people of the UK in their struggle to leave the dead hand of the European Union. I respect the peaceful objectives of the Buddhist tradition of Tibet and realise that the rest of the world has much to learn from them. On Monday, the President told this Parliament that the First World War, a war in which both of my grandfathers defended their country, was a civil war. This is an untruth. I am aware that Tibet's proud history is also being rewritten by the same species of bureaucrat. If you do not learn from history, you are doomed to repeat it. I can only offer a little 1940's anglicised Latin in sympathy which I believe follows the Buddhist teachings, 'noli illegitimatum carborundum'

 Mr President, the report states that it is essential to create the new Europe on the basis of the creative cooperation of cultures. No it is not! Cultures and men are largely responsible for being the greatest repressors of women in Europe. And yet white, western liberal women – like those represented here – run scared of attacking the dangerous nonsense of multiculturalism and turn a blind eye to the way in which ethnic minority women in places like my constituency, for example, are abused; where women are repressed and treated as chattels of men; where they are not allowed to be educated; where they are not allowed to go to work; where they are not allowed to go outside; where they are ghettoised within the ghetto. Worse, they are genitally mutilated; they are told to cover their bodies; they are forced into marriages; they are the object of honour killings, which the police have testified in Derbyshire and the metropolitan area. If we are to give women full rights, they need to be liberated from cultures and from men. They need to be emancipated so that their lives can be equal and enriched and poverty can be eliminated. The question is, do the women here have the balls to carry out the job?

It will divide the English nation and undermine our nationality. Well, I have news for you: it will not work because the people in, for example, Derby, in the East Midlands, have no special affinity with the people of Lincolnshire. The regions are artificial. They are spurious. They have no identity. They will not work either because the English people do not want them. They voted against in the north-east by 90% in the one opportunity they had, and they will do so elsewhere. We English are very tolerant. We are prepared to subsidise the Welsh, the Scots and most of the nations here. We do it with resignation. We will not tolerate being robbed of our nationality and our identity.

 Madam President, my party cannot support the candidature of the President for the institution because we do not support the institution over which he desires to preside. My constituents do not doubt the authority or the legitimacy of this democratically elected Parliament, but they do not wish to be governed by it. They want to be governed by their own people in their own parliament – and they will be during the lifetime of this Parliament. Believe me. For the same reasons we – and they – do not wish to see the Constitution enacted because they see it as based on obsolete economic and political theories of the 1950s, of the fear of war and an outdated threat of communism. They see it as creating a Europe that is inward-looking, that is bureaucratic, that is restrictive, whereas we should be creating a Community that is innovative and outward-looking, that reaches out to the rest of the world, that is flexible and democratic. That is not the institution that we are creating here in Europe today and we wish to have no part of it. We will not support it. My constituents do not want to see the creation of a federal state called Europe. They want to be governed by their own people in their own parliament. They do not wish to give their destiny, their independence and their sovereignty to a group in Brussels, or indeed in Strasbourg. Some 20 years ago Mrs Thatcher went to Fontainebleau and said: 'I want our money back' – and she got some of it. We want our country back and, believe you me, we are going to get it.

 Madam President, the rapporteur was, I understand, the Director-General of Spain’s police between 2002 and 2004. This means, I assume, that one of his last tasks before leaving office was to deal with the immediate aftermath of the terrible bombings in Madrid. I, therefore, accept the sincerity with which he now puts the case for extending the powers of EUROPOL in order to deal with new terrorist threats. However, I will not need to remind him that my country, too, has had a long history of facing up to terrorism and, like his country, that consisted for many years of a threat from separatists, which, in recent years, has been matched by the new threat of Islamic extremism. What I am saying is that my country is very grateful for help and cooperation from its neighbours where necessary, but, in the final analysis, it must be able to act exactly according to its own methods and procedures and on its own initiative. But what is being proposed here is not just a further encroachment of EUROPOL into areas that should be left under the control of Member States. Worse still than that, the Commission wants to change the legal framework governing EUROPOL so that any extension of EUROPOL’s powers does not have to be ratified by Member States. The rapporteur concludes his statement by saying that we must ensure EUROPOL enjoys maximum democratic legitimacy. Once again, we see that the EU, as it seeks to take powers from Member States, even in matters of policing, has a very strange idea of democratic legitimacy.

 Mr President, on a point of order under Rule 171. Just now you told the House that 19 Members had sought to make speeches. Before lunch we were told that there were 14 Members. I know that when it comes to statistics, and particularly when there is no roll-call vote, things are a bit loose here, but could you explain the difference between those two figures?

 Mr President, poor Mr Frattini is still lost in the Hampton Court maze as we see the EU moving ever further from democracy. Let us contrast our position – and not for the first time – with Switzerland. Switzerland knows that local knowledge is the key to immigration policy. The EU seeks to centralise immigration control above the level of national governments. The Swiss, in contrast, devolve it downwards, wherever possible, to the level of their cantons. In Switzerland the annual quota for immigrants is partly decided by the Federal Government and partly by the cantons. Proposals for a federal migration agency have been rejected there. The Swiss cantons and their long tradition of direct democracy have been the historic drivers of an immigration policy which works to the benefit of the national economy and ensures that immigrants are well integrated into Swiss society. As Professor Windisch of the University of Geneva told the French Foundation for Political Innovation in its April 2006 newsletter, Swiss direct democracy had to – openly and very early on – confront issues involving immigration and integration by means – perish the thought! – of referendums and popular initiatives. He continued: ‘Unlike an extremely centralist country such as France, the debate was led both at the federal level and on a canton and commune scale, calling for community-based responses, and involved initiatives such as setting up an integration office in every canton and the geographic dispersion of new arrivals.’ The lesson for those of us who, unlike the Swiss, have not had the good fortune to stay outside the EU is this: immigration policy works in Switzerland because it is decided according to local needs as well as national ones and because local communities, not faceless, centralised bureaucracy, are responsible for the integration of migrants on the basis of those needs. In the UK, subject as it is temporarily to EU membership, immigration policy moves ever further away from that fount of local knowledge, and we in the UK Independence Party have been quick to point out the shortcomings of that approach.

 Madam President, this joint debate encompasses four reports supposedly compiled to outline better regulation in the EU. That is surely a contradiction in terms! Despite the many words written and spoken on this topic, the crux of this issue has been entirely overlooked. Mr Doorn’s report best sums up the blinkered stance taken towards this notion of better regulation. After all, that report states that the Commission’s action programme to reduce administrative burdens by 25% by 2012 ‘cannot [...] be equated to a deregulation, nor lead to a change in the policy objectives and level of ambition contained in Community legislation’. Therefore, not one single report considers the possibility that less regulation – or, even better, no legislation – is what is required. This concept will not be grasped by this talking shop simply because, if this logic were pursued, then Euroland would be forced to admit what we have known for many years, which is that the EU is bad news for business.

 Mr President, last week’s gem in this place was that Europol be given fresh powers to police Euroland whilst Europol itself was placed above the law. Even the Third Reich did not think of that one. This week is even better: an agency for fundamental rights has been conceived to ensure that Member States comply with the Charter. But this was contained in a failed EU Constitution. After all, France and Holland exercised their fundamental right to say ‘no’ to this and yet again you are trying to sneak large parts of the Constitution in through the back door. Mrs Gál even begins her statement by saying that the suspension of the Constitution-making process makes this the right moment to promote fundamental rights. Is that what you said? The Politburo would be pleased with that. In fact, if fundamental rights really meant anything in the EU, the democratic rejection of the Constitution would make this absolutely the wrong moment to bring forward such a proposal. There was I believe an old Glen Miller song beginning: ‘Sleepy time Gal, you’re turning night into day’. You may believe that you can turn ‘no’ into ‘yes’, but when the sleepy time voters wake up, they will soon throw this out.

 Mr President, last week the whole Parliament was treated to a very grand press release from Mr Adamos Adamou, MEP. Apparently the whole world should know that he, as Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, ‘calls upon the international community to provide protection for civilian lives in Gaza’. Well how, precisely? What is he going to do – stand in the middle of the street with a tin hat on his head? Fortunately, a Google news search shows that there has been no response to the suggestion at all. All I can suggest now – and there have been some very strong speeches made here – is that we take a check on reality. The tragic truth is this: if Hamas continues to bomb, to kill, to maim and now to kidnap, then Israel will respond. Those who are burying their heads in the sand had better recognise that, or more tragedy will ensue.

In considering the issues raised in this report it is necessary to make clear that whilst I am opposed to intolerance I do think that the criticism of the new Polish Government is counterproductive and that it is up to the Poles to democratically resolve these issues. In addition it must be understood that Poland is a profoundly Catholic country and the people as a result will reflect their Catholic beliefs in exactly the same manner as Muslims reflect the Islamic view on homosexuality. It is rare that Parliament, if indeed ever, criticises Muslims for holding such views and it only reflects double standards if Catholics are to be treated differently.

 Mr President, we are to have an extended period of reflection, are we? Some people who are having periods of reflection are otherwise known to be ‘in retreat’ and some retreats are made in better order than others. Some people, Mr Barroso, might have learned from reflection to date, saying that perhaps it was not the case, or that they might have done things differently, or even, perish the thought, that they were wrong. But all we have heard this morning is, ‘We were right. The people of France and Holland are wrong. The Constitution should be brought back’. You have employed new architects to build on exactly the same foundations of integration, over-regulation and empirical ambition. Fortunately, only three people in ten in Britain any longer believe any of this rubbish, so roll on our referendum, whatever the question! (Applause from the IND/DEM Group)

 Mr President, the UK Independence Party is probably going to be helpful for the first time ever, so it is nice to be able to make my one-minute speech. We have repeatedly condemned the Council for its lack of transparency. The remedy is very simple: to change the Council’s rules of procedure, as Mr Hammerstein Mintz makes clear in his report. Such a move would certainly ensure that in future the British people could see when British ministers renege on what they have pledged before entering such meetings. But that is not enough. The Commission will remain as the unelected government of the EU, formulating and dictating laws without any democratic mandate whatsoever. Meanwhile, this Parliament continues farcically pushing through vote after vote on dubious shows of hands. Above all, France and Holland’s democratic rejections of the failed EU Constitution are viewed with complete contempt by the Council, Commission and Parliament alike. So let us stop lecturing the rest of the world on democracy. Throw open the Council’s doors, and the Commission’s too.

 Mr President, first our misguided rapporteur welcomes the fact that the Commission strategy paper ‘advocates an outward-looking Union’. He does not really mean an outward-looking Union; what he means is an expansive Union and not, apparently, a period of reflection following the Dutch and the French referendums – not at all! They were saying ‘no’, particularly to Turkey. All we are getting here is more centralisation at the same time as more expansion to make an unworkable whole, and this in the very week that Germany has been told to get its economic house in order! Far from sending shiploads of money to Eastern Europe, they would do better to make sure that the prosperity of Europe as a whole is not compromised. It is fashionable at this time to pretend there is a long queue of countries wanting to join this place. The fact is that the Balkan countries have just left one bossy, bureaucratic, corrupt organisation called Yugoslavia, and do not wish to join an organisation with similar characteristics merely for the benefit of their health. The truth is that they want money. They want yet more money. What they should not be doing in the Balkan countries is trading their sovereignty as though it was a commodity, for that way lies great disappointment. I fear a great deal of disappointment lies ahead for them.

 Mr President-in-Office, so very wonderful was Mr Blair’s Presidency and his contribution to Euroscepticism that we had hoped for an encore of a further six months; but that was not to be. However, I can assure you that you are our second choice. We are very grateful to you for your thoughts that somehow the Constitution is not dead, but presumably merely sleeping. Presumably you think that it will be brought back to life at any time, which according to the press shocked even Mr Barroso from his extended period of reflection. So carry on as best you can! Never mind the fact that 70% of your own people in Austria do not approve of the way you have been talking this morning. Never mind that two-thirds of the British people cannot see any benefit in remaining part of this sham Parliament. Never mind about the ‘no’ vote in France; never mind about the ‘no’ vote in Holland. From your lofty position your disdain for democracy will be noticed and, I am sure, approved of in many sections of this Parliament. Meanwhile, on a more mundane level, this is becoming a very expensive club to belong to. Never mind that during the season of goodwill Mr Blair comes along and contributes so much money – GBP 7 billion – that his would-be successor now wishes to have a national patriotic ‘Britain Day’ day to try and undo the damage to the perception of the British people. We have a 63% increase in our budget over seven years, and the Working Time Directive is to be brought in, so we cannot even create that wealth. What a wonderful agenda! And to all those who came from Eastern Europe in the hope of getting money, I am sorry, but the cheque is not in the post!

 Mr President, this is not a Voggenhuber-Duff report, it is just a duff report. The question is, is the Constitution dead or is it just sleeping? If the answer to all this had been ‘yes’, there can be no doubt that the Commissioners would have had no difficulty in explaining what ‘yes’ meant. It is just us poor peasants who happen to believe in ‘no’ who now need to have it explained to us what ‘no’ means. ‘No’ in this case means sheer arrogance on the part of the Commission in presuming to go ahead with this project, when 70% of people in Austria do not want it to go ahead; when two-thirds of the population of Great Britain do not see any benefit in future membership of this sham Parliament; when the people of France have voted ‘no’; and when the people of Holland have voted ‘no’. What part of ‘no’ does the Commission not understand? ‘No’ means that large proportions of the population of Europe do not want to continue with this pretence. We thought we were joining a common market and it has grown and grown and grown like Topsy until this final report, which is pushing us towards full political union. Well, it will all fall apart, without any doubt, because that is not what people thought they were voting for.

 – Mr President, the choices facing Romania and Bulgaria are quite simple: will they compete with the economies of Western Europe on the basis of skills, or with Turkey on price? A practical example would be the steel industry. In Ireland, the state-owned Irish Steel was sold to Europe’s favourite steel producer Mr Mittal for one pound. Five years later, just weeks after he collapsed Irish Steel with debts of GBP 50 million and no word of complaint from the then Irish Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy, we had Mr Blair writing to the Romanian Prime Minister recommending Mittal as a suitable custodian of Romania’s steel industry. No doubt Mr Mittal’s donation to Mr Blair of GBP 125 000 was coincidental. The donations to Labour have continued, and again, coincidentally under the British Presidency, anti-dumping tariffs on steel produced by Mittal outside the EU have continued to be reduced by Commissioner Mandelson. But what will happen once Romania and Bulgaria are on the inside? They hope, of course, for an increase in their standard of living, but with that comes an increase in the costs of production. Just as Mittal moved production from Ireland to Romania, where will Romania’s production go in due course? Would it be Kazakhstan or Algeria, Serbia, Bosnia? All of these countries’ steel industries have been bought with aid from loans from the EBRD and the World Bank In other words, European taxpayers are subsidising the export of their own heavy industries. The sale of Sidex was seen to have helped Romania’s bid for EU membership. What will be the price for the next wave of candidate countries? Are the Romanian and Bulgarian governments happy to pay for EU membership with the jobs of their steel industries? What other industries have similar deals hidden away? If Mr Mittal is successful in his rumoured takeover of Corus/British Steel, no doubt they will follow MG Rover into Blair-sponsored oblivion. (Applause)

 Mr President, for those of us who are opposed to the whole idea of political union, the matter is quite straightforward. We are opposed to political union with Turkey just as we are opposed to political union with Germany, France or Italy. However, what is one to make suddenly of all these euro-fanatics – especially down there – and the CDU in Germany, and even the great President Chirac himself, whose ardour for the European Union's endless development suddenly cools when they reach the Bosphorus? Some this morning will detect the whiff of hypocrisy; but it is not actually hypocrisy, it is the smell of fear: fear that public support for the whole EU project will finally collapse if Turkish entry is seriously
 pursued. After all, the latest Eurobarometer, as Mr Poettering will surely know, showed 70% opposition to Turkish membership in France and 74% in Germany. But, as usual, Brussels will plough on. Good! Although we are against Turkish accession, we shall be quite happy to watch the EU destroy itself while trying to achieve it. They say turkeys do not vote for Christmas, but if the EU institutions vote for Turkey, it could be a serendipitous exception to the rule.

 Just five years ago, the EU set out to make itself a rival to the United States of America within ten years. Now we hear the half-time whistle, but I suspect Mr Barroso is not a man to listen to whistle-blowers. We are asked to consider a mid-term review, but there seems little to review. The unemployment rate is high and rising and 101 000 regulations and directives are bleeding the life out of the wealth creators. Growth is worse. Mrs Figueiredo said in her report yesterday that 22 million jobs need to be created in the EU in the next five years. You do not have to be Hayek to know that cannot be done. It is interesting to see the panic setting in amongst the federalists at last; the cracks are really showing. Mr Barroso is a rampant free marketeer, according to the people over there, while his ideas went out with the Ark according to Mr Mandelson, from the right. In Britain, at least, people are waking up. I quote from this morning’s Times
: ‘Peers tell Brussels to give back cash from EU budget’. We have paid in GBP 180 billion and got back GBP 105 billion. Where has the GBP 75 billion gone? Mr Barroso, you try and keep bleeding the British taxpayer at this rate, because worse is better and on that basis this corrupt institution is doing very well indeed.

 To my surprise, Mr President, I enjoyed Mr Barroso’s speech.

Mr Barroso, you also said the European Union will manage immigration and asylum policy. You said it is a European problem and therefore one best dealt with via a European approach. That was very helpful and will come as news to poor Michael Howard and the Conservatives in the British Parliament. It has to be said that your work programme has been shaped largely by the Commission’s annual policy strategy for 2005, which was published in February 2004 under the last
 Commission. It is Mr Prodi we should be questioning today about the Commission’s central policy objective of economic growth. He did not do very well, did he? What a travesty of democracy! We have the EU’s policies for 2005 dictated by a defunct Commission and approved by an expired Parliament. It is only the present Parliament that is sidelined. Do not worry, though, Mr Barroso, your luck is in: very few MEPs will even notice. The UK Independence Party, however, is very grateful to you because, as we are wont to say, ‘worse is better’!

 Mr President, Mr Juncker's speech was made with all the passion that a civil servant is likely to raise. Mr Juncker, you say that the Stability and Growth Pact will be your top priority, but your past statements serve to illustrate only the inconsistencies. Whilst I acknowledge that you played a key role in negotiating the pact's original rules, you recently said that the credibility of the pact had been buried and that the pact was dead. Is that still your opinion? You also said that you have a window of opportunity to cut a quick deal on the EU budget, including the British rebate of some EUR 4 billion a year. Is that so, Mr Juncker? The rebate took five years
 to negotiate. If your comments are true and you can cut a deal by June, then Mr Blair must have agreed in principle to surrender the rebate. Is that the case? With whom in the British Government precisely are you negotiating? Will the British electorate know about this at the time of the British general election, probably in May? Finally, the UK Independence Party, and in particular my colleague Mr Farage, has drawn attention to the criminal activities of more than one Commissioner.

You will be aware that your employees assaulted two of our employees – that is, employees of the United Kingdom Independence Party – this morning, causing bodily injury. I would like to ask whether this happened as a result of your instructions and whether or not you are prepared to take responsibility for this? I appreciate that you are not the President of Parliament, who has always proved partial. At Westminster, the Speaker's job is to protect the rights of backbenchers. All that the President of this Parliament – who is totally inexperienced – seems to do is to want to preserve the status quo. This morning he has really blotted his copy book because, last month, he permitted all the signs saying 'Yes to Turkey' to remain up in this Chamber for a considerable period of time. He set a precedent then, so why were we not permitted this very day to hold up signs saying 'Say no'? …
 Knapman (IND/DEM

 Mr President, please would you look at Rule 166 and tell me whether you have applied this Rule in response to the points of order, following your decision to tell your staff to assault ours, causing them bodily injury. The Rule stipulates that 'A Member may be allowed to speak to draw the attention of the President to any failure to respect Parliament's Rules of Procedure'. We have done that. 'A request to raise a point of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak'. We have done that – at least, for once, you got something right! Paragraph 4 states that 'The President shall take an immediate decision on points of order'. We ask you

 Mr President, nothing could show Mr Barroso's contempt for this Parliament more than the fact that he could only attend this debate for a few minutes before disappearing. On the subject of Ukraine, after the way in which he pushed through the election of his criminals and Commissioners, let us stop pretending that we can in any way lecture Ukraine on democracy. With regard to Turkey, we will not be supporting its membership application, just as we did not in the last Parliament, on the grounds of both cost and likely migration patterns. Had anybody in authority been here, I would have asked for confirmation that the cost could be in the order of GBP 19 billion or EUR 28 million. This means that Turkey is costing us as much as the ten countries that acceded to this Union this year. Could we please know what the cost will be, because for the first time you are hearing from a nation that is actually paying for it. Although the Labour Party in Britain wants to put GBP 5 billion towards it, the Conservative Party believes that GBP 5 billion is a good price to pay and believes you can still have tax cuts. Presumably it also thinks that pigs can fly. Can we actually have confirmation of the cost of 19 billion? Also, will some EUR 700 million be spent on around 60 diverse training projects in Turkey? Is that the true cost, or is there a more up-to-date figure? We know that Turkey's population growth rate remains phenomenal and that it has serious economic problems, including 70 per cent inflation. Seventy per cent inflation during the passage of the Maastricht Treaty would have caused some raising of eyebrows, but it is just a political project here, is it not? Especially for those who do not pay. We also know that human rights concerns are widespread. On that basis I would say, on behalf of the UK Independence Party, that we will offer Turkey friendship and free trade, but we will not offer the country political union – especially with the corruption and fraud that are endemic in this place.

 Mr President, Parliament will be pleased to know that the UK Independence Party were the lead players in the recent 'No' to the North-East Regional Assembly campaign in Britain. Seventy-three per cent of people in that region said they did not want any more Euro-bureaucracy. I wonder what percentage would vote to get rid of the already-existing regional assemblies, with their awful appointees and their corrupt practices? We will shortly have the opportunity to say 'No' to the EU Constitution and I mean any European Constitution, because the gap between Euro-rhetoric and reality has never been wider. The pretence here is that there will be no further integration until there has been a referendum. The reality is that the referendum is being pushed ever more backwards, while integration is being speeded up, with, for example, a common visa policy by 2006 and a European evidence warrant by 2005. I could produce 25 other examples, the most important being the common asylum system, which will be introduced in 2005, with coordination in place by the end of that year. All these things will be in place before a referendum takes place. As Members of this Parliament we are therefore entitled to ask what the effect will be of a nation saying 'No' in a referendum. Does it mean we will remain members of the Fourth Reich? Does it mean we will just be associate members, or will we be out? In particular, does it mean that any prior legislation will perish? We need assurance on this point. In fact, Europe cannot tell us what 'No' means. Britain will vote 'No' in the referendum by a massive majority, and will show you what 'No' means.

Mr President, in his first statement in July, Mr Barroso said that we have to choose one priority, and that priority must be employment. This does not seem to have transmitted itself to this particular committee, which recommends upgrading EU-India relations by outsourcing and insourcing. I am sorry the rapporteur did not have the time to tell us how much insourcing there has been, but there has been a great deal of outsourcing. In Britain alone, most of the banks, the insurance companies and even the National Health Service have outsourced. My point concerns 3SE, which was set up by the EU and the Indian Government. On its website it goes a little further. According to the website, the value of outsourcing is in increased working days. It invites employers to harness the time difference of three-and-a-half to five-and-a-half hours to pack in more
 hours. So there are no Commission hang-ups then about the working-time directive, as long it is the poor exploited workers of India who are involved! The rapporteur tells us that we must help Delhi fight against poverty, but would he just tell his own organisation what it is doing to help? Mr Barroso, as I said at the outset, says that he wants to boost employment in the EU. This report does just the opposite.

She understood the solution was small government, individual freedoms and national self-determination. Today the EU imposes big government, increasing central control and the erosion of the nation state. I can also remember her saying ‘no’, ‘no’, ‘no’, words the EU ignores or does not understand. She went on to make that now famous speech in Bruges that sparked opposition to the project. The EU is a 50-year-old attempted answer to a 200–year–old problem. I maintain if the EU was the answer, it must have been a very silly question. And, as they say in Star Wars, may the fourth be with you.

− As a fervent opponent of the EU and its continual meddling in our lives, I have consistently voted against the vast majority of reports that I have been asked to consider. As is inevitable, a report will come along that simply demands a different approach and I believe that the Auken report is one. I have been approached by many expats, all of whom did everything they could to establish a proper, legal and sustainable life in Spain. That they became victims of a clash of bureaucracies is now a matter of history and hopefully this report will compel an equitable solution. My action here does not imply a softening of my attitude to the EU and its impenetrable, inflexible and unaccountable structure. However, if subordinate bureaucracies will not solve the problems they themselves create, then a solution must be found. I hope now that the myriad problems created by the various Spanish authorities will be addressed and that such will be promptly resolved in the best interests of my constituents. I have a nagging worry that such intervention may not be the solution. In the land of the EU, the only continuing law is that of the unintended consequence.

 I abstained on the roll-call vote on paragraph 62 because I believe that every country – which the EU is not – should ensure that legislation on female genital mutilation is locally originated and applied. An international agreement would be more appropriate and far-sighted. As it is, the EU has no current competence in health matters, nor should it seek them. I also abstained on the vote on paragraph 72 because I am concerned about the implications on free speech. Although to be deplored, discriminatory comments do not necessarily fuel ‘hatred and violence’. That we are asked to agree to this will mean that those who choose can use this as evidence of such. My decision to abstain on Amendment 54 is based upon opposing the EU’s Free Movement of People and the principle of mutual recognition, and not in any way a reflection on my views regarding same-sex partnerships, which I agree should enjoy the same rights as others.

It is better from my point of view, because the sooner people realise just how damaging the EU is to their incomes, their livelihoods and food production, then we will be better off out – and that is what I stand for. This report takes no cognisance of hazard or risk; it cannot identify between the two of them. Let me tell you now. It is icy out there – that is a hazard. There is a risk I will fall over when I walk home. You can legislate for neither of them. It will damage food production. It will put farmers out of business.

 Mr President, the overall objective of the European Year 2009 is ‘to promote creativity for all as a driver for innovation and as a key factor for the development of personal, occupational, entrepreneurial and social competences through lifelong learning’. But we are always talking of new legislation. An oppugnant state mired in legislation and bureaucracy stifles creativity and entrepreneurship among its people. Belgium, for example, is unlikely ever to produce a Joe Meek or a Richard Branson, and, let’s be honest: the Singing Nun was never really on a par with The Beatles or the Rolling Stones. As the Commission sinks into caducity before becoming lost in caliginosity, the great works of European culture will remain as knitted beacons. Let us not stifle our artistes with any more legislation, and, as the great Ral Donner once lamented: ‘You don’t know what you’ve got until you lose it, uh-huh, oh yeah!’

 Mr President, it will not surprise you, but I do not welcome the conclusions of this report. The fact that it declares ‘sport is rightly subject to the application of the acquis communautaire’ flies in the face of all current evidence. It ignores the most public lament of sports bodies throughout Europe: that the Bosman and Kolpak rulings have left then unable to foster the development of home-grown sports talent. As a direct result, national teams are underperforming on the international stage. Even the president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, believes the rules need to be changed. But if sports bodies thought the current situation was bad, the Lisbon Treaty is going to make things even worse by providing the Commission with the treaty heading it requires to start interfering – I am sorry, legislating – over sport directly. The UK Government’s refusal to honour its promise to hold a referendum on the Treaty means we do not have the opportunity to save sport in the UK from the impending doom of Commission interference. Perhaps the vote in Ireland will save us all.

 Madam President, Europe has a rich and diverse cultural heritage and one which enriches our lives, not just aesthetically but economically. The sector contributes 2.6% of the EU’s GDP, as has been said. It shows higher growth than the economy in general and over five million people are employed in it. These are three very clear reasons why the Commission should keep its hands well away, unless we want to see culture go the same way as fishing and agriculture. However, the trading deficit in motion pictures alone between the EU and the United States grows year on year as European audiences choose American, rather than European, products. That deficit, according to the latest figures, was GBP 7.2 billion in one year alone. Free from the restraint placed on them by reliance on state funding, the six major US motion picture companies turned over USD 42.6 billion in 2006, whilst, according to a report by the European Audiovisual Observatory, the overall situation of the European film industry is deteriorating. That is because subsidies and legislation do not inspire artists – they breed bureaucrats and parasites.

 Madam President, discards are just one aspect of the nightmare that is the CFP. The EU, through its ill thought-out policy, is destroying livelihoods in developing nations across the world. The export of fish is significantly more important to the developing world in trade terms than other commodities such as rice, coffee and tea. Mauritania, for example, is dependent on its fishing industry for half of its exports, which represent 15% of its GDP. But, having devastated Mauritanian waters, the Commission now wants to dump its deal. It does not think that these now sterile waters are worth EUR 86 million a year. This denunciation of a fisheries agreement is supposed to be a secret; well, it was until now. I think African people should know about the EU’s shabby and dishonourable plans. It is colonialism at its most vicious, and I accuse these institutions of racism and exploitation of vulnerable societies. President Barroso’s non-imperial empire is not as benign as he would have us believe, so, if you want to move forward, discard Giscard and dump the Lisbon Treaty as well as the CFP.

 Mr President, lifelong learning is something the UK has always excelled at. Our Open University was the first establishment of its kind in the world, founded in the 1960s and based on a concept dating from the 1920s. Hundreds of thousands of so-called ‘mature students’ have graduated from the Open University, many of them graduates returning to their studies. Therefore I think the UK is fine when it comes to lifelong learning and, with respect, I do not think we need to accept any more interference from this place in education, which is still a national competence. However, just making it available is never enough for this place. The next step, of course, is compulsion. After all, what is the point of providing something that is not used? But, then, you do have a history in this area of billions of euros and other currencies wasted by EU institutions, and nation states blithely following orders is par for the course. But bringing this closer to home – specifically to bureaucrats and politicians in this House – it is now obvious to me that no matter how long you live, you simply do not learn! You do not even want to listen. You just carry on with the projects and to hell with anyone who might not agree or have a different point of view. I am reminded of the old saying, attributed to Sun Tzu but famously used by Kennedy: those who make peaceful protest impossible make violent protest inevitable.

I voted against Amendment 25 because, while the UK is still a member of the EU, the number of MEPs representing the UK should not be reduced at all. Therefore, to vote in favour of 74 MEPs would have been to vote for a reduction of four. Under the proposed principle of ‘degressive proportionality’, which is yet to be defined, small countries and microstates would be disproportionately represented while larger states, such as the UK, would be under-represented. Considering that large numbers of the population of Eastern Europe have migrated to the UK since 2004, and that they are currently entitled to vote in European Parliamentary elections, the number of UK MEPs should at least remain at its current 78, if not be increased.

 Mr President, the British Library has roots going back to 1753. It contains documents dating as far back as 300 bc. Famous people such as Karl Marx, Oscar Wilde, Mahatma Gandhi, Rudyard Kipling, George Orwell, George Bernard Shaw, even Vladimir Lenin, are just some of the figures who have studied in the reading rooms of the British Museum and British libraries. I wonder if they would have found so much inspiration from surfing the internet. I suspect that our magnificent facility, with its unprecedented collection of publications from every corner of the world and British Empire – and beyond, indeed – will be as treasured long after the EU has gone the way of other Eurofederalist projects from Charlemagne to the awful political nightmares of the last two centuries. Good luck, Ms Descamps, with your digital library, but in this area, as in so many others, I would rather concentrate on protecting and preserving and developing a heritage that I am proud of than creating the trappings of a new state out of the ruins of failed ones.

 Madam President, when the EU talks of a common foreign policy on energy, you need to be very aware of exactly who you propose to do business with. President Putin is on record as saying ‘The Commission should be under no illusions. If it wants to buy Russian gas, it has to deal with the Russian state.’ Gazprom is not a private company. It is a state-controlled tool of Russian foreign policy. It is, moreover, in the hands of President Putin’s political henchmen and, allegedly, organised crime. Take, for example, Alisher Usmanov. This gentleman, the son of a Communist apparatchik, is Chairman of Gazprom Invest Holdings, the group that handles Gazprom’s business activities outside Russia. He is the man we are doing business with. He is the man who cuts off gas supplies if client states dare to question Gazprom’s demands. Allegedly a gangster and racketeer, he served a six-year jail sentence in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, his eventual pardon coming at the behest of Uzbek mafia chief and heroin overlord Gafur Rakhimov, described as Usmanov’s mentor. Usmanov bought the newspaper Kommersant
. Three months later the journalist Ivan Safronov, a critic of the Putin regime who just weeks earlier had been vigorously interrogated by the FSB, as the KGB is now called, mysteriously fell to his death from his apartment window, still clutching a recently purchased bag of shopping. According to Craig Murray, the former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, it was Usmanov who ordered the cutting off of supplies to Georgia earlier this year. Please take note, Madam President, the Kremlin has now refused to sanction the construction of a pipeline to the EU over Georgian territory. These are the people you want to do business with. These are the people around whom you want to mould your foreign policy on energy. Commissioner, good luck. You will need it.

 Madam President, it is not often that a member of the UK Independence Party congratulates a rapporteur in this House. In this case I will make a rare exception. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations has estimated that the catch of 70% of fish species on this planet has already reached or exceeded maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The common fisheries policy, with the disgraceful problem of discards that results from it, has made a major contribution to what is potentially a grave ecological disaster, especially in the North Sea. In the 1980s, the Canadian Government was warned by fishermen that cod was being dangerously overfished. The Government ignored the warnings and, by 1992, the cod fishery totally collapsed. A similar situation now seems to be evolving in European waters. The rapporteur refers to deficient analysis and inadequate solutions offered by the Commission’s communication, which she goes on to describe as simplistic. The Commission has recently been criticised for the way it gathers and interprets statistics on maritime issues. In a recent briefing, the British Government refers to ‘an absence of necessary data on what the appropriate targets should be’. The Commission’s interpretation of MSY is based on outdated models and dogmatic ecological concepts. It clearly demonstrates the desire to gain further competences at any cost. The loss of our fishing stocks is too high a price to pay, and I thank the rapporteur for being honest in her condemnation of the Commission’s communication. It surely says something when the Europhile PPE-DE Group is echoing the UKIP line. But then, everyone gets there sooner or later!

 Mr President, the Belgian Government recently passed a law requiring supermarkets to charge customers for plastic bags. I commend it on this action. It is a step on the way to a better environment. A similar law was passed in Ireland some years ago and it was also very successful, reducing carrier bag usage by up to 90%. This shows how Member States, when left to handle their own affairs and without EU interference, can solve their problems quite well by themselves. But I note that the supermarket in Parliament’s basement in Brussels is not charging for carrier bags. I have written to the manager of the supermarket asking why this law should not be applied in his shop. But perhaps this is another example of one law for ordinary folk and another law that is ignored for a privileged few.

 Mr President, as you might expect, there are many areas of concern to me in this report but sadly I have time only to look at one. In her report, Mrs Gibault proposes a pilot scheme of registration cards for artists. Could this be the thin end of yet another wedge? Will this then be rolled out to apply to all professions and trades? Will we all then require a card before taking up employment? Could you then be prevented from taking employment in your chosen field, as is the case with photographers from other countries in Germany, unless you have a permit? And who will organise this, pray? More bureaucrats? Just as over-regulation stifles business, so this proposal will suffocate art. Indeed it will ensure continued foreign dominance in the fields of art and entertainment largely from the United States.

 Mr President, here we see one of the few cases where this Parliament is asked for real legislative input as part of a codecision procedure. Mrs Jackson has duly compiled the report but, not content with that, Parliament throws in Mr Blokland’s report as well, an own-initiative report with no legislative relevance, and the subject – waste! How much paper was wasted printing this report? However, at least it gives me the chance to point out the difference between UKIP and British Conservatives. As a UKIP MEP, I can stand up for my country even when I have to disagree with a group colleague to do so. I believe my own country is capable and responsible in matters of waste and should be free to enforce its own legislation. The British Tories are not free to criticise EU enthusiasts within their own group, the EPP – the group their leader promised to leave. That is bad enough. But, worse still, they even write the EPP’s Europhile reports for them. Witness Mrs Jackson when she says you must absolutely resist the Member States and the Commission in their efforts to keep the comitology process closed. Naturally, I am with her as far as the Commission goes, but the Member States? A British Tory talking about resolutely resisting the Member States? This is the true face of British Conservatives.

 Madam President, the Commission and the rapporteur intended a slight liberalisation of advertising law. However, I believe it has been hijacked by extremists. Here are some of the most damaging elements. A ban on advertising during children’s programmes means there will be fewer of them and the remainder will be of lower quality. Jobs will be lost in the media and the toy industry. The ban also extends to news, documentaries, advisory programmes, theatre, opera, any form of sponsorship and product placement. The consequence will be to reduce revenue to the commercial media, bringing their very future into doubt. The right to short reporting – 90 seconds of someone else’s broadcast for free – will destroy commercial news and sports reporting. As you will see, I only have 90 seconds here. The ban on some foods would be better addressed by working with the food industry to improve its products and safeguard jobs, rather than blaming the advertising industry for something it does not control. A ban on advertising alcohol will not stop people drinking. Prohibition did not stop it in the USA. The directive seeks to use the country-of-origin principle to solve differences between Member States, yet it undermines that very principle. It will not work. I have time here for one example. Many Swedish media companies have been based in Britain to enjoy our employment laws. They are subject to British law, but they broadcast into Sweden. Sweden has more stringent child protection laws than the UK. It is justifiably unhappy. The IND/DEM Group and UKIP back Sweden’s right to decide what happens on Swedish territory and equally Britain’s rights on UK soil. The directive offers no solution, only an ongoing problem. I have introduced amendments to reject the Commission proposal. Moderate Members will support this.

 Mr President, the EU communication policy that this report evaluates was devised in an attempt to – and I quote – ‘halt the rise of euroscepticism’. It is yet another reaction to the French and Dutch public rejecting unequivocally both the draft Constitutional Treaty and further integration. Instead of accepting that ‘no’ means ‘no’, the political elite have deluded themselves that the French and Dutch people did not base their ‘no’ votes on sensible and educated grounds. Indeed, a Commission official is recently quoted as saying: ‘given the recent experience in France and the Netherlands concerning referendums, we would not advise anyone to organise one’. So asking people what they want is a no-no. May I offer you some advice? You are in a hole of your own making. I suggest you stop digging. You should throw away the spade. Why? Very simply, because you are missing the point. It does not matter how much style and gloss you put on a project, because if the substance is rotten then it will fail. For communication to be successful you have to listen. Simply shouting louder will not do! The institutions are being disingenuous to the people they purport to represent. The French and Dutch have scuppered the project, yet you go on as if this never happened. Let me assure you that if and when the British people are afforded the same opportunity, the results will be even more conclusive, and that no communication policy will change the growing realisation that, right across the Member States, the EU project is an expensive failure.

 Mr President, this proposal has been another plank in the attempts to impose EU ideals and censorship on an unsuspecting public. It is less about support to industries in the EU, and more about protecting them from outside competition in the real world. I have to ask: why is this proposal necessary? Well, maybe because in implementing such a programme the EU can exploit yet another area where its message can be delivered to folk who will not believe or contemplate that they are being manipulated. I quote: ‘It is to be recalled that (...) the programme MEDIA has now clearer references to the importance of European cinema for intercultural dialogue’. But it wholly ignores the bigger intercultural dialogue between the different European cultures and those of the wider world, for instance that of the Indian subcontinent. Not only that, but each and every aspect of this report duly sets out another attempt to interfere with commercial activity. We are told that the programme will cost EUR 671 million. We also know that he who pays the piper calls the tune. But where is the added value? Who benefits? It ignores what folk might want to see, given freedom of choice. However, the EU will benefit by distorting the marketplace in the minds of citizens. Ah yes, EU citizens, those poor folk who had citizenship forced upon them, from which there is as yet no escape!

 Mr President, last year Parliament rejected by 684 votes to 14 an attempt to impose patents on software, because, like books and all written materials, software is best described as ‘ideas in symbolic form’ and should continue to be subject only to copyright. Parliament was also persuaded that patenting software would stifle invention, cripple small businesses and harm the economy, and yet this year the Commission returns with an even more sweeping proposal, which would permit software to be patented. The proposal is for a single patent court, whose judiciary would be appointed by the same board as that which appoints judges to the present appeals court of the existing – purely advisory – European Patent Office. The Commission has a seat on the Board and, under this proposal, would acquire voting rights as well. This raises serious doubts about the independence of the new court, especially when we consider that the EPO has no scruples about issuing patents for software and that this proposal commits a single patent court to following the precedents set by previous EPO decisions. By the proposal’s own admission, litigation in this new court will be two to three times more costly than litigation in national patent courts, which this proposal will also abolish, thus putting appeal to this court beyond the reach of all but large corporations. I thought the computer-implemented inventions directive was bad until I saw this proposal. If it goes through, I shall gladly take the Leninist view that worse is better. Nevertheless, we should say no again and ask the Commissioners what part of no they do not understand.

Mr Beazley is a former teacher and MP and cannot be unaware that the United Kingdom Education Act 1996, brought in by his own party, forbids the promotion of partisan political views in schools in the United Kingdom. The EU is a political project – a project which has failed to persuade millions of adults, as shown by the results of the French and Dutch referendums last year. Having failed at that level, Mr Beazley now wants to try persuading our children of the benefits of the EU instead. I am reminded of a quotation: ‘Give me a child at the age of seven, and he is mine for life’. This, like so much else from this Committee, is sheer one-sided propaganda, and I will not tolerate or support it.

 Mr President, I have not met many people who are not in favour of the protection of natural, architectural or cultural heritage. Indeed, much of my constituency, the East of England, fits the bill as a rural area. That is, of course, as long as some of the misguided, unsustainable development plans from Mr John Prescott, our Deputy Prime Minister, can be halted. Great Britain is an island with its own extensive natural and architectural heritage. However, although at face value this report has noble intentions, it serves to threaten Britain’s heritage. The proposals in the report have the specific aim of subsuming Britain’s distinct and diverse culture into the federalist fairytale creation of a common European culture. Sadly, many MEPs see culture purely as a tool for promoting European integration and pursuing a delusional project called ‘a United States of Europe’. Why can people here not understand that there is so such thing as a common European culture, no common history and no common heritage, just as there is no common architecture or common language? Europe is a continent formed of unique nation-states with very different histories and heritage. That is what makes Europe so very interesting and attractive. The only way to achieve this report’s declared ambition of convincing Europe’s citizens that they share the same culture would be through lies. That is what frightens me. Today’s political elite seems to have no qualms about such deception. We have seen successive British governments seemingly deliberately and successfully keeping the British public in the dark about ‘project Europe’. What must be recognised is that the European Union’s integration agenda is one of the greatest threats to the heritage of every country in Europe that we have seen for decades. Sadly, reports such as these cannot see their own great contradiction.

 Mr President, it is said that the EU project has no greater ambition than to see the destruction of nation states and to have unwanted and unrealistic federal fantasies imposed upon them. There is an EU programme called Interreg – detailed in the British press today – which demands the setting-up of ‘transnational regions’. These include parts of Europe that are not even part of the EU: the southern part of Norway is in one such region; northern Norway and Iceland is another. Perhaps this is one reason why Iceland has decided not to even think about joining the EU for many years to come. My question is, who asked the bureaucrats to spend time considering such stupidity? You will be distressed, however, that these crazy folk have fallen foul of the law of unintended consequences. They have hastened the day when Britain says goodbye, for, as Winston Churchill once said, ‘Up with this we will not put’.

 Mr President, in the wine trade I would be described as an amateur du vin
. In layman’s terms, that means I can tell my claret from my hock. Indeed, I have taken exams under the UK’s Wine and Spirit Education Trust scheme and have reached the level just below Master of Wine, so perhaps I speak with a little authority here. The British market is unusual inside the EU in that it has been growing at a dramatic rate for many years. However, we are eschewing wines from the EU in favour of wines from around the world, in particular Australia and California. Why should this be, you ask? Could it simply be that they make wine that suits the customer’s palate? Producers in these and other New World countries are not bound by pettifogging bureaucracy that tells them which grapes to grow where and then how to make the wines. They produce unsubsidised wines that people want to buy, at a price they can afford. But there is another factor in play and that is product information. Consider this situation: you are in a supermarket looking at hundreds of bottles of wine. You pick up a bottle – like this elegant Pomerol, for example – and try to find out something about it. Not everybody carries Sotheby’s Wine Encyclopaedia around with them. Why should they? They look to the bottle for information. The Pomerol is sadly lacking in information. However, this bottle of wine from California tells you more about wine on a label three inches square – that is 10 cm – than most people will ever need to know, including the fact that it was matured in American oak for 12 months. Gaining and keeping customers is what business is all about. Creating more rules for EU producers to abide by will cripple them and their industry and no amount of subsidy will save them.

 Mr President, I quote from a recent article in the British Press: ‘Britain’s booming wine industry will be scuppered by EU regulations that want to prohibit growers in Britain, all of them unsubsidised, from planting any more vines if their sales continue to soar’. Growers – many of them in my region – have been calling on the Commission to increase the threshold or scrap it altogether. Just what is it about English wine that becomes so intimidating? Is it that when tasted blind with French wines and others, English wines come out on top for taste, thus our competitors are simply jealous? Or is it because there are regions in other EU countries producing hugely subsidised grapes that will never produce decent wine? Or is it just that when the EU sees something successful, it has to interfere, regulate and destroy it? Can you wonder why more and more folk want nothing to do with the EU when it destroys their livelihoods?

 Mr President, each village and town in England has a line around it for planning purposes, stating that it is a defined village or town settlement. However, we are now witnessing the erosion of the traditional communities and destruction of our landscape due to the total disregard for sensible and locally acceptable planning developments. You might ask who is responsible for this. Have a guess: the regional assemblies accountable directly to Brussels. Is this surprising? Not at all, when you consider that planning applications and projects are no longer discussed with the people that they affect. To protect England’s precious greenbelt land and to end overdevelopment and towns merging, we have to abolish these unwanted and undemocratic assemblies and return planning issues to where they have been dealt with traditionally: town halls. Then, and only then, will our greenbelt land be given the protection and respect it deserves.

 Mr President, this is just another piece of legislation that seeks to increase the authority of the EU over Member States. We already have Directive 2002/46/EC, which requires safe upper levels for food supplements. However, those limits have not yet been published. A better example of EU incompetence would be hard to find. Despite this, the EU juggernaut carries on with its overbearing legislation, which only serves to destroy small businesses and removes freedom of choice from the consumer. The UK has had enough of this misinformed interference. At present there is Private Members’ Bill going through Westminster, calling for the UK to be freed from the directive I mentioned relating to food supplements. I hope it succeeds and thus sets a precedent that is the beginning of the end in the UK for the authority of these damaging and unnecessary regulations. That would be a significant step towards the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.

 Mr President, multilingualism is something that should be encouraged and developed. Communication is a necessary and powerful tool. However, despite what the EU and many other charlatans wish to pretend, Britain uniquely is a global trading nation of considerable status. Thus the languages that should be appearing on the national curriculum – let me emphasise ‘national’ curriculum – should be those of the large and rapidly expanding economies of the world, which, in the case of Brazil, is an EU language: Portuguese. But the teaching of Mandarin or Cantonese Chinese, Arabic, Hindi and Russian would serve European countries far better than the insular concentration simply on EU languages. The suggested European Indicator of Competence has its focus only on EU languages. This ignores the real world and illustrates the typical short-sightedness of the EU. It cannot be denied that part of the motivation for the Commission’s interest in this is that many, Mr Chirac included, resent the fact that the lingua franca of business throughout the world, and indeed the European Union, is English. People are becoming defensive about the potential erosion of their languages. However, the principal reason why the Commission is championing linguistic diversity is not any deep-seated fear that languages and cultures are being eroded, but the knowledge that their ultimate objective, a European federal superstate, is not possible until people can move only to be employable where the jobs are available. The content and organisation of national education systems is an area in which the EU, in theory, has no jurisdiction, and this report highlights why. Member States have different priorities, different trading links and traditions, despite the EU’s detrimental attempts to change these. It is for this very reason that any attempt at harmonisational convergence throughout the EU should be opposed. The proposed Indicator offers no tangible benefits to a global trading nation, simply one of the many tools to pursue the dreadful objective of a federal Europe.

 Mr President, I would like to bring to public attention another example of the European Union’s hypocrisy when it comes to addressing environmental matters. It is reported in today’s Moscow News
 that the publicly funded European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is poised to support the highly controversial Sakhalin II project. This proposal to extract oil from the continental shelf off the Russian island of Sakhalin threatens not only the economy and way of life of the island’s inhabitants, but also poses a potential environmental disaster of alarming proportions. Local fishermen and international environmental groups are pleading with the EBRD not to grant a loan of approximately EUR 300 million to finance the project. Now we see the EU in its true colours, which are by no means green. Both the European Community and the European Investment Bank are shareholders in a bank that proposes to finance a project which will have exactly the opposite effect to protecting the environment. This is hypocrisy in its saddest form.

 Mr President, I should like to conduct a little experiment. I ask people in the Chamber to remove their headphones for three seconds. One, two, three. What did you hear? Absolutely nothing! That is the sound of silence that heralds the clamour for this piece of legislation. Are there demands to do something? No! Will it address the fundamental concerns of 450 million people struggling to earn a living or find solutions to everyday problems? No, again. It is well known that something that you give but which cannot be disposed of has little value to the receivers since they have made no effort to get it. How cheap then is European citizenship, which is forced on people, is unwanted and cannot be refused or renounced. So here we go again! Another huge propaganda project to distort and hide the truth. The hope and belief seems to be that this will cure the scepticism that is growing across the continent. Low Euro-election turnouts, vocal opposition to enlargement and the rejected Constitution are all, apparently, to be remedied by throwing EUR 235 million at projects to persuade the people that the EU is actually doing something good for them. This is pay-as-you-go citizenship. The price rises as your rights go. The EU will not listen to the people it is meant to represent. Instead it attempts to bribe its way to a position of favour. Yet European integration is exactly what the people are increasingly opposed to. Why? Because each and every country is slowly waking up to the reality that one size does not suit all in the eurozone, and neither now will one citizenship. I have said before that, if the EU is the answer, it must have been a stupid question. That millions of citizens in countries across the world agree with me is really quite comforting.

 Mr President, this report promotes the stupidity and falsity that is EU citizenship and proceeds to come up with suggestions as to how this ridiculous and failing notion can be promoted. The EU institutions show, with unwavering consistency, how totally out of touch they are with the sentiments and views of the public. The Maastricht Treaty may have created citizenship in principle, but it is a classic example of theory being impossible to put into practice. For example, EU citizenship is impossible to renounce. I do not want it. I was not even asked before it was imposed upon me. We now have clear proof of the desperation entering the thought processes of the federalists in this Parliament. It is their belief that ‘a direct link between some aspect of the tax system and the financing of the European Union’ would make EU citizenship more balanced. As any student of politics knows, linking something to a tax is the sure-fire way of condemning it to the dustbin of history. I have said many times before that if the EU is the answer then the question must have been a stupid one. This report proves that beyond doubt.

 Madam President, this report foreshadows the recruitment and subsidy of selected consumer agencies with a view to promoting the EU’s consumer product legislation and preparing consumers for the adoption of the euro. In other words, the EU institutions are planning to use taxpayers’ money to hire advocates of their own policies. This is nothing but a propaganda exercise of the worst kind because in this way, the state becomes both judge and plaintiff, and independent thought or opposition becomes an underground activity. Is there no substantial understanding of the dangers of this among the Members who sit here now, or in Parliament as a whole? Are they so utterly blind to all but the cosy platitudes of the EU’s carefully engineered, hugely bribed sectoral lobbies? Mr Kristensen’s contribution is scarcely more than a tiny pebble in a landslide of such similar instruments, but it illustrates well enough what is going on. One day Members who now gape at me uncomprehendingly will experience the icy chill up the spine that I experienced today, and the sooner the better. I have said on many other occasions that if the EU was the answer, it must have been a silly question. We can now also see how very dangerous it is.

 Madam President, the changes to the sugar regime will achieve the double whammy of destroying the livelihood of sugar producers in Member States and in the developing world. According to Farmers Weekly
 in the UK, next season, British sugar beet growers will start facing deep price cuts and the possibility of factory closures. One of the ACP countries, St Kitts and Nevis, has already stopped sugar production and it will not be an isolated case. The chairman of the ACP Sugar Group, Mr Arvin Boollel, has said that, following the EU decision, it is very likely that we are all going to suffer from the St Kitts and Nevis situation. He said: ‘We have been shot in the legs and asked to run the marathon’. His country knows all about being shafted by the EU. He is the Agriculture Minister of Mauritius, one of the many developing nations subject to the EU’s scandalous fishing agreements. Only EUR 40 million is on the table. The ACP countries call it peanuts. The Jamaican Foreign Minister, Mr Knight, described it as a miserly approach, a very evocative and relevant thing to say at this time of year. It will not be a sweet Christmas for sugar producers, be they in East Anglia or East Africa. They all know that if the EU and its Scrooges are the answer, it must have been a stupid question.

 Mr President, this report calls for greater investment in education in an attempt to achieve the Lisbon objectives. It might even reflect a call by my Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who in 1997 launched his general election campaign with the mantra ‘education, education, education’. However, decisions on education must be made by the Member States. It is certainly not within the competence of the EU, despite the wish that it should be. The lack of realism within this report is emphasised by the appeal for a 15% increase in the number of science graduates in the EU between now and 2010. This is unachievable because young scientists, once graduated, are emigrating in ever-increasing numbers, mainly to the United States. Even today the Commission’s own survey says 400 000 European science and technology graduates have emigrated to find jobs. Why is this? The answer is startlingly simple: endless EU regulation and red tape is smothering innovative businesses, leaving them with little choice but to relocate or close down. In this context the report serves to highlight the fact that, irrespective of the level of investment made by the Member States in education and training, if businesses and industry have relocated due to suffocating regulation, the investment will not be returned. This report ignores the fact that, at the current rate of progress, the Lisbon objectives will not be reached. Attempts to prevent this failure, even by further EU misguidance, are doomed to fail. As I have said before, if the EU is the answer, it must have been a stupid question. You do not have to be a graduate to understand that.

 Mr President, whilst I do not believe that the United Kingdom should be part of the EU, it would be quite wrong of me to deny the right of those parents who work for the qualifying institutions – in most cases outside their country of origin and in many cases in a country that does not share their mother tongue – to give their children a suitable education. The European schools provide the only practical way for many such parents to exercise that right. I have no quibbles there. In most respects, the rapporteur has considered the European schools in the same proper light. It would be churlish of me not to say so. I do, however, differ from her on one or two points. First of all, the rapporteur defines Category I pupils as children of staff in the service of Community institutions and bodies. There is a significant omission here. Category I status also covers children of the staff of the UK Atomic Energy Authority seconded to the joint European tourist projects in Culham, near Oxford, and children of staff covered by the service regulations of the European Patent Office in Munich. The UK Atomic Energy Authority is most certainly not a Community institution and, furthermore, the joint European tourism project involves one EU pre-accession state, Romania, and one completely non-EU state, Switzerland. As for the European Patent Office, it covers Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, and will soon bring in Norway. As I had to stress during the debate on computer patents, that means that it is most assuredly not a Community institution. I am sad to have to make that point again so soon. Too often we see an assumption in this Parliament that Europe and the EU are one and the same thing. Here is another example. This is not a trivial point in a general sense, nor is it trivial with specific regard to this report, because the rapporteur states that only 1.6% of pupils at Culham are Category I. She may well be correct, but if she actually means that only 1.6% of pupils at Culham are children of staff in the Community institutions then she could be very wide of the mark. I hope she can clarify that statistic. I am most concerned by the Commissioner's suggestion that the option of offering the European baccalaureate outside the current school system should be considered. Could the rapporteur please clarify that as well? Is the Commission suggesting that the European baccalaureate should be available in schools other than the European schools? I simply do not see why it is necessary to interfere with other schools in order to broaden and modernise the curriculum of the European schools. If I were a teacher and a pupil gave the EU as the answer, I would have to conclude that it was a very stupid question.

 Mr President, the phrase 'Television without frontiers' seems innocuous and perhaps it is relevant to the television programme, Jeux sans frontières
. Some might think it is clever to use early television images of pan-European friendship as a metaphor for EU cultural integration. Actually, the concept contains a deeper truth, which supporters of this proposal miss entirely or are deliberately concealing. Television is without frontiers. Twenty years ago, communist regimes could stop human beings getting across the Berlin Wall, but they could not stop television signals being beamed into East German homes. Today technology has moved on and people all over the planet can watch what they like, where they like. Yet the EU presses ahead with this paranoid, illiberal plan, with its quotas of European programming, and we all know what chaos quotas can create. The fact is that, if viewers want to watch American or any other programmes day and night, then nothing can stop them, certainly not the EU – or is that the hidden reality? In the UK Jeux sans frontières
 is called 'It's a Knock-Out'. Europe's viewers, not the politicians, will deal the knock-out blow to this pipedream project, because ordinary people know that if the EU is the answer, then it must have been a stupid question.

 Mr President, computer entrepreneurs are amongst the most independent spirits in the world. I know how they feel, faced with the prospect of this directive. They, as much as anyone, reject the concept of restrictive monoliths. They know that the EU is just such a monolith. The directive is typical of the monolithic actions that they seek to reject. I have worked hard in recent weeks to help computer SMEs resist this directive. However, I have come to realise that the amendments proposed by the rapporteur do not change the fundamental problem. Mr Rocard is trying to remove non-technical features of computer-controlled inventions from the scope of the directive. That in itself is laudable, but he is not seeking to stop the directive overall; in fact he is supporting it. As such, small computer companies are left, one might say, between a Rocard and a hard place. Mr Rocard goes as far as to state in his explanatory statement that he supports the Council’s position in principle. His amendments do not reject the concept of harmonisation. They explicitly support it. One of them even says that the objective of the directive – namely to harmonise national rules on the patentability of computer-controlled inventions – cannot be properly achieved by the Member States. Sadly, Mr Rocard is one of those people, typical in the EU, who increasingly seem to think that the European Patent Office is some sort of subsidiary of the EU, when in fact it covers non-EU countries as well. I reject this directive completely. That is why I will vote against it and Mr Rocard’s version of it. I have always said that, if the EU is the answer, it must have been a silly question. Today that is patently obvious!

. – Mr President, as well as questioning the legitimacy of the EU entering into the International Dolphin Conservation Programme instead of individual States, I would also question whether the EU can be trusted to make the right judgment. Let us consider the facts. The EU is the body whose common fisheries policy has created massive iniquities. Take the unfair treatment of United Kingdom fishermen, now, thanks to Brussels, struggling to survive, while Spanish fishermen, for example, seem able to flout the rules at will. Consider, too, the appalling depletion of fish stocks in EU waters as a direct result of the CFP. Then there is the fact that one million tonnes of dead fish are thrown back into the North Sea every year. Not only is it hugely wasteful, it is also damaging the ecosystem. Evidence, indeed, of the law of unintended consequences. The EU has also concluded unfair and immoral fishing agreements with many third world countries in Africa, which allow European factory farming boats, not unlike the ones that pose a threat to dolphins, to come down and plunder African seas of all their fish. So badly has that hit the local economies that local fishermen have now turned to hunting in their hinterland, destroying local wild animal stocks. These debt-ridden countries have little option but to accept grossly inadequate sums of money for this presumed privilege. It is therefore no surprise to me to see the EU attempt to sign up to an agreement that has been condemned by dolphin conservationists. Why, after all, should the EU listen to experts? Vessels participating in this programme are allowed a dolphin mortality limit. Explosives and speedboats are commonly used to scare dolphins and the programme even allows the deliberate killing of these animals, with over 1 400 observed dead last year, according to the Earth Island Institute’s ‘Dolphin Safe’ programme. If the EU were genuine about this sort of issue, it would adopt the position taken by the United Kingdom and ban pair trawling. After all, we in Britain have made some good decisions. We stayed out of the euro zone, our Prime Minister has probably dealt a mortal blow to the proposed Constitution, but, instead of following good practice, the EU seeks to sign up to a questionable agreement, simply to attempt once more to justify its own dubious international status. It shows, yet again, that if the EU is the answer it must have been a very stupid question.

 Mr President, communication is a two-way process. I sit on the Committee on Culture and Education, which, through its rapporteur, will of course dutifully produce a report for us all to vote on. I have little doubt that the report will eventually pass through this place and find its way onto the statute books of every Member State. Is anybody listening – here, in this Chamber, or out there, in the real world? No one out there can affect that process; no one in here can originate or terminate reports that come our way, so why should anybody care? But the Commission wants them to care, so it decides to spend millions of euros on propaganda – for that is exactly what this is. Paragraph 40 summarises the EU strategy of deception and propaganda. In one breath it is declared that the Union’s institutions have a duty to inform citizens clearly and objectively about the proposed Constitution, yet in the same paragraph it is decreed that these same institutions have a political responsibility to support ratification. How, then, can objectivity figure when the final objective has already been decided? And you wonder why the EU is held in such contempt! My colleagues in UKIP and I will not be supporting the ratification of the Constitution or this shameful report, which admits the true problem but is designed to overcome it by propaganda and lies. I have said before, if the EU is the answer it must have been a silly question: that much you can communicate! (Applause from the IND/DEM Group)

 Madam President, ‘transparency’ is a much-used word in Mrs van den Burg’s report, but there is nothing transparent about the great jumble of committees and processes that she also describes. First, a committee of wise men was set up on the regulation of European securities markets. What wisdom did it bestow? A four-level regulatory approach and the creation of two more committees! Then the Commission appointed four expert groups to mark the first step in the action plan review process. That was in October 2003, long before all of the action plan had even been implemented. If that were not enough, there was input from a monitoring group and four other committees. Who said ‘when in doubt, hold a committee meeting’? Only a report from an EU institution could say with such a straight face that this is a powerful recipe for success, at least in terms of delivering legislation. The EU is very good at churning out laws: that
 is transparently obvious. However, I have a warning for ordinary people out there in the real world, like those in our visitors’ gallery: it is transparent to me that more regulation is coming, thus there will be more laws to break; there will be more interference in pensions and insurance matters; more European-level supervisory bodies that will override national ones; and more back doors through which the EU intends to interfere in national taxation policy. The report notes the existence of overlapping directives that might lead to contradictory and duplicate requirements. In the real world, this would be seen as a work of fiction, not a serious proposition. So, the EU confuses itself, but in the confusion, I should like to repeat one transparent certainty: if the EU is the answer, it must have been a very silly question.

 Mr President, is there anything the EU does not seek to control? Are there any issues at which most Members of the European Parliament will not try to throw taxpayers' money? Sadly, it seems not. Not content with single legal frameworks, tax harmonisation and the rest, the EU apparently wants to control nature. That is patently stupid. The Habitats Directive of 1992, which established Natura 2000, states the EU's intention to define a common framework for the conservation of wild plants and animals. In the bold new Europe, even nature has to be standardised. Wiser counsels know this is impossible. When man seeks to play God, nature has an uncomfortable habit of reasserting itself. As a member of the IND/DEM Group, which has Danish and English co-chairmen, I am reminded of the story of King Canute: tired of the flattery of his courtiers who told him he could control anything and everything, he took them to the beach and commanded the sea to turn back. The waves, of course, continued to lap at their feet and the King had proved his point. It strikes me that Canute had more sense than Europe's rulers have today. If the EU is not power crazy and really is just an economic bloc, perhaps someone could tell me why it is necessary, for example, to list and protect all species of bat? Has anybody asked the bats? No, of course not. Once again, I can only conclude that if the EU is the answer, it must have been a silly question. You could even call it batty!

The European Union destroys jobs – as Tony Blair said in his 1983 election address. It has also passed legislation that has led to the closure of hundreds of local abattoirs. However, this toothless Parliament passes resolutions that are then ignored by both the Council and the Commission. The decisions made by this Parliament on the transportation of animals have been repeatedly ignored and horrendous suffering continues. Over 3 million animals every year endure journeys lasting 30 hours or more in unacceptable conditions and many die in transit. Were this not bad enough, even more suffering is now being planned by the European Union under the REACH Directive, and we will see millions more animals moved around for live testing. To those in the outside world – the real world – who are as appalled as I am by all this, I have a simple message. I wish the European Union would interfere and legislate less, for if the European Union is the answer it must surely have been a very stupid question.

 UKIP is opposed to female genital mutilation, homophobia, racism and xenophobia. However we are also against EU control of fundamental rights. The UK already has perfectly good laws and safeguards on fundamental rights. The EU is not democratic and is therefore not a suitable guardian of people's rights. Moreover, family law is a Member State competence and not an area of EU jurisdiction. The issue of whether drug abusers should face criminal charges is a matter for Member State law and the EU should not be seeking to pervert the course of justice.

 We of course sympathise with the plight of poor countries. However, we feel that the EU policies, such as the common fisheries policy, common agricultural policy and protectionism in trade, are at the root of many of these problems in the first place. We believe nation states are best placed to help developing nations on an intergovernmental basis, not top-down supranational agencies whose policies are to blame in the first place.

 Mr President, the Commission proposal relating to procedure 2008/0051(CNS)
 states in Article 10 that ‘Member States may […] make excise goods which have been released for consumption eligible for reimbursement [...] of excise duty’. On this basis, Ms Lulling tells us that, as regards the conditions for reimbursement of excise duty, the proposal lays down, as a general principle, that it is for Member States to determine these conditions. However, Article 10 goes on to say: ‘provided that such reimbursement [...] does not give rise to exemptions other than those referred to in Article 11’. Article 11 refers to exemptions for diplomatic purposes, for subsidising international organisations, for assisting the armed forces of NATO and under special arrangements with non-EU countries, all of which – I think you will agree – are rather specialised exemptions which, contrary to Ms Lulling’s assertion, do not uphold the general principle that it is for Member States to determine the conditions for reimbursement. There is no exemption for Member States in this proposal, and on these grounds I commend to Members Amendment 54, which seeks to repair a glaring flaw in this proposal.
