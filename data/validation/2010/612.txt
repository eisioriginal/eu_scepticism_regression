Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to list today all of the crises and threats that affect our security and the stability of our continent and its neighbours. Every day – as we have just heard – we hear new reasons that lead us to believe that this multipolar world at the start of the 21st
 century is in many regards more dangerous than the world we had become used to because it is less predictable and less organised: civil war in Syria, Israeli-Arab tensions, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, clashes and crime in the Sahel, piracy off the coast of Somalia and continued fighting in Congo, to list just today’s dangers. In light of this situation, it would be irresponsible to think of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) as a luxury or a bit of an aside. It is a policy that is undoubtedly recent and still being formed. More than any other policy at EU level, it is a policy that is based on the Member States, on their material and human capacities, on their traditions and on their political desire to share, or not, as the case may be, their almost absolute sovereignty in diplomatic and military matters. This leads too many observers – and too many Members here – to believe that the CSDP is negligible or a pointless illusion. On the contrary, we believe – without any naivety or excess illusions – that the CSDP is a strategic necessity for the European Union. That is also why it appears in full in the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Union simply cannot continue just to systematically delegate its security and that of its neighbours. Of course, NATO, which brings together 21 of the 27 Member States, is still the cornerstone of the continent’s common defence, and we should be pleased about that. In addition, we must reaffirm the transatlantic partnership, which is irreplaceable, but it does not exclude efforts and ambitions on the part of the European countries themselves; on the contrary. Indeed, the United States, which has begun a real strategic shift towards Asia and the Pacific is calling on us in Europe to be more active, more robust, more sure of ourselves when it comes to security and defence. Those who call into question the CSDP and say that it duplicates work must realise that it offers pragmatic and intelligent complementarity when it comes to NATO, a military organisation, and the European Union. There are some crises that affect our security and in which NATO cannot intervene; Georgia was one example, and the same applies generally to the African conflicts, where the United States does not feel obliged to intervene, as we saw with the recent example of Libya. Unfortunately, these examples could increase in the future. Action by the European Union is often completely legitimate because its actions comply fully with international law, and there are few third countries that do not acknowledge its balanced role without any ambiguous, unilateral ambitions. It has many ways to act; it has the excellent civilian/military global approach and it is the only body to have this. All too often, unfortunately, what we are missing is political will – above all, on the part of the Member States: a lack of political will – and we have to emphasise this, too – or motivation on the part of certain Brussels institutions that are in charge of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the CSDP, a lack of vision at times, a reluctance to act in the Council, an ideological reluctance because we believe that soft power is more effective that the use of an armed force, and an absence of clear priorities that, too often, give the impression that we are making it up as we go along. The strategic challenges that we face are enormous and unprecedented: a structural and sustainable reduction in the defence budgets of European countries, the reorientation of US priorities, volatility and an extremely diverse range of threats. Therefore, the Member States either have to undergo a major and collective strategic downgrade, or pick themselves up and exploit as best they can, the potential of the CSDP, modest as it still may be. There is no doubt that most of our efforts today should focus on capacity-building, and in this regard we emphasise in the report the virtues of the pooling and sharing initiative promoted by the European Defence Agency, which is a step in the right direction. The economic and strategic crises must not be used as an excuse – and this is important, Mr President – to turn our backs, but should instead be an opportunity to strengthen our common ambition. (Applause) Arnaud Danjean,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I would like to thank all of my colleagues who were involved in the preparation of this report in all of their groups. It is very pleasing to see such a broad consensus that the European Union has to equip itself with the means to achieve a global, international ambition, including a security and defence policy. Like the Minister, I am sorry that our British colleagues still have a very ideological and completely unpragmatic position, which is reflected in their actions. They have spoken here as the representatives of a great military nation, but they should not be under any illusions. That great military nation is also going to suffer, and is already suffering, a considerable strategic decline, with defence budget cuts, and problems with materials and human resources, like all European countries. Of course, NATO is our last resource, but NATO will not be able to intervene always and everywhere to defend European interests. Some Member States are not members of NATO. Some NATO countries will not always be prepared to defend European interests. We have to face up to that possibility. The European Union must therefore maintain a form of autonomy, which is not rivalry, competition or duplication, but intelligent complementarity. That is already the case across all of the European Union’s missions: more than a dozen missions are being carried out successfully today and are expected – and this is the most important aspect – by the countries that are in crisis. They recognise the European Union’s legitimacy and, undoubtedly, they would not be prepared to do that for any other international actor. We must be proud of that and we must restate this ambition. I hope that the relatively strong vote tomorrow in favour of this report will help the High Representative and the Council to forge ahead. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, the free and exemplary elections that took place in Georgia, which we had the privilege of observing with some of our colleagues, have resulted in democratic change in that country, which is a great privilege in the region.  The irony, of course, is that those who won the election, and we must congratulate them, are also those who during the campaign complained about a dictatorship run by criminals. We can only hope now that these new leaders will be somewhat wiser and reasonable in government than they were at times during the campaign. The European Union – as you did so successfully during your first trip to Tbilisi, it has to be said – must, without any paranoia or naivety, pay close attention to what happens in Georgia and judge the new authorities on their actions and their results, not just their declared intentions. It must also remain vigilant and remind those authorities that a change is not the same as revenge. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we are all aware of the extent of your task and the difficulties involved in coordinating the Member States, which are highly sensitive about their diplomatic and military prerogatives. That requires us to be somewhat lenient and to recognise willingly that you do not spare any efforts. Nevertheless, it is impossible for us today not to express a degree of disappointment or even frustration, and this is clearly expressed in the Brok report, which underlines the lack of any clear sense of strategic priorities for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). Your commendable objective is the implementation of the comprehensive approach, which should give the European Union added value on the international stage. However, I must admit that the approach seems, above all, to be global in its dimension and, I was going to say, in its geographical scope. If we want to be everywhere, all the time, one sometimes wonders what the European Union actually does and where it really exercises successful global capabilities. You rightly mentioned the Horn of Africa; it is true that the EU is putting all of its resources, including its military resources, to work there, and it is still a success, but a limited success. The CFSP really has to get away from the fragmented, divided initiatives that take shape in response to emergencies and new situations and which concentrate on a hierarchy of priorities and truly coherent mobilisation of all of its instruments. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Mr President, I must say I am quite surprised to see Georgia being discussed today. Sure, as has been pointed out, there are visits by eminent public figures. Sure, there are elections to be held in October. However, this is not the only country where there are important visits and elections. We all know why we are talking about Georgia today. We are talking about Georgia today because a certain oligarch has decided to take part in the elections – which is his right - and because he has flooded the coffers of lobbyists in Washington and Brussels with dollars and euros, which has obviously paid off as we have placed Georgia on our agenda, not to talk about the Russian occupation, or about Russia’s violation of cease-fire agreements or about Russian military manoeuvres during October, in the midst of elections, but about the electoral process in Georgia. You have pointed out a number of resolutions in which we voted for an independent civil society, for a strong and credible opposition. An oligarch’s millions of dollars do not make a strong and credible opposition, nor do they create an independent civil society. Of course, we should not be giving a blank cheque to Mr Saakashvili. Yet I think that giving a blank cheque to this oligarch who has gone into politics is much more dangerous. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the resolution on the upcoming presidential elections in Russia, to be held on 4 March 2012, and on the controversial outcome of the legislative elections of 4 December 2011. With this text, we wanted to condemn the lack of transparency and impartiality of the Russian electoral system, prone to multiple cases of fraud, the lack of neutrality of the media, and the convergence of the state and the governing party. The aim of this resolution is therefore to express the EU’s concerns with regard to the situation of human rights and the rule of law in Russia. We urge Russia to hold free and democratic elections, and to punish those responsible for all forms of fraud and intimidation. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
),

 I supported and participated in the drafting of this resolution in order to respond quickly to an unprecedented deterioration of the situation in Syria. I therefore voted in favour of this text, which calls for the regime to end the atrocities committed, to support the initiatives undertaken by the Arab League to end the crisis, and to strongly condemn the support shown by Russia and China for the Syrian regime. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
),

 I voted in favour of maintaining the funds of the European Programme of food aid for the most deprived (PEAD) for two additional years (2012 and 2013). Indeed, it is our responsibility to ensure the survival of such a programme, which has helped more than 18 million deprived people in 19 Member States of the European Union since 1987 (under the CAP). This programme will therefore continue to supply food to numerous charities working to eradicate hunger, with an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million. At present, our new fight, in which I wish to be fully engaged, is to ensure the long-term sustainability of this important solidarity programme by guaranteeing its funding beyond 2013. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation on contractual relations in the milk sector. In effect, the report is, largely, a response to the terrible crisis that afflicted the milk sector in 2008-2010, when prices paid to producers collapsed dramatically. Furthermore, it looks to prepare dairy producers for the expiry of dairy quotas in 2015. In this way, it aims to increase the bargaining power of dairy producers in order to ensure that they receive fairer prices for their products, without encroaching on the right to competition. In order to do this, the new regulation permits, amongst others things, dairy producers to be able to join producer organisations so that they can gain real clout against processors as well as ensuring fairer distribution of added value along the supply chain. In the long term, this approach aims to provide a fairer standard of living for dairy producers. Today, therefore, I urge dairy producers to fully embrace the new tools established by European legislation, so that they may help further their interests, find their place in the market and prepare themselves for the ‘post-quota era’. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
).

 Mr President, the situation in Syria is currently the most serious and painful challenge facing the international community. Bombarding your own people with heavy artillery, imprisoning and torturing civilians, including children: these are things that we cannot tolerate and which bear witness to the blindness of a criminal regime. It is easy to become indignant and to condemn; it is harder to act, and to act effectively. Once we exclude – properly I believe – the possibility of military intervention as in Libya, we should recognise that our scope for action is very limited. There are, however, ways to contribute to the further isolation of this regime, an isolation that is, as Mr Brok emphasised, without doubt, the most realistic way forward. First of all, sanctions, on which the EU has taken the lead. These must be reinforced as much as possible, and they are a useful course of action. In the key area of diplomacy, we must first condemn the unchallengeable Russian and Chinese vetoes and we must, above all, make these countries realise that such vetoes are not only unacceptable, they are also incomprehensible and are a dead end for those countries themselves. The Arab League is taking initiatives; it is playing a major role which is to be welcomed and which ought to be supported and strengthened, even if all of the options that it presents are unrealisable in the short term. These initiatives have the immense merit of being in existence and of being widely adopted by responsible countries. Beyond the political need to apply maximum pressure on the Syrian regime and those who support it, like Iran and Russia, there is also a humanitarian emergency. The demand for unconditional, immediate access to the victims has no need of a UN resolution; it is an absolute moral duty. The EU and its Member States must bring all of their weight to bear to push forward the Arab League‘s initiatives and bring an end to the scandal of this repression from another age. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
).

 Mr President, the excellent report by our colleague, Mr Lisek, highlights the main constraint affecting national and multilateral defence efforts, now and in the future, namely, budgetary restraint. European countries will also be affected by another strategic constraint: the attitude of our US friends and allies, who are no longer willing or able to do everything for us where security is concerned. The Libyan case illustrated this point well. Therefore, in this very restrictive context, we must revive the ambition for a common security and defence policy which is strong on operations and capabilities. In terms of operations, Baroness Ashton, you talk at length – and rightly so – about this famous comprehensive approach that undoubtedly only the European Union has the power to promote in terms of the main international crises. We still need to ensure – and this is your role – that this comprehensive approach does not sacrifice security elements and, where appropriate, military elements. It must be truly comprehensive, without watering down this security aspect. That is the positive message you have given us through the Sahel and Horn of Africa strategies, and I welcome it. In terms of capabilities, we must, of course, welcome the European Defence Agency’s role, even if there are unfortunately still some restrictions on its budget. I would be grateful if you could make your assessment of the European Defence Agency’s efforts known. When talking about the defence industry, we must also remember that strengthening and supporting our European defence industries – obviously without forgetting to rationalise them – also supports jobs and technologies that extend far beyond the defence sector alone and which are of huge strategic importance to our economies, particularly during times of crisis. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
).

 Madam President, I hope that the resolution on Libya that we will be voting on tomorrow, and on which there is broad agreement, will be just as relevant as the resolution that we approved here six months ago, where the bulk of the provisions have proved perfectly reasonable. The condemnation and sanctions aimed at the Gaddafi regime, the introduction of the principle of the duty to protect civilian populations, if necessary through recourse to military force, and the recognition of the legitimacy of the National Transitional Council: all of these provisions were approved here before they were ever discussed in the European Council or implemented by the Member States. They form the backbone of the action taken by the international community. We should honour all those countries, particularly the European countries, of which there are many, that have been steadfastly committed to supporting the Libyan people’s desire for freedom through both diplomatic and military means. I feel that it is also important to pay tribute to the French pilots who, on 19 March, wiped out the columns of Colonel Gaddafi’s troops that were marching on Benghazi, thereby preventing the town from being added to the roll-call of ravaged towns mourned by Europe, such as Vukovar and Srebrenica. Six months on, obviously we need to avoid unwarranted optimism, because although Colonel Gaddafi’s reign has come to an end, the conflict itself has not, and also because the challenges associated with the embryonic transition are massive and far from resolved. The European Union therefore needs to act now by taking a leading role in this delicate phase. We need to work with other international players to offer prompt assistance and support that go beyond the humanitarian efforts that have already been made and that focus primarily on supporting civil movements, establishing institutions and organising the security sector. First and foremost, these concerted efforts must be based on one clear principle, namely that this transition must be guided by the Libyans themselves and that no one, albeit with the best intentions in the world, can take the place of the Libyan people’s hopes for independence. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, on behalf of the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to congratulate you on your presentation of this very ambitious programme. You mentioned, with good reason, the external crises and the need to ensure the security and defence of the European Union, and were right to do so. While the Libyan crisis has, unfortunately, once again reminded us of and illustrated the difficulties the European Union faces in existing as such, in the international arena, we are pleased that the Polish Presidency has the courage to take on this debate. It should be emphatically noted that the common security and defence policy is not a secondary option, but rather it is a necessity. It is, firstly, an aim which is enshrined in the Treaty and is thus binding on the Member States and European institutions. It is also a strategic necessity; every day, with all the crises and threats all around us, we are finding that our US friends and allies cannot and do not want to do everything on our behalf. Lastly, it is an economic imperative at a time of budgetary restraint. Defence has a cost which many of our citizens consider exorbitant. To maintain our defence capabilities, as well as our industries, our expertise and our jobs, we must collectively streamline our defence budgets. The Member States must accept their responsibilities, but the European Union institutions – and I am thinking here of the High Representative and the External Action Service – should function more as a source of initiatives, and we are counting on the Polish Presidency to stimulate these initiatives. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the Libyan crisis has, unfortunately, once again illustrated the European Union’s difficulties in existing diplomatically and militarily. However, it would be most unfair to blame you solely for the lack of political will displayed by the Union, even if many of us believe that more decisive action could have been and should have been taken. It is also true that the Member States bear a great deal of responsibility for this inability to come up with a coherent, effective and visible policy on this matter, while our US friends relied heavily on Europe to act. The Libyan crisis aside, however, we must be mindful of the major strategic developments that mean that we must not give up on the ambition of a common security and defence policy, as enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, and which you, Baroness Ashton, must continue to inspire, support and speak up for. Taken together, the unprecedented fiscal constraints on defence budgets, the many international crises and the United States’ strategic redeployment are significant factors that leave us no choice but to take our destiny into our own hands. Faced with these many crises and threats, we cannot just hand over the keys to our US friends and allies or to NATO. Neither the United States nor NATO was able to end the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, for example, and nor can the United States or NATO observe the current ceasefire there. It is the European mission that has full legitimacy. We can clearly see in Libya that the United States did not want to be in the front line and that NATO’s minimum undertaking is insufficient. Baroness Ashton, the common security and defence policy is not just something achieved over 10 years or just an ambition enshrined in the Treaties. It is also a strategic requirement, and you must be at the forefront taking the necessary initiatives. (Applause) Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you emphasised – and we are all aware of this – the urgent need to take action in response to the Libyan crisis. You rightly pointed out what the European Union has done and has done rather well in humanitarian terms and in terms of the evacuation of European citizens. Indeed, I think that the European Union would have gained from publicising these actions and making them much more visible, because people too often have the impression that the Member States alone carry out these operations, whereas you have pointed out that European mechanisms have worked here. On a political and military level now, a reminder of the need for a no-fly zone is certainly necessary, if not just politically, then also militarily. It will take more than that, however, because – let us not forget – no-fly zones did not prevent atrocities on the ground in Bosnia and Kosovo, even when, in the case of overflying, they were applied very rigorously. While we await the UN Security Council’s decisions, we have European common security and defence policy instruments. We can implement them for the purposes of maritime surveillance, monitoring the embargo and delivering humanitarian aid. Europe has to make its voice heard on this point, and you have the instruments with which to act. Arnaud Danjean,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the subject we are dealing with today is one that we ought to have begun looking at many months ago, given that the security situation in the Sahel region has been steadily deteriorating for over three years now. Furthermore, we are dealing with the subject in a week in which we in France have buried two innocent young victims of Islamic terrorism, who were killed on the Niger-Mali border a few weeks ago. Aside from the intense feelings that these crimes arouse, we need to recognise the real threats concentrated in this region on Europe’s doorstep, as the threat is not only from terrorism, even though the kidnappings and murders are the most dramatic manifestation of the deteriorating situation in Mauritania, Mali and Niger. Criminal networks are rife. Trafficking in drugs, arms and human beings is threatening the stability of these countries, but also that of our own continent. For make no mistake, in the same way that the majority of the victims of the terrorist acts in this region are European citizens, Europe is also the destination for this trafficking. In the face of this extremely worrying situation, the European Union should put in place an integrated, comprehensive strategy to combine its development and security policies. This is absolutely vital. There are initiatives already in place of course, via the tenth European Development Fund (EDF) in particular, and almost EUR 2 billion have been set aside for these countries for combating poverty, developing the economy and establishing more effective governance. Certain Member States have bilateral cooperation policies, too, of course. However, we now need to go much further. In particular, our action needs to be much more coordinated. We need to strengthen the regional approach and encourage these countries to work together more to deal with the common challenges they face. We also need to expand the range of policies at the EU’s disposal and integrate them as much as possible, in the areas of development, security, strengthening institutional structures, customs, the courts and the police. Baroness Ashton, there are few regions so close to Europe that harbour so many threats to our security and there are few regions in which the EU can at last put into practice the integrated approach envisaged in the Treaty of Lisbon, on the basis of which the European External Action Service which you currently head was formed. Baroness Ashton, please can you give us some details about the strategy that you intend to implement in this region? Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Madam President, to correct what has been said, Mr Arlacchi is quite right, the final text proposed to us no longer contains, in Recital B, the words ‘occupation force’. Quite simply, the translations, and particularly the French translation, were not correct in the latest version, and the French translation, until this morning, still contained the expression ‘occupation force’, hence the speech by my colleague Mr Juvin. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I share your opinion on the Lisbon Summit which has come up with a new strategic concept which is satisfactory overall. However, we should nonetheless recognise, in all honesty, that the poor relation of this text is, in view of the potential of this strategic partnership, the European Union-NATO relationship, which should be a great deal more ambitious. You rightly noted the successes and progress of capability development. You noted successes, obviously, in the case of Afghanistan, where we are managing to reach compromises on the ground. However, it is unsatisfactory that we do not have a structured political dialogue with NATO, apart from the single case of Bosnia We all know that the problem is that of Turkey. We are going to have to deal with it seriously, no doubt pragmatically, and I hope that the efforts you are making with Secretary General Rasmussen will bear fruit. I briefly want to say that the problem of duplication is often advanced to highlight the weaknesses of the European Union and to limit the European Union’s aspiration to be ambitious. This is a false problem because there are not two armies in our Member States, a NATO army and a European Union army. There is an armed force in each country and it is up to the country to choose whether to place its troops under the NATO banner or the European Union banner. Let us stop scaremongering with this notion of duplication. I would like to say a word about complementarity: it is essential and must be applied intelligently. I would not want to see complementarity becoming an imperative with the European Union becoming the Red Cross of what would be a NATO armed force. The European Union must keep its military capabilities, hold onto its military ambitions and must retain its ambition in the case of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) as was pointed out in the tripartite Franco-German and Polish letter. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
).

Mr President, I will make three brief points on this subject. Firstly, as the issue at stake was France’s position regarding the sale of the Mistral, may I remind you that no firm agreement has been reached, that the Mistral is a vessel, a ship that would be sold unarmed – which is really one of the fundamental issues at the heart of talks with Russia – and that Russia has not only entered into negotiations with France to purchase this type of equipment. So, allow me to put things into perspective. I realise that there is a great deal of emotion in some countries, but emotion is one thing, the facts are quite another. Secondly, as you pointed out, Minister, we have within the European Union a code of conduct for arms exports that became a common position under the French Presidency in 2008; this code of conduct is one of the most demanding in the world. We are above exemplary on the matter, and we have, in addition to this code of conduct, as one of our fellow Members reminded us, a group that meets on a regular basis as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy to discuss not only the implementation of this code but also Member States’ national policies on arms exports. There are, therefore, forums in which the Mistral issue can be dealt with quite adequately. Lastly, allow me to say that, if we are talking about European solidarity on arms exports and if we are looking at the need to have a common strategy and a common defence policy, we need to look at the entire cycle of trade in arms and defence equipment. That also involves imports and obviously the defence industry. From that point of view, I believe that many countries also have a long way to go to ensure that Europe can maintain technologies, jobs, know-how and a real strategic capacity in our military deployments. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I should like to express the unequivocal support of the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and our unequivocal support for the very fine compromise negotiated by Mr Brok, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Gualtieri. Indeed, this is an important milestone in the creation of a common European policy in areas as sensitive as foreign affairs, security and defence. Every day, from Georgia to the coasts of Somalia, from the Balkans to Gaza, we can clearly see how much this common policy is needed and also – I was going to say above all – how much our citizens want it. Because, above and beyond the interinstitutional powers which we are welcoming today in this compromise and, in particular, the increased role given to Parliament, we must clearly emphasise the strategic opportunity represented by this External Action Service, which is an essential tool for equipping the EU with a more ambitious, more consistent, more credible and more effective common foreign and security policy. Baroness Ashton, may I say to you, as Chair of Parliament’s Subcommittee on Security and Defence and also, to some extent, as a Frenchman, that I insist on the particular responsibility which you will have to exercise, that of crisis management, by preserving and strengthening the EU’s unique character and added value, in other words, its civil-military capabilities – the two words go together. You are the one who will be responsible for ensuring that the EU maintains and increases its capabilities by rejecting the ill-founded suspicions that are voiced here and there – and indeed sometimes in this Chamber – to the effect that the service will be militarised, and by joining with Parliament as much as possible in clearly affirming the legitimacy of any operations conducted by the EU in crisis locations. Arnaud Danjean,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy that we are presenting today is an annual document by Parliament that provides a kind of interim assessment of the European Security and Defence Policy and submits proposals aimed at improving the effectiveness and visibility of that policy. This year, this report lies within a very specific context, and thus it should become a force for proposals. This specific context is characterised by the combination of three major cycles. The first concerns the 10 years of the European Security and Defence Policy, which we celebrated at the end of 2009. The last 10 years showed that Europe was able to conduct civil and military operations at the scene of more than 23 crises. That fundamental achievement can be built on further. It shows that there is a demand for Europe and that the Union has the institutional­political and operational ability to rise to these challenges. The second important cycle is, of course – and Mr Albertini mentioned it a moment ago – the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. The change in terms of security and defence goes far beyond a strict semantic adjustment. Indeed, the ESDP becomes the Common Security and Defence Policy, the CSDP, and it must take on a new dimension. The Treaty has enriched the range of tools and the scope of security and defence policy, particularly with the inclusion of assistance clauses, of solidarity clauses, with permanent structured cooperation and, above all, with the creation of the European External Action Service and of your role as High Representative, Vice-President of the Commission. Lastly, the third major event that characterises the context in which this report was drafted is that NATO which, for 21 of the 27 members of the Union, is still the main reference point where the collective security of the European continent is concerned, is currently revising its strategic concept and that this assessment by NATO should also lead us, the Union, to define more clearly the conditions of this partnership, which remains fundamental. In this context, the report’s objective is less about persisting with a doctrine than about providing you with a necessarily evolving roadmap, for all the new institutions that are being established and that must learn to work together. The aim is to make the Union more credible, more effective and more visible in security and defence terms. In this regard, the European Parliament absolutely must be given a greater degree of responsibility in these sensitive areas if a policy of which the main aim is to guarantee the security of European citizens is to be fully legitimate. With this report, we wanted to stress the following points. Firstly, we wanted to point out that, above all, the European Security and Defence Strategy and the Common Security and Defence Policy are there to serve the people of Europe, to guarantee and improve their security. This political ambition is not superfluous; it is not for appearances’ sake. It corresponds to a need for our continent to strive to ensure its own security but also to contribute to the stability of the world around us, to tackle the crises and the threats that are developing in our environment. Beyond the traditional armed conflicts that continue to take place in our immediate environment, Europe must be able to express its interests and defend them in the face of the new threats – I am thinking in particular of piracy and cybercrime. We also felt it important to stress just how unequalled Europe’s added value in crisis management is, thanks to the variety of solutions it provides and the balance that it strikes in each of its operations between the civil and military dimensions. Moreover, in this regard, I reject the criticisms that some may direct at the Union’s security and defence policy, namely to suggest that it is all about militarisation. I sincerely believe in the complementary nature of the civil and military instruments that the Union possesses, and the recent crisis in Haiti, where you went – and I believe that you were able to observe this good cooperation – testifies to the need to link our civil and military resources so that we can cope with natural disasters and major crises. Precisely on the subject of these operations, we were anxious to review them all, to highlight what we feel are their strengths, but also, at times, their weaknesses – they have to be acknowledged so that things can improve. We were also anxious to highlight several regions of strategic importance for the security of the Union and to encourage the Council and the Commission to speed up the implementation of global strategies, in particular, for the Horn of Africa and for the Afghanistan­Pakistan region. In the area of capabilities – both civil and military – which is a crucial issue in terms of the credibility of our policy, the challenge is to improve the Union’s responsiveness. We have to be able to mobilise more quickly and more effectively the material resources and the competent personnel that the Member States have at their disposal. However, we also have to have the capability, by means of a security and defence industry that is efficient, that combines invaluable technological knowledge and that also accounts for hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe, to provide ourselves with equipment programmes corresponding to these forecasted needs. The Europe of industry and defence has begun to organise itself on our continent through the defence package. Issues relating to industrial and trade cooperation with third countries should be addressed quickly, particularly in the light of the recent problems encountered by European industries trying to access the US market, for example. This is a brief, inevitably overly brief, summary of the priorities that appear in this report and which represent all the challenges that you will have to take up. Parliament is ready to play its full role, its full positive and constructive role, to help you realise this ambition, which is a common ambition. Moreover, I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank all the political groups that have worked hard to enrich this report. We have all cooperated very well together to maintain a high level of ambition, while taking account, of course, of the characteristics of each of our groups. I would also take advantage of this opportunity, Baroness Ashton, to address with you today the issue of non­proliferation. On the eve of the Non­Proliferation Treaty review conference, to be held in May, the European Parliament wished to review with you the Union’s commitment in relation to the fight against proliferation, and to the control of arms and disarmament; this is the meaning behind the oral questions that have been put to you and which you will answer shortly. The international context seems to offer new opportunities on the eve of this review conference. Firstly, President Obama has strongly affirmed his ambition to have a world without nuclear weapons and his commitment to actively seek the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear­Test­Ban Treaty by the United States. Secondly, the conclusion with Russia of a new agreement designed to supersede the START Agreement seems to be going well and, lastly, we have the launch of the negotiations on a new disarmament treaty that would prohibit the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. With regard to the reduction in nuclear arsenals, the priority is obviously to reduce the two main arsenals, that is, those of Russia and the United States, which it is commonly believed still alone hold nearly 95% of all the nuclear weapons that exist on the planet. We therefore welcome the commitment made by Presidents Medvedev and Obama to conclude a new reduction agreement in the near future. How does the Union, in this context, envisage supporting these efforts and cooperating with the United States and Russia? The Union must also rise to the challenges posed to the non­proliferation regime and, more specifically, to those with which we are confronted by the two major proliferation crises that are Iran and North Korea, which remain the main threats to international security. Will the Union continue to commit itself effectively, completely, to resolving these crises, particularly in the case of Iran? We expect your guidance on this major issue, Baroness Ashton. Moreover, the Union has a role to play in promoting cooperation relating to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. You know that this is an important challenge. What actions are being carried out in this context, and what is your strategy on the matter? Lastly, the European Parliament wants the Union to be a proactive force during the forthcoming Non­Proliferation Treaty review conference. The adoption of a new ambitious and balanced common position by the Union is crucial if the latter is to defend its position. Where do the Member States stand in this regard? Arnaud Danjean,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all the speeches which, once again, have helped to enrich the debate, to enrich this report. I would like to reassure those who have voiced their doubts and, at times, their suspicions, about the fact that this report might open the door to more competition, with NATO in particular, and even to isolation. This is by no means the case; I absolutely do not believe that, and I would add that this does not appear in the treaty, quite the opposite. You can believe a French MEP who has fought tirelessly to have his country reinstated within the integrated structures of NATO. When we talk about strategic autonomy, what idea are we developing, what policy have we been developing, for 10 years? The answer is the ability of the European Union to intervene via civil and military missions in areas in which other organisations, including NATO, cannot. NATO could not have intervened to put a stop to the conflict in Georgia, where there is no UN or OSCE presence. NATO intervened no earlier than we did in the Horn of Africa to put a stop to events threatening our security interests. Strategic autonomy also means the ability to intervene with a range of instruments that we alone possess: civil and military instruments, legal instruments, financial instruments, development instruments. The European Union is best placed to develop this global approach in crisis areas. Our strategic autonomy also refers to our ability, where necessary, not to intervene, either in unilateral military campaigns, or – and this has been pointed out by several Austrian Members – because there are neutral countries among us and because we respect their status. This is what is meant by European defence and security. This is what is meant by the strategic autonomy that we are developing by means of this policy. Never forget the origins of this European Security and Defence Policy. It originates in a tragic, bloody failure: that of the Balkans in the 1990s, where the European Union was incapable of coping with a major security challenge on its own continent. Let us not forget that. Our European citizens have not forgotten it, and they would not forgive us if we abandoned the ambition to see Europe play a role on the international stage. (Applause) Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Mr President, Mrs Ashton, the events on Ashura Day and the bloody repression of the recent demonstrations in Iran have shown that it was a total mistake to make a very artificial distinction between the hardening of the regime internally and the inflexible policy that it pursues externally, in particular, on the Iranian nuclear issue. Consequently, the prospect of additional sanctions seems inevitable, or even desirable. I would like to know your point of view on the timetable and the nature of possible sanctions precisely so that we can make a clear link between the internal events in Iran and the nuclear issue. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
).

Madam President, Mrs Ashton, you were right to stress that the important thing in Yemen in terms of security priority is to end the internal conflicts that exist in that country. We must not confuse the causes and the consequences, and without playing down the terrorist risk, the main reason for the instability in Yemen is not terrorism. Terrorism develops because there is instability due to internal conflicts. From this point of view, the priority of the European Union should be to encourage and to support the efforts currently being made to start a national dialogue in Yemen with President Saleh. At regional level, there are – as we have just been reminded – links with the Somalian crisis and the crisis in the Horn of Africa. There are very sizeable migratory flows, but also arms trafficking and movement of jihadist fighters between Yemen and Somalia. In this respect, I would like to know where the European Union stands as regards the strengthening of maritime surveillance capacities, which also concern Yemen. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Madam President, much has been said about the action plan on Afghanistan. Speaking for myself, I regret that the presentations given to us today did not place slightly more emphasis on the link between the EUPOL mission and the NATO mission in Afghanistan. This is a mission that we must carry out. The quantitative and qualitative problems that it is encountering are mainly due to the link with NATO and, in order to be effective, we must solve them as quickly as possible. I would have liked more to have been said about this. My question concerns Pakistan, the chronic instability of which is, as we all know, a factor in the crisis for the entire region and for Afghanistan, too. I see, in the action plan, that cooperation with Pakistan is envisaged in the areas of counter-terrorism and security. In that country there is, as we know, a significant ideological and sometimes structural and organisational connection between radical Islamic movements that operate in Kashmir and at the Afghan border. I wanted to be sure that the methods, the nature and the timeframe of the assistance that we envisage are gauged properly, in order to prevent this connection from having extremely adverse and harmful effects.

Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, you rightly pointed out that the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon was going to enable us to enter a new era of enlargement policy, and we have to embark on this new process with realism and a clear head: that is the essence of this resolution. On the one hand, a new process does not mean going for broke. That would be the surest way of creating misunderstandings, even suspicion, among the public, and it would also be the best way of creating false ideas among the candidate countries and of encouraging them to take refuge in rhetorical and cosmetic policies rather than in policies aimed at more thorough reforms. We must be wary of steps, conditions and values on which we cannot compromise, and I believe in particular in cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal. On the other hand, it must be reaffirmed, in the clearest of terms, that the place of the western Balkans, of all the countries of the western Balkans, including Kosovo, is indeed in the European Union, and that we must encourage them to continue and to increase their efforts. There is no contradiction between making the demands clear, on the one hand, and showing full support for the process of enlargement to include the western Balkans, on the other, just as there is no contradiction between pursuing this philosophy of judging everyone on merit and having to take important initiatives for all of the countries in the region, such as visa liberalisation. Finally, allow me to say a word about Turkey. Before speculating on any very hypothetical future outcome concerning Turkey’s accession process, I will simply say that the Commission has noted, for the second year running, that no progress was made on the Ankara Protocol and that that prevented any new negotiating chapters from being opened. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, what I have to say has been said many times over by my fellow Members. At a time when Europe is considering a common strategy for its supply of raw materials and especially rare earths, we cannot overlook the huge potential that the intelligent recovery of our waste offers. Strengthening European standards so as to improve the functioning of the collection chain, solving problems relating to the leakage and illegal export of WEEE, and setting more ambitious collection targets: that is what should be at the heart of this legislation. Let us not forget who is chiefly responsible for the success or failure of this legislation: the consumer. Empowering the public is crucial if we want to implement effective legislation. To this end, Mr Florenz, the eco-contribution, among other systems, has proved to be a very important tool. Of course, electrical and electronic equipment producers must become more involved in the collection and recycling system, but we cannot absolve the citizens of all responsibility for the waste they produce. Our citizens must become actors and not spectators in European environmental policy. Catherine Soullie  (PPE
).

Madam President, Christians are, without doubt, one of the most persecuted religious groups in the world. In the Middle East, they are seen by some extremist groups as – I quote – ‘legitimate targets’, and the end goal is their departure, pure and simple, from this region, a region which saw the birth of Christianity, and a region in which their historical presence is essential for a certain kind of balance. The events in the Baghdad cathedral are merely the culmination of a situation that we have been observing passively for far too long. The European Union, as a global player and a business partner of various countries in this region, must strongly express its indignation with regard to this situation. Discrimination, of whatever kind, cannot be tolerated. Democracy will only be victorious in this region when the most fundamental human rights, such as religious freedom, are respected.

 In adopting this resolution, the European Parliament, the voice of European citizens and democracy, is sending a clear message to the Chinese authorities: that eradicating and subjugating one culture to benefit another is an act that is not worthy of any truly great and modern country. The Tibetan people have a wholly legitimate request: that their history and language should be respected. Tibetan culture is not the only one threatened by this unreasonable decision – Cantonese and other languages will also fall victim to the policy of standardisation. Given that the Chinese Constitution specifically recognises each citizen’s right to express him/herself in his/her chosen language, how can the political authorities justify this legal U-turn? The European Union’s motto clearly sums up the message that we have a duty to pass on to the Chinese authorities through this resolution: united in diversity. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, union and realism will be on show, at least I should like that to be the case, tomorrow when we vote on our resolution for this Sixteenth Conference of the Parties on Climate Change. I therefore hope that our Commissioner in charge will be able to keep the pragmatic targets that we must meet collectively, but also to defend the absolutely non-negotiable associated conditions that Europe has set. Neither must we lose sight in these negotiations of the expectations that our fellow citizens and our industries have of a fair balance. It is the world that must fight climate change, and not Europe on its own. Therefore it will be essential to recognise the importance of intellectual property that is inadequately protected. Green technologies must be of benefit to the greatest number, but that does not mean that we must sell our current and future knowledge on the cheap, even for the sake of this vital battle against climate change. Similarly, to ask for common methods of calculating emissions as well as verification and publication of data so that all emitting industries are put on the same scale seems to be a most legitimate request and not a negotiating tactic. Finally, and my fellow Member raised this just now, more controversial are the loopholes in the current Clean Development Mechanism that are also to be put on the table. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all, regretfully, well aware that the real negotiating power does not lie with the European Parliament. However, the willingness of a number of MEPs, myself included, to work and to participate in a positive outcome of this conference must be encouraged and not neglected, as we have felt it to be in the last few days. If Europe wishes to be strong at the heart of international dialogues, so must all its lawmakers be likewise. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 The vote on Mrs Estrela’s report is vitally important. The position adopted is purely demagogic and irresponsible. By demanding 20 weeks of maternity leave, we are discrediting the European Parliament. We are the citizens’ voice; to adopt such unrealistic positions would not do justice to them. Very significant costs for the social budgets of Member States would be incurred: as regards France, for instance, the amount would be EUR 1.3 billion. The current economic situation does not allow us to absorb this kind of increase within state budgets, not to mention the consequences for our companies who will have to bear part of these additional costs. We need to support and encourage women to better reconcile maternity and work, not scupper their chances of finding a job. The increase from 14 to 18 weeks proposed by the Commission was a real step forward; a step that could have been built on by giving some thought to new childcare options. The message conveyed by this text carries huge responsibility: maternity would clearly become a barrier to personal development in the workplace. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Madam President, the scale of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is clearly such that it demands us EU political representatives to ask ourselves questions about the safety of our own oil installations. In fact, one of the keys to protecting the marine environment is to ensure that oil exploration sites are as safe as possible. Nevertheless, the idea of a moratorium on current and future oil drilling in our waters is clearly premature and inappropriate. Premature, because the outcome of the investigation into the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is not yet known, and some preliminary conclusions confirm that it was due to a combination of behavioural, organisational and technical errors. Inappropriate because − as has been said several times − different regulations apply in the North Sea, in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico. Is it worth pointing out here the serious economic and social consequences that a moratorium would have, not to mention how it might jeopardise our energy independence? Last week, Norway and Russia ended a 40-year dispute and a 30-year moratorium by confirming the principle of a common maritime border in the Barents Sea and the Arctic. This agreement will, in practice, result in the two countries sharing a hydrocarbon-rich area. How, then, could the EU executive at the same time plan to ask for these oil activities to be suspended and for them to voluntarily place themselves in a position of weakness from an energy and economic point of view?

Mr President, as our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, reminded us, biocidal products play an essential role, be it in the domestic – and hence private – sphere or in relation to public places. Biocides safeguard our hygiene and health on a daily basis. It is important that we achieve a coherent Community text. It needs to be coherent, first and foremost, with other European legislation. REACH legislation, for example, cannot and must not come into conflict with the regulation on biocides. It is important to avoid administrative and legislative red tape which strangles and suffocates our businesses. On this point, I should like to express my support for the compromise achieved by our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, on the thorny issue of exclusion criteria and candidates for substitution. Similarly, the frame formulation approach for all biocidal products is an essential element of the regulation. It will significantly increase the efficacy of the Community authorisation system. Then, it is a Community text. The introduction of the concept of centralised authorisation in the Union, and the simplification of the procedure and the reduction in the authorisation times for certain tests relating to research and development activities, are two initial positive steps towards the harmonisation of the European market in biocidal products. Finally, we must not lose sight of our ambitions for this text: protection, of course, but the construction of our Community market and European innovation must also be an integral part of our approach.

 I deeply regret the fact that Parliament has adopted the motion for a resolution tabled by the Socialists, Liberals, Greens and Communists regarding the situation of the Roma people in Europe. I feel it is unacceptable to criticise France in that way, since it is not the only Member State to return Roma to their own country. The establishment of certain Roma camps is clearly prejudicial to public order and sometimes even a violation of the right to private property, and the burden it places on our social security system entitles the French Government to take such measures in accordance with the provisions of the European Treaties. The returns to Romania and Bulgaria were carried out in accordance with French and European law and in strict compliance with human rights. I welcome the decision by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to set up a working group on Roma integration in order to find a European solution to the issue of nomadism. We need to take a constructive approach to this subject. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

I approve of the result of the vote on the text referring to the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. It may not be perfect, but the Jeggle report seems to me at least to offer a good compromise; a compromise, moreover, that has won the support of the Eurogroup for Animals. The wording allows us effectively to limit tests causing pain to animals, while avoiding a diversion of research, and hence also of innovation, outside the Union, with the resulting loss of many jobs. As Vice-President of the Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals, I am moreover convinced that it is more valuable to keep animal experimentation on our territory, where it is strictly regulated, than to leave it to third countries, where sanitary conditions and respect for animal life often leave much to be desired.

I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on this very sound text, which has been adopted by a large majority in this House. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Affairs on business registers, I should like to stress the importance of this report. The data on commerce within the European Union are crucial to the positive development and the growth of our single market, and I look forward to the Commission’s legislative proposals on this issue. Mandatory participation of all Member States in a common business register would benefit the entire Union. However, this is possible only if care is taken not to impose additional administrative burdens on our businesses and if private data are kept private, in order to maintain a climate of confidence.

 Mr President, the final agreement which has been reached on the recast of the directives on industrial emissions is more than acceptable, and I welcome the work done to reach a compromise. This final package takes up the key points of the position which I defended with several of my colleagues within the Committee on the Environment, and which was designed to make this text an ambitious, yet realistic, piece of legislation. First, a degree of flexibility is maintained for businesses and for the authorities responsible for granting exemptions. Next, I must applaud the new version of the ESN, which caused so much controversy and which seems much more achievable now that it has been restricted to certain sectors. It is also important to point out that, thanks to the agreement reached, there is a stronger link with the Emission Trading System (ETS) Directive, and the somewhat irrelevant notion of creating an SO2
 and NOx quotas market has been removed once and for all from the text of the new directive. A few reservations should, nevertheless, be borne in mind, and they relate more specifically to the provisions on soils. The Soil Directive is still pending, and unfortunately, this major issue will be addressed only by those Member States which have their own legislation. Tomorrow, Parliament has a duty to adopt the points of the agreement reached at the end of the trialogues. Huge efforts have been made by all concerned to prevent this text from being sent back to the conciliation stage. It is a text which, may I remind you, is crucially important for industry and European environmental policy alike. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 I abstained from voting on the resolution on Israel’s boarding of the Mavi Marmara flotilla. I believe the resolution put forward unbalanced claims and an erroneous version of the facts. I think we need to await the results of the inquiry commission before trying to pass judgment on the Mavi Marmara incident. We must, of course, deplore the loss of human lives but, above all, we must analyse objectively and reasonably the decisions, actions and circumstances that led to this tragedy. Undoubtedly, Israel made political and military errors, but we should nevertheless remember that a naval blockade is a legitimate measure that is recognised by international law in the context of an armed conflict at sea. The blockade, which was put in place to stop arms trafficking in that region at war, was broken through and challenged by the same fleet which is now being presented to the world as the victim of an unjustified Israeli attack. Only a rational dialogue will enable negotiations between Israel and Gaza to move forward. In the framework of that dialogue, Europe is duty-bound to provide a calm, balanced view, without showing any undue partisan fervour. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

I am very pleased with the result of the vote on the Sommer report. The European Parliament has opted for a legible and informative labelling system that will favour balanced consumption patterns. Furthermore, I welcome the adoption of Amendment 205, which will allow for the inclusion of mandatory particulars for meat and meat products derived from animals that have not been stunned prior to slaughter. The consumer needs to be informed of respect for animal welfare practices, practices that are at the heart of European food policy. This is not about stigmatising religious communities or putting their meat production and distribution chain in difficulty, but simply about letting European citizens consume with full knowledge of the facts.

This report on progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals has developed into something that I was unable to support: I considered it was important to vote against the Cashman report as a whole, following the adoption of the second point of paragraph 42 of Mr Cashman’s draft report, which was put to the vote. The lack of clarity regarding the idea behind the expression ‘safe abortion’ was impossible to ignore. Abortion, although necessary in some exceptional circumstances, must not be regarded as a method of contraception. What is more, like all medical procedures, it is never without risk. We must not trivialise it. Development depends first and foremost on respect for life. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Reducing the Israeli­Palestinian conflict to a mere comparison of the number of deaths in one or the other warring camp can only distort our view of this war, which has been going on for too long now. We all agree that it is difficult to find a solution to this conflict, since the causes themselves are complex and deep­rooted. Thus, seeing things in purely black and white terms is impossible in this area of the world. The mission led by Judge Goldstone was tasked solely with listing the violations of international law. Although not all of the conclusions in this report are unjustifiable, voting against these resolutions, which approved the approach and the conclusions of a text that I believe has been managed in a biased fashion but, above all, on the basis of incomplete objectives, struck me as being the most honest intellectual solution. Yes, we do need to denounce and stop the abuses that are committed by one or the other of the warring parties in that region, but we need to be very careful with regard to the procedure used if we want the justice to be established in the region to lead us in the direction of a lasting peace.

Mr President, today there remains less than 15% of the original bluefin tuna stock. In the face of such figures, the solution seems obvious. Nevertheless, we should not forget about the jobs affected by the decision that we are discussing today. It should be pointed out that the aim of the CITES is not to prohibit fishing but merely the international trade in this type of fish, 80% of which is exported to Japan. By protecting tuna, we are certainly protecting an endangered species, but we are also encouraging the continuation of a more balanced and sustainable fishing activity, one that is destined for our internal market and which generates employment. I am in favour of the idea of listing bluefin tuna in Appendix I of the CITES and, while I believe that this decision will be positive, the help of the Commission will be crucial, since it will mean that the fisheries sector can be completely overhauled. My question therefore concerns the conditions of this support. France is requesting an 18-month extension accompanied by financial measures for those fishermen and ship-owners affected by a trade ban. What is the Commission’s view on the subject? Moreover, I, like many of my colleagues, am concerned about fairness. How can we guarantee that boats flying the flag of countries such as Tunisia, Libya and so on will apply the international trade ban as rigorously as we do? What will the new control and penalty measures consist of? Our policy of having sustainable economic activities has to be practical, and sometimes even unpopular in certain sectors, but I hope that the Commission and the Council do not lose sight of the adjustments needed in order to implement these measures.

 Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we no longer need to demonstrate the importance of the issue of climate change. Its short, medium and long-term impacts are undeniable, although the results from the JESC have made the front page of a certain national newspaper and will undoubtedly strengthen the sceptics’ position. The Copenhagen conference appeared to the world to be a unique opportunity for world leaders to bear witness to, act on and correct the effects of this process of climate change. The European Union was a key player at this forum, not only on account of the bold legislation we have passed to limit the impact of our activities on climate, but also because Europe represents a union of countries which can really make a difference. The outcome of the Copenhagen conference has obviously left a feeling of dissatisfaction, but I refuse to call it a failure. The world, including even one of the most reluctant countries, China, has agreed on the issue of limiting the increase in temperature to two degrees. Brazil has just passed a law aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by around 39% by 2020, in line with its undertakings. Many other countries also showed great ambition with regard to greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. I am thinking here of Japan and Norway. I must also highlight the very positive point that was the consensus achieved on the urgent need for a mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation. A specific and unanimous text was produced on the implementation of the so-called REDD+ mechanism to reduce deforestation and enable CO2
 to be stored naturally. Although far from a binding agreement, but clearly along the lines of a political agreement, the outcome of Copenhagen should lead us to question why it was such a disappointment. I attended the Copenhagen conference, as did a number of my fellow Members, with this desire to participate, to help and to see a Europe of negotiation and of leadership take action. I was hugely disappointed because Europe, and particularly Parliament, clearly did not play the role that it deserved to in the negotiations. To make its presence felt, Europe must be seen to be stronger in this area. The meeting of our environment ministers in Seville went nowhere, and our leaders were seen to be unsure and hesitant, and we are still divided over our targets. I hope that Mrs Hedegaard, armed with her proposals and the undertakings she gave before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will be able to restore the ambitions of the European Union.

Freedom of the press is an absolute requirement. A democratic legislative institution like the European Parliament obviously cannot question this benefit. The protection and defence of freedom of information must be guaranteed in all circumstances. Nevertheless, the European Parliament does not have a duty to be a supranational court of justice. Pluralism and freedom of all media must be ensured in the European Union, but it does not behove us as MEPs to judge a country and its leaders on the nature of the relations between the press and the political world. Interference by the European Parliament in this area is unacceptable. What is our legitimacy for issuing any opinion whatsoever on the condition of the Italian media? This is an internal political debate of a Member State, a debate that must be held and resolved inside the frontiers of the State concerned. The rejection of the amendment which intended to change the name of this resolution to give it a more Community-orientated feel demonstrates the targeted and purely political nature of this debate. We must be careful we do not transform our assembly into a court. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Following the vote on the joint resolution on freedom of information in Italy and in the European Union as a whole, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is very satisfied. What we needed to do was to set out clearly the role of the European Parliament: we are a legislative assembly and not a tribunal on the internal affairs of the Member States. It would not have been appropriate for this disguised personal attack to have been supported by Parliament. I am very pleased with the outcome of the vote. Although it was very close, it re-establishes the value of the principle of subsidiarity within the European Union and its institutions. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Providing aid to developing countries is one duty that the European Union must not abandon. The current economic and financial crisis has given a new dimension to globalisation. The idea of a tax on financial transactions was beneficial: President Sarkozy has made it one of his priorities. Europe, it seems, has set the pace and the world has followed. The new, sound workings of international finance will have to be based on fairness. Thus, I regret that the Striffler-Ponga amendment has been rejected, as it proposed a tax on financial transactions to be added to official development assistance, so that the least developed countries could benefit from it. It is true that our economies and our financial systems would have had a greater tax burden, but the European Union would thus have been the initiator of a great international solidarity movement. We can still hope that the resolution adopted here will encourage the Union to honour its commitments and to help developing countries keep pace with globalisation. Christophe Béchu  (PPE

Mr President, I would just like to say that it may be the case that we have not organised our agenda very well today. If having free trade agreements means that we allow products to enter Europe that respect neither our social standards nor our environmental standards, the reform of the common agricultural policy will be pointless. Clearly we cannot continue to take this hypocritical approach where, on the one hand, we impose environmental restrictions relating to health and safety traceability on our farmers, on the grounds that we have to protect consumers, and, on the other hand, we allow products that fail to meet these standards to enter our continent freely. That is precisely the issue being discussed behind the scenes at the negotiations with Mercosur. Although we are being told that Parliament was very well informed and that matters have been as transparent and as clear as possible, the way in which things have been initiated does not give us a good impression of a negotiation that is being held at the same time as other negotiations are taking place at the WTO. For the sake of consistency, and of protecting consumers and our farmers, I feel that we cannot continue down this track. Christophe Béchu  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, there has to be consistency in politics. Over the last few weeks, many of us in this House have demanded measures from the Commission. When solutions are proposed to us, we will vote in favour of those solutions, even if – I agree with what has been said – they are slow in coming and even if they have had to be extracted by means of the positions adopted both within the European Parliament and among ministers. This amount, which will be useful in the very short term, does not resolve, as many have already said, the long-term issues concerning the way in which the planned end of quotas is dealt with. If we want to be in a position to cope with and to prevent repeated crises within the agricultural produce sector, there is no way that we can do so without production regulation and control tools or without a combination of the two. That is not the issue at stake this evening, however. The issue at stake this evening, the only issue that counts at the moment, is that of Article 186. Commissioner, I have one simple question: in concrete terms, what is Article 186 meant to do, and from when and in what way? Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

Improving economic governance must be one of the European Union’s priorities and that is why I supported this report. It is essential to increase the economic dialogue between the Member States and the EU institutions. In that regard, wage increases must be in line with productivity. Moreover, funds must be reallocated to research and innovation to put Europe at the forefront of these sectors. Finally, we need to secure the coherence of the European economic policy in order to generate sustainable growth for future generations. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

I voted in favour of this report because its goal is the adoption of Parliament’s position on the European Union’s draft budget for 2013. It maintains the financial envelope for the food distribution programme for the most deprived persons in the EU and guarantees the appropriations for competitiveness and innovation, in particular, Erasmus Mundus and lifelong learning measures. However, I voted against the paragraphs that were opposed to keeping the European Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

I fully support paragraph 26 of the European Parliament’s resolution on the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020, given the importance of the cohesion policy for the coming years. As the permanent rapporteur for the European Social Fund (ESF), I welcome the fact that the report emphasises the importance of respecting the vote by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to endorse the Commission proposal to earmark 25 % of the total cohesion policy allocation to the ESF. The ESF is the main tool for promoting social integration through professional integration; it is absolutely essential to maintain this tool and increase its use in the period from 2014 to 2020. I therefore call on the Member States to fulfil their responsibilities at November’s European summit. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

 I voted for this report because I want bilateral cooperation between the European Union and Russia that is fairer, whereas at multilateral level Russia has achieved case-by-case liberalisation in some sectors. Russia has agreed to liberalise its trade system as part of its accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). This agreement underlines the scope of its commitments that will not only improve the situation of Russian consumers, who will benefit from better services, it will also provide new business opportunities for EU firms, and for EU exporters and investors already working with Russia. I therefore welcome the fact that Parliament has adopted this report. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this agreement following Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Russia has committed to gradually reduce or remove the export duties that it currently applies to a list of raw materials.

 By voting in favour of this report, I am calling on the Commission to prepare a communication to evaluate and promote the attractiveness of investing in Europe. The economic, financial and budgetary crisis that the European Union is experiencing, high taxation and the economic and social disparities between the Member States and the regions are all factors that are putting a brake on foreign investment in Europe. This situation could deteriorate with growing competition from the emerging economies. The European Union needs to implement a strategy in order better to meet investor expectations.

 Madam President, as we are talking of economic returns in relation to pay equality, I have a question for you: the Member States invest as much in the training of girls as they do in that of boys; it seems to me that, if we followed your argument to its logical conclusion, that has to be a rather poor investment, has it not? That is not a view I share. On the contrary, I believe that we must encourage women’s work and value it. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Ms Bauer for her work, which I fully support. However, secondly, and this request is for you, Commissioner, could you tell Ms Reding that our patience is running out? Today we are in a position where the Charter of Fundamental Rights is being blatantly violated by pay inequalities which trouble no one. I was upset by hearing you say that things had got better because the gap had been reduced from 17.5% to 16.4%. I was upset because I truly believe that Europe has a crucial role to play in showing the Member States the way forward. We must of course respect the equality of citizens before the law; that is a fundamental right and we must ensure it is respected. However, over and above this, what we want is transparency, transparency so that everyone is aware of the real pay gap that exists in our society. The public sector should set an example. SMEs too clearly have a role to play, as does the private sector, but the public sector must also set an example. That is why, when Ms Bauer calls for encouragement and also for sanctions, I think we should support any future legal appeals that women bring against pay disparities. The Member States clearly need to be coerced, private business clearly needs to be coerced, but we also need to coerce the public sector, and we must adopt every possible measure, as Mr Gustafsson said just now, to ensure that women benefit from the pay equality that is achieved. We have had enough. We want growth and, for there to be growth, we need women. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

 By voting for this report, I am supporting the clarification that is needed of the measures to combat imports subject to subsidies by countries not members of the European Union. This report recommends aligning EU measures for combating ‘dumping’ with the recommendations and rulings of the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). This provision will allow us to protect our businesses better against unfair competition on the part of certain foreign companies, and that is why I voted for it. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

 The Commission’s proposal, which enhances legal certainty and improves citizens’ access to European Union legal acts, has been approved by a large majority.

 By voting in favour of this report, I wish to affirm that Europe exists to serve its citizens. Until now, roaming tariffs have been much more expensive than the price of domestic communications, for no good reason. The new EU regulation puts an end to these unfair tariffs by imposing price caps and enabling consumers to choose an operator other than their national operator for roaming services. This regulation represents a great leap forward for European citizens, who will now have more control over their mobile phone bill. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this report, which highlights the importance of greater cooperation between Member States and institutions in the implementation of common core curricula. The report actually encourages them to strengthen their exchanges so as to adapt their curricula to a growing number of students from a wide range of backgrounds. It also calls for the links between higher education institutions to be strengthened so as to allow students to gain initial work experience, on the one hand, and have a choice of teaching that better responds to the specific needs of the labour market, on the other. By voting for this report, I am therefore encouraging the modernisation of our higher education systems to better face up to competition and increase Europe’s competitiveness.

 I welcome the approval of the European Union’s accession to the Offshore Protocol. This attests to the need for increased safety and sustainable governance of oil and gas activities in the Mediterranean. The Barcelona Convention mechanism supplements the commitments made by the EU in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Union for the Mediterranean through the flagship initiative for de-pollution of the Mediterranean, ‘Horizon 2020’. In addition to the ‘sensitive areas’ investment programme for the Mediterranean, supported by the European neighbourhood and partnership instrument, other EU programmes deserve a mention: strengthening the capacities of environmental authorities, systems for sharing information on the environment, sustainable water management, cooperation on urban development and dialogue and various other research projects. It is important for the next multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 to put EU support for de-pollution of the Mediterranean on a long-term footing. The priorities must include combating pollution by plastic residues, which are poisoning marine ecosystems. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 This Parliamentary report presents a balanced and calm approach to a highly controversial subject, and I am pleased about this. I am of the opinion that the choice of energy mix and shale gas extraction permits are of national competence. This conforms to the principle of technological neutrality I defend under the Energy Roadmap 2050. This is why I do not agree with the idea of a European moratorium on shale gas exploration and extraction. Nevertheless, the European Union should draw up, on a European scale, rules that guarantee protection of the environment and high safety levels. At present, hydraulic fracturing poses serious problems that cannot be ignored. Moreover, while there is talk of abundant shale hydrocarbon resources in Europe, no one can say with certainty that the potential is sufficiently promising to envisage industrial exploitation. Therefore, to make enlightened choices, let us continue evaluating the presumed reserves and researching exploration techniques. Let us not close the door on this energy source, in view of the developments on the world energy market and the stakes with regard to competitiveness for Europe. Gaston Franco  (PPE

I voted in favour of the 2013 budget because it maintains the European programme for the most deprived persons. I would stress, however, that this programme must be maintained in the next financial framework for 2014-2020; the challenge is to focus on the long term because the associations need to be visible in order to carry out their missions in full. A year ago, many associations expressed their concern that the funding for the programme had been called into question by the Court of Justice of the European Union, putting the food supply of 18 million people in jeopardy. That situation was unacceptable and it does not reflect the idea of a protective Europe that I defend. Thanks to the mobilisation of many governments, including François Fillon’s Government at that time, an agreement was reached in the Council of the European Union to maintain the programme’s funding for two more years, namely 2012 and 2013. The beneficiaries of the programme can be reassured that the financial envelope of EUR 500 million will certainly be maintained in 2013 and I welcome that. We must continue to strive for a sustainable and satisfactory solution for all of the Member States, the beneficiaries and the contributors. Gaston Franco  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Mr Kariņš, for this difficult report, given the sensitive nature of bilateral negotiations in the field of energy between the Member States and third countries. The agreement reached in trialogue will allow the rapid implementation of the Commission’s draft decision and, wishing to be pragmatic, we cannot but welcome it. Europe of energy is making progress, admittedly slow progress, but nevertheless progress. The European Union relies heavily on imported energy, and is in a position of structural dependence on certain supplier countries. In order for our thinking on our energy strategy to become more European, it therefore became necessary to make information on energy agreements more widely available in the Commission, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity. The establishment of an information exchange mechanism with regard to intergovernmental agreements will therefore ensure greater transparency of the energy market and, thus, allow us to anticipate problems of energy supply. I welcome the fact that this decision does not create obligations as regards agreements between commercial entities. At times of crisis and, given the issues involved in terms of competition and competitiveness, we have a duty to protect our companies’ interests and the safeguards for private contracts. Gaston Franco  (PPE

This text is realistic and ambitious. The proposed regulatory framework is an important step towards achieving the goals set within the energy and climate package, as well as promoting green growth and employment. With the addition of the European sectoral measures on energy efficiency and the provisions taken at national level by Member States, the European Union should therefore be in a position to meet its indicative target for energy efficiency, set at 20% by 2020. It is essential to fight against waste, control energy use and drive innovation, without reducing our production and economic activity. At a time when the issue of energy costs is on everyone’s mind, let us not forget that the best energy is that which we do not consume. Finally, I am particularly pleased with the provisions of the directive which aim to promote heating and cooling efficiency. However, I do regret that the final compromise does not incorporate my amendment aimed at creating a category of cogeneration units between 1 and 20 MW in remote areas that are disadvantaged and have insufficient electricity, in particular where resources are available nearby. This could have helped stimulate decentralised energy production in rural areas. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Member for the quality of his report, which I will support with pleasure. Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, our economy and our industry in Europe depend on resources and raw materials, the prices of which are become increasingly unstable and access to which is becoming uncertain in a context of fierce international competition. These include, for example, rare earths, which are necessary for many new technologies, and of which China holds almost all the mining potential. In order to protect not only our industrial competitiveness but also our environment, it is imperative that we learn how to be less dependent on these resources by developing innovation and recycling. The European Union must move towards a real circular economy, in which extending the life cycle of materials would be a priority, from the product design stage right through to the re-use and recycling of waste. With a view to efficiency, recovering energy from waste must also be promoted. We must also turn to the sustainable exploitation of resources, the potential of which is still too often underestimated. I should like to emphasise the importance of the natural capital represented by forest resources. Timber is a renewable energy source and an ideal, healthy and natural building material. Faced with the dynamism of emerging powers, we must adopt a more proactive and more imaginative attitude in the use of resources so that we can return to growth. The European Union must encourage its enterprises to create more innovative and more sustainable products. It must also exert an influence on the behaviour of consumers by empowering them. I therefore support the experiments in progress on the environmental impact labelling of products, the aim of which is to give Europeans credible information on the environmental impact of their consumption choices. Let us not forget that resources like water, for example, are fragile and precious goods. Gaston Franco,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Leinen, thank you for the work that we have carried out together. The European Union needs a manifesto, a common political vision with regard to the major environmental challenges for 2020 and beyond. That is why it is so useful to launch a 7th Environment Action Programme harmonising the existing financial frameworks and mobilising new funding resources. This programme should ensure that the EU’s environmental strategies are consistent with, and integrated into, sectoral policies, whether these relate to agriculture, fishing, research and innovation, health, transport, regional development or land management and, of course, urban policies. In spite of the economic crisis that has been giving the European Union a hard time, we must not give in to a short-term vision and abandon all ambition in terms of the environment and climate. To do nothing would be fatal. The issues are too important, particularly with regard to efficient resource use and valuing natural capital. We must therefore invest resolutely in the sustainable economy and eco-innovation, which are sources of growth, competitiveness and jobs. It is up to us to promote eco-design and recycling, but also environmental labelling of products in order to avoid waste and poor consumption choices. We cannot overlook this environmental lesson that European citizens need. The Environment Action Programme is a political programming instrument, but it is also a communication tool. It must provide the readability and predictability that is necessary not only for national and local authorities and citizens, but also for entrepreneurs and investors with regard to the European Union’s environmental choices. European regulation must not become a punishment or a vice. Gaston Franco  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that this amending budget concerning the financing of ITER was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Budgets on 29 March. By financing this cost overrun, we avoid scrapping a fundamental strategic research project in which the European Union has a leading role, and we honour our international commitments. Let us remember that none of the seven partners of the EURATOM community has questioned its overall contribution to the project. Japan, despite the drama of Fukushima, decided to honour its budgetary commitments in ITER to the full. Without this agreement, hundreds of researchers would have had to suspend their work and the ITER project would have suffered detrimental delays. Today, 1 000 people work for ITER in Cadarache. In the period from 2015 to 2017-2018, the building construction and machine assembly phase saw between 4 000 and 5 000 people deployed on this site. In conclusion, Mr President, ITER is a project Europe can take pride in and a symbol of our excellence. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 I welcome the motion for a resolution adopted by the European Parliament ahead of the forthcoming climate change conference in Durban. It is vital that we reach an international, legally binding agreement. We call on the European Union to confirm its strong commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and to show its unequivocal support for a second commitment period post-2012. The EU must formally invite all of its international partners to do the same, in order to achieve the objectives set by the Kyoto Protocol, namely reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting global warming linked to climate change to 2°C. This resolution has allowed us to turn the spotlight on a subject that is very close to my heart: improving forest management as a prerequisite for reducing deforestation. In particular, we have emphasised the need to implement the mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). Parliament has thus sent a strong message aimed at the establishment of a proper mechanism for combating deforestation, which accounts for some 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Given the extent of the European and international disasters that we have faced, such as the tsunami in 2004, Haiti in 2010 and Fukushima in 2011, it is high time that Europe had an effective system to ensure a rapid response to disasters. That is why I welcome the adoption of this report, which is the first step towards a harmonised, organised and united response from the European Union. I tabled a number of amendments, which were adopted in the final report, to emphasise the importance of prevention in crisis management and the organisation of this prevention through operational tools, which I welcome. Until more thought has been given to the establishment of any real future European civil protection force, I think that the creation of a European emergency response centre will simplify the current European Civil Protection Mechanism. I called for this European centre to be equipped with two Community tools to protect forests from forest fires, EFFIS and EFFICS, which was adopted in the final report. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 As the rapporteur for the opinion of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I would like to congratulate Carlo Fidanza on his excellent report, which is a foundation stone for a true European strategy to stimulate and complement the Member States’ action in the tourism field. Tourism is a key industry, and a source of growth and job creation. Europe needs tourism that is in phase with the modern world, the changes in world demand and the changes in our societies. We need tourism that is innovative and competitive but that also respects the environment, local cultures and local conditions. In a context of international competition between destinations, we have everything to gain from promoting our assets, our trades and our know-how, and from better communicating our unique European and national features. Therefore, the recent creation of a festival of French gastronomy celebrated on the first day of autumn is an excellent initiative that we should welcome. Sustainable tourism, cultural tourism, business and conference tourism, health tourism: these are the priorities. We should also establish Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in the tourism field in the wake of the Arab Spring. We need to make every effort together to bring prosperity to the Mediterranean on the basis of common standards and projects. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 I welcome the adoption of this own-initiative report aimed at improving the safety of offshore oil and gas platforms. Following the Gulf of Mexico disaster, I voiced my support for an improvement in safety in order to prevent a repeat of this kind of disaster, which not only endangers marine ecosystems but also severely affects the economic sectors of fishing and tourism. Parliament has voted in favour of stricter controls by independent experts and of the adoption of contingency plans prior to each operation, which I believe is an effective and proportionate response to the need to improve the safety of these platforms. Parliament has also referred to the industry’s liability in the event of a disaster, in accordance with the polluter pays principle, but without overlooking the supervisory and coordinating role that the public sector must play. I am pleased that my political group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), has insisted that no moratorium be imposed on the subject. Indeed, the introduction of a moratorium on all new deep-sea oil drilling in EU waters would be a disproportionate reaction to the need to ensure high safety standards across the EU.

 I welcome the adoption of this report, which is undoubtedly a step towards an EU energy policy promoting the successful interconnection of energy networks between Member States across national and regional borders. In order to address major challenges in the development and security of energy infrastructure in Europe, the European Parliament wished to adopt an own-initiative report in anticipation of the legislative proposal concerning a new European instrument in this field. Interconnection capacity or its availability between Member States still remains insufficient in one-third of the Union. Modernisation, cross-border interconnection and timely adaptation of energy infrastructure are essential to achieving the energy objectives for 2020, especially those concerning the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix of Member States. Market-based tools and the user-pay principle should remain the basis for financing energy infrastructure. However, the rapporteur realistically identified criteria defining projects ‘of European interest’ likely to obtain public finance, which has to result in an innovative mix of financial instruments that levers private investment.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about improving the safety of nuclear power, not about calling civil nuclear power into question when it is an essential component of energy independence and of the fight against greenhouse gases in many Member States of the European Union. The European initiative of performing stress tests on all our power stations is a first essential and reasonable step which responds to the expectations of European citizens. We must carry out these tests using a common approach and common criteria whose methodology will have to be entrusted to the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group. The neighbouring countries of the European Union should also undergo these tests, given the cross-border risks that exist. Besides these tests, the European Union must work to harmonise international standards at the highest level, within the G20 and the International Atomic Energy Agency, on the basis of the Western European Nuclear Regulators’ Association’s objectives for new reactors. Within the European Union, we should promote and intensify cooperation between the national safety authorities. The European Union must serve as a model, both for the strengthening of the rules and for efforts in solidarity. In the face of this type of disaster, I think that the creation of a European Civil Protection Force is needed more than ever. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 I am delighted that, after five years of negotiations, Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) have been concluded with Cameroon and with the Republic of the Congo. These agreements will help ensure good forest governance by granting FLEGT licences to timber products from these countries and thus guaranteeing the sustainable exploitation and management of their forests. It is essential to have a system by which to monitor movements of timber and derived products from harvesting right up to export. Twenty to thirty per cent of world industrial timber production is illegal, as is 60% of the harvesting that has taken place in Africa over the last 10 years. These VPAs will therefore help preserve the forests in these countries by combating illegal harvesting, which causes significant environmental, economic and social damage. The main advantage of these VPAs is that they will apply to all exports between the EU and these countries, together with all other timber importing countries. I hope that this VPA system will be rolled out quickly to other forest countries. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is quite rightly asking itself whether an oil disaster such as the one that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico could happen in our waters. Since oil spills have destroyed our coasts and left a lasting impression on us numerous times in the past, we quite rightly believe that the preservation and protection of marine ecosystems, animal biodiversity and the economic sectors of fishing and tourism are of paramount importance. However, we must keep a cool head and resist adopting an extreme position which the introduction of a moratorium on any further deep-water oil drilling in Europe would represent. Firstly, because we have very strict safety standards for exploitation and exploration in Europe. Furthermore, national regulators and oil companies in Europe have themselves pledged to amend the exploitation and safety rules and procedures if the outcome of the US investigation into the disaster so demands. Secondly, in view of our requirement for energy independence, it would be highly risky, from a geostrategic point of view, to abandon our North Sea drilling operations. Ultimately, it is the future of our oil industry that we are jeopardising if we shut down its exploration and extraction activities. How could we justify the consequent impact on employment growth in a time of crisis? Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Nowadays, 20-30% of industrial timber production worldwide is from illegal sources. We need to clean up the European timber market as soon as possible. While it could still be improved, the proposed regulation is ambitious and courageous. In my view, it is an effective tool for limiting rampant deforestation, without imposing administrative constraints on our European companies or harming timber, which will, on the contrary, become more highly valued. The regulation establishes a binding provision which delegates responsibilities on the basis of the ‘due diligence system’. This allows operators to trace timber and timber products, to access information on observance of the applicable legislation and, thus, to obtain sufficient guarantees to prevent the sale of products from logging considered to be illegal. The obligations contained in the regulation must target those operators who place timber on the market for the first time, because that is when there is the most risk. Furthermore, in order to guarantee that this regulation is effective, we should emphasise the need for regular controls and a system of stringent, deterrent penalties for offenders.

I am surprised by the absence of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy from the scene of the natural disaster in Haiti. In spite of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union still has difficulty in showing its face on the international stage, and that is most regrettable. It seems to me that the European crisis response system is too fragmented, too complex and not successful enough. In terms of the rehabilitation of Haiti (for which EUR 100 million are earmarked) and the reconstruction of the country (EUR 200 million), what exactly will the EDF and the Stability Instrument fund? Furthermore, to respond to the UN request in terms of logistical and security support, the European Union must, in my view, be in a position to use all the instruments provided by the Treaty of Lisbon, including military response. I call for the rapid establishment of a European civil protection force as devised by Mr Barnier in 2006 with the aim of arriving at a European response that is planned, genuinely coordinated and effective. The recent statements by Mr Van Rompuy are along the right lines. He advocated the creation of a humanitarian rapid reaction force.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this summer, once again, the Mediterranean forest was engulfed in flames: in Marseille and in southern Corsica, but also in Italy, in Spain and, on a larger scale, in Greece. More than 400 000 hectares of forest and field went up in smoke, causing considerable material damage, irreparable damage to biodiversity, and the tragic loss of human lives. Dismayed as I am by this assessment made repeatedly, year after year, and mindful as I am of the multiplier effect of global warming on fires, I call for European awareness of the need for more coordinated efforts and for the pooling of fire-fighting resources. I should like to see a huge Euro-Mediterranean cooperation project to combat forest fires take shape under the Union for the Mediterranean. I welcome the existing initiatives and, in particular, the European Forest Fire Information System – the pilot project. Nevertheless, I call for a reform of the European Union Solidarity Fund so that it will become an effective tool for responding to crises. I also call for the strengthening of the European protection force and of the ‘EuropeAid’ facility devised by Mr Barnier in 2006 for intervention on the territory of the 27 Member States, as well as abroad. I believe that one of the keys to the problem of forest fires has to do with information sharing and best practice as regards prevention, and I should like to point out the pioneering role played by the forest fire fighters in my own department. I can, of course, provide Europe with this example, which may be of use. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

. − Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report today is an assessment of what is now a significant part of European economic governance. I would like to thank the group rapporteurs, with whom I was able − and this is not just words − to undertake genuine constructive work. I believe that this report, taken overall, reflects the concerns of everyone, even if not all have been taken up in a strict sense.  This report was also undertaken in close cooperation with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in accordance with Rule 50, which explains why the report takes up a number of provisions in their entirety, without a vote, so as to properly respect those rules and the ideas of that committee; the rules prevailed. I am not going to list the various points we are emphasising in terms of the Semester content; I would rather talk about what concerned us the most, namely the method. The Semester is, as I was saying, a very important element in establishing coordination of States’ economic and financial policies and involves both European and national levels. That is already something new. In fact, while the Commission’s proposals must next be validated by the Council before being reflected, as far as possible, in national budgets, there is a need, in terms of democratic control, for sound understanding and proper coordination with national parliaments. In this regard, we know − and I do not think anyone will mind me saying − that some of our national parliaments do not fully understand Community Mechanisms and there is a certain apprehension when they see the European level take precedence over national level. That is why some, quite legitimately, assert that national sovereignty entitles them to adopt the budget they want and that they do not have to obey instructions or orders from elsewhere. There is, therefore, undoubtedly work to be done to educate and explain. Indeed, a meeting was recently held in Brussels with the representatives of the financial or economic committees of the national parliaments to explain this European Semester. I had the opportunity, as rapporteur, to say that MEPs have no intention whatsoever of interfering in national relations or the working of national parliaments and that, in reality, the European Parliament and national parliaments have a specific task, that of providing democratic control at their level. I think that in future such meetings will have to be repeated to encourage understanding of the system and its proper application. In this regard, it would certainly be a good thing for these meetings, currently organised in a fairly ad hoc way, to be more formal and, in particular, for those attending the meetings to be able to do so regularly, so that genuine dialogue may be established between national parliaments and the European Parliament. On issues of method, we also stress the need, for instance, for recommendations to be more explicit so that outcomes may be evaluated and, if necessary, corrected. Lastly, I will add that it is also important for States to meet the commitments they have themselves made. It seems an obvious thing to say but, unfortunately, the opposite is often seen. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur
. − Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for passing on our observations to Mr Rehn, but he had taken the trouble of telephoning me yesterday to explain that he would be detained elsewhere today and I was grateful to him for doing so. Sometimes our debates are accused of being simply a string of words with no discernible direct impact on the work presented by the rapporteur. I would like, today, to try to prove the opposite and to respond to those Members − I thank all those who have spoken − who made a request. As regards Ms Trautmann’s request, I will give very serious consideration to withdrawing Amendments 4 and 5. Of course, I have to talk to my Group, since I am a loyal ordinary foot soldier; but I will do all I can to please you and to follow the recommendation made to me, by telephone, by my friend Mr Lamassoure. As regards the reference to the Fiscal Stability Treaty, there is a paragraph where we had fun but, strictly speaking, this reference is not of any consequence. In addition, we could be accused of talking about intergovernmentalism in a Union text; I will therefore also ask the Group for authority to remove paragraph 23 entirely. I hope that, in this way, the excellent cooperative work undertaken during preparation of this report may continue until the vote and thus show Parliament’s determination to make the European Semester a highly effective exercise. In this regard, I would like to say to Ms Zuber –
 I am a little sorry, Commissioner Barnier also just answered her –
 but it seems to me that we are not living in a time bubble and, without European solidarity, I dare not think what would be happening in some countries today. I think that has to be taken into account. Europe is not in the process of oppressing countries in difficulty. I think, on the contrary, that it is endeavouring to help them. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, to start with, I would of course like to congratulate you and thank you for the extremely thorough and very expeditious work that you have carried out to introduce the two proposals that are here before us today. We shall play a different role in each of them, which will also be dependent on the legal basis. However, Commissioner, I feel, when I listen to what each of you has to say and read the newspapers, that these negotiations are fraught with danger, because people’s opinions are different. The commitments entered into are not clear. Yet, we are currently being watched closely by our fellow citizens, who want to understand and see what Europe is doing, by our entrepreneurs, who want to know if they can invest, and by the markets, which are anxious to know what to do. I believe that, in the coming months and weeks, the direction that the negotiations take will be a determining factor. I shall not go into technical details here, as they will be the subject of the debate, but I shall merely observe that, unless we show a real European spirit, unless we show that we can set aside short-term national interests and unless we are able to put in place genuinely robust European institutions, all our work will be to no avail and cause disappointment. I am confident in your determination, Commissioner, which I know to be unflagging. You have a record that does credit to you and, therefore, we can say that luck is on our side. It is now up to the Member States to shoulder their responsibilities and rise above squabbles over technical matters. The issue is not how we share out one minor competence or another. The real issue is whether we are able to create banking union, or at least a quality prudential control system, to put finance at the service of the economy. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). -  
(FR) 
Mr President, I am talking about the rule on blue-card questions. You have just made the observation that I wished to make. I wanted to know whether, on the subject of banking Union, we were not perhaps spectators at an island ping-pong competition. I believe that the system which consists of hijacking the use of blue-card questions by asking questions to friends of one's own group, thereby increasing one's speaking time, is essentially a poor use of the procedure. I am astonished that this should come from a country where fair play is generally held in high esteem. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, I would like to thank my colleagues for their support and I propose that the report be referred back to committee so that we can start the trialogue discussions and try to reach an agreement at first reading. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Minister, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to recap on why this report has come back to the plenary sitting today, after having been adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). The regulation on countries experiencing difficulties, for which I was rapporteur, was adopted by 25 votes to 4, with 13 abstentions. The abstentions were primarily by the Socialists. However, they did vote in favour of most of the amendments and all of the compromise amendments. Before opening the negotiations, which, from what we have been hearing from the Presidency, will not be easy, I felt it was important to obtain a more solid mandate from plenary. When the time comes, therefore, I will ask that we do not proceed with the vote on the legislative resolution so that, if applicable, we can secure an agreement at first reading. This draft regulation on strengthening economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability in the euro area is set against the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis that the European Union is facing and will continue to face. The Union is trying to learn lessons from the crisis, and to propose solutions. The Commission’s proposals complement the package on economic governance: the ‘six-pack’ adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2011. Excessive national debt can have dramatic consequences, both within the countries concerned and for the other Member States of the European Union. The difficulties of a small country can even have global repercussions. What is at risk is the euro area’s reputation, rather than its existence. The serious economic and social consequences that some Member States are experiencing today could have been avoided if early, targeted action had been taken. At the time, the European Union did not have the necessary instruments, but this will now be put right by the combination of the ‘six-pack’ and two new pieces of legislation (the ‘two-pack’), including this one. The ‘six-pack’ needs to be strengthened, in order to ensure both financial stability and economic growth in the euro area. Several Member States have had to seek financial assistance. Preventive action at an early stage is preferable to corrective measures taken later – perhaps too late – in the proceedings. The broad thrust of the draft regulation adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is in line with the original proposal, which provides for a Member State whose currency is the euro to be subject to enhanced surveillance when it is experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, severe financial disturbance. It should be swiftly returned to a normal situation and the other euro area Member States should be protected against possible negative spillover effects. The regulation sets out clear procedures to this effect for countries experiencing difficulties. The parliamentary committee was keen to increase the powers that the original proposal gave the Commission, in particular, by introducing wider use of the reverse qualified majority rule in Council votes. For example, this rule would apply when the Commission recommends that a country should take corrective measures, or when it instructs a country to submit new debt reduction plans. Such decisions would be deemed to have been adopted unless the Council categorically rejected them. It is worth mentioning that ECON adopted the protection system for States in major difficulties by a wide majority. I would like to point out that there were no negotiations on this amendment and that the vote was left to each individual’s judgment. A majority of our Members chose not to heed the arguments put forward by detractors of this proposal, which were partly based on a distorted presentation of its objective. The intention is not to organise a restructuring or reduction of the debt, but to allow the State to get itself back into shape so that it can deal with its obligations. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, in view of the time, we have to avoid making very long speeches. I would just like to mention to the Commissioner that I share his concern that we should move swiftly and thereby show how effective the community method is. I would like to tell the President-in-Office of the Council, who really could not care less, that it is our firm intention to gain a large majority vote here and to start the trialogue. Before the debate began this morning, there was the matter of Schengen and the Danish Presidency. I hope that on this subject, you will show that you are able to take Parliament’s opinions into account. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Mr President, this tax has caused quite a stir, and we have seen how some of our colleagues have engaged in mudslinging before immediately leaving the debate. I would like to simply reiterate the fact that Parliament has already made its position regarding this tax very clear through several resolutions and decisions. I think that the important thing today is effective implementation, because we are sustaining the report with a whole series of plans, a whole series of words and, behind it, nothing much is happening. In my opinion, it is important for us to be realistic. Since this is a tax matter, Parliament is only being consulted on this report and, in view of this, I feel we must be clear and concise when stating our views. The Commission’s proposal is interesting and good, and I believe we should support it. We must not try to weaken it; there are already strong disagreements within the Council and the chances of seeing the success of this report as we wish, at EU level, are relatively slim. That is why some people suggest that we work in closer cooperation. That is one of the ideas. Parliament is only consulted on this subject, but we should put all the necessary efforts in place. The position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is clear. After discussions and equivocations, the PPE Group is, today, in favour of the financial transaction tax. We would like the tax to be as comprehensive as possible, but, as the PPE Group is realistic, we know that this is not possible in the current climate. We would like the tax to be adopted at European level and that it not be implemented at a lower level, as this would certainly be detrimental to the European financial economy. We must not look the other way: if there were no European internal market – the European market forms a single entity and, personally, I do not believe in running away from things – if it falls to a lower geographical level, there is a real risk.

 Mr President, Mr Fox, we should always be optimistic. Anything can happen. They may see the light. I think that when faced with reality, with the problems of the economic crisis and the need to obtain financial means in a fair way, and also to avoid speculation and ensure the reform of financial activity, everyone can see that this tax would be useful. To reiterate my view, I would like this tax to be established at European Union level. If is it necessary to go in at a lower level, it must not go too low geographically, so as not to create distorted competition, which would be detrimental. I hope that the Member States who are not currently in favour of it will see the light. I am counting on Mr Šemeta’s conviction to drive this report forwards, and I encourage him to do so. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Commissioner, alongside the recovery of public finances, the question of growth is key to the success of the European strategy. In this regard, what is to be the role of the European Central Bank, which has shown extraordinary creativity during the financial crisis? Make no mistake. It is not a matter of making some completely unrealistic revision to the treaty. It is, in reality, about creating political conditions for the ECB to take the action it has undertaken further by buying sovereign debt on the secondary market and injecting liquidity into the financial system. Experience shows that this is possible within the existing legal framework without undermining the independence of the ECB or backtracking on its objectives. It is a question of European solidarity and political will, and not of legal provisions. However, recovery of public finances and prevention of the risk of crises remain a priority. Economic governance of the euro area is being strengthened. Mechanisms for the detection, prevention and sanction of abuses have been reinforced by the ‘six-pack’ initiative. The ‘two-pack’ initiative is under negotiation and there must be a conclusion on this subject soon. This negotiation must particularly make it possible to develop effective, practical measures for the benefit of Member States in difficulty or whose deficits are excessive. In this regard, we must ensure that democratic control is exercised as normal at European level to make the steps to be taken in this area acceptable to the people, the citizens. I would like to conclude by stressing that it would be desirable for the Commission’s proposal to be supplemented by legal protection for any Member State in extreme difficulty – not to encourage complacency but, on the contrary, to allow them to recover and meet their obligations. This provision should be controlled by the Commission under the supervision of the Council and Parliament. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the draft directive aims to implement within the European Union a common consolidated corporate tax base, known as the CCCTB. This has been under discussion since 2004. Today, Parliament, having been asked for its opinion and by way of Marianne Thyssen’s report, wishes – or in any case, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wishes – to send a strong message encouraging the Commission to continue its work in this area. The implementation of a CCCTB in the European Union offers many benefits, both for economic operators – by removing tax obstacles from the internal market – and for Member States – by enabling more transparent and therefore healthier tax competition between Member States. The report, voted through by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and presented by Ms Thyssen, is excellent. After lengthy negotiations and skilful identification of how best to address a very delicate issue, that is to say, the voluntary or optional nature of the system, she is proposing – and has reached agreement on – a phased transition, with the regime becoming immediately compulsory for European companies and cooperatives, to be extended to all companies with the exception of SMEs after five years, following review by the Commission. Commissioner, I believe the Commission should be more demanding in this area. I know the proposal is not strongly supported by several Member States, either due to a principled opposition, such as that of the United Kingdom, to complete tax harmonisation, or due to fears that would be provoked by implementation of this system. This is the stance of Poland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, for example. It must be disregarded. It is crucial for the European Union that this consolidated base, which does not involve a harmonisation of taxes, is implemented. That is the view taken of your proposal by the PPE Group. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, President Van Rompuy, first of all, let me congratulate you on your reappointment, Mr Van Rompuy. I am among those who, since you were first appointed, have been trying to explain to citizens that your task is a difficult one. I hope that you will continue to execute it with just as much persistence. I know that it is difficult. Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about citizens. I am sorry to have to say today that Europe is losing its credibility. I will not get involved in the national electoral battle: this is neither the time nor the place for that. One may, however, ask why such statements may be publicly accepted. Due to the fact that they are not rejected by public opinion, they are adopted by a very large majority simply because our fellow citizens no longer have any faith in Europe. It may be possible to exercise faith in certain areas. However, I believe that for Europe, what we need is reality. Today, I admire all those who, every month, or every week, make their speeches once again to say the same thing, and I pity those who write them, because what our citizens are looking for is action, and not words. We should spend less time speaking and more time taking action. Today, there are various causes behind the weakening of Europe. The first is, clearly, the way that the crisis has led to nations turning in on themselves. Each country is seeing things only from its point of view, looking at what is going on nationally without taking into account the European dimension, which is the only one that might save us. The second cause is the weakening of the Commission. The Commission appears silent. I am not saying that the Commission is not doing anything: it is working, but no one notices what it is actually doing because there is no clear plan. What is missing is a small package of specific actions that would allow citizens to compare what has been announced with what has been done. Let us take the case of Greece. It is very clear that Greece’s situation is tragic. Why are we giving the impression that it has now been resolved? It has not. One problem has been resolved to allow the plan to work, but in another year or two, problems will arise once again, because strong measures need to be taken. In addition, in the ‘two-pack’ that has been mentioned, I am proposing a safeguard measure for countries in difficulty. However, I was told by the Commission that it was an attack on the market. In fact, when you talk to the markets, what they want is to know where we are going and how we are getting there. They want to stick with the measures that have been taken, and not to change them every fortnight. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, first of all, I would like to say here that I think what is in the treaty could very well appear in European law, and on this point I believe I am in agreement with the Commission. This was said just now by President Barroso, when he stated that the Commission is making proposals to include a number of parties. Therefore, I do not intend to withdraw anything at all. I believe that we need rigour. Only a fool builds his house on the sand. If we now want to get the situation back on track, we must simultaneously balance rigour and growth. Growth, however, is not to be sought in newspaper articles or theories. Growth must be found in innovation, in entrepreneurship, in the mobilisation of entrepreneurs and in confidence. That is what we should work on together. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, every year, the Annual Growth Survey allows us to define the European Union’s economic and budgetary priorities and actions. I should first like to thank the Commission for having published its report before the end of November, thus allowing Parliament to carry out, in good time, some painstaking work. We would like this schedule to become permanent, so that Parliament has time enough to express its views before annual economic guidelines are decided upon by the Spring European Council. This year, on the occasion of the review of this report, Parliament wishes to strongly urge Member States to implement effectively those measures required by the policies that they themselves have undertaken to pursue. Obviously, the primary aim of these measures should be to find a way out of the sovereign debt crisis. They should go hand in hand with a growth strategy based on improving competitiveness. It is clearly also important to promote a sustainable economy which creates jobs. Parliament agrees with the Commission’s analysis that efforts at national and EU level should concentrate on the following five priorities: pursuing differentiated growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, while ensuring economic recovery and job creation; ensuring long-term financing of the real economy; promoting sustainable growth through more competitiveness and investments; tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis, and, finally, modernising EU public administration and services of general interest. As regards fiscal consolidation, Member States should pursue differentiated strategies according to their budgetary situations and keep their public expenditure growth below the rate of medium-term trend GDP growth. Member States must prioritise, on the expenditure and revenue sides of the budget, growth-friendly policies, particularly in the areas of education, research, innovation, infrastructure and energy, and ensure the efficiency of such expenditures and revenues. As regards ensuring the long-term financing of the real economy, Parliament welcomes the determined efforts by Commissioner Barnier to overhaul the regulation and supervision of the financial sector. If investor confidence is to be restored, the banks’ capital positions must be strengthened and measures must be taken to support their access to funding. Thirdly, the promotion of sustainable growth presupposes an increase in the competitiveness of investments. In this respect, Parliament is worried by the macro-economic imbalances within the EU and the fact that many Member States are falling behind in terms of productivity. Enhanced coordination of economic policies as well as structural reforms are needed to tackle these problems in both deficit and surplus countries in an adequate way. Modernising EU public administration and services of general interest is also a determining element of competitiveness and an important productivity factor. In future, Parliament wishes to be more closely involved in drawing up the main political and economic guidelines. It should be noted that the European Semester is now part of EU secondary legislation. The economic governance legal framework provides the tool of economic dialogue to enhance the dialogue between the EU institutions and to ensure greater transparency. We are anxious for this to be so, and I shall conclude shortly after the various speeches to be made, in the two minutes that remain to me, Mr President. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, this is certainly not the best time to speak. However, I, too, would like to commend the excellent cooperation between the rapporteurs, Ms Cornelissen, Ms Berès and myself and the shadow rapporteurs. On the substance of the debate, I would like to say that what is needed today is for words to be backed up by actions, and that is undoubtedly the hardest thing to achieve. As regards its form, I would like to point out that the 2012 European Semester will be the first to come under the new legal framework of enhanced economic governance. In order to ensure that Parliament is well informed, we urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the Commission provides a detailed assessment of the implementation, by the Member States, of the recommendations in each country. The Council, for its part, is required to provide a public explanation of its position within the framework of economic dialogue with Parliament, when its position deviates significantly from the Commission’s recommendations and proposals. It is quite clear that the States can retain a degree of discretion under the principle of subsidiarity. The new legal framework stipulates that Parliament must be duly involved in the European Semester in order to increase transparency and accountability for decisions, particularly through economic dialogue, as provided for by the relevant secondary legislation. In this respect, I should like to conclude by reminding you of the requests made by Parliament to the Council and the Commission in its resolution of 1 December 2011. It is important to give this resolution a precise public response. The reality and effectiveness of the democratic control for which this Parliament is responsible depends on it. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you know how much I appreciate your actions and everything you are doing. The issue we are dealing with this evening is important. It happens that I was rapporteur for the directive on payment services in the previous mandate. I therefore know how important it is to work towards harmonising payment services across Europe. This evening, allow me simply to discuss one issue which angers people: multilateral interchange fees. From the beginning, I have defended these fees and I had the opportunity to do so when we launched the first SEPA transfer in 2007. Interchange fees are legitimate. What is not legitimate is setting them at rates which are excessively high. Why are these fees legitimate? They are legitimate because payment services are a commercial service. The institutions, that is, banks or payment institutions established under Title II of the directive I mentioned just a moment ago, must undertake commercial activity. It is therefore normal that they should receive remuneration. This must obviously be justified by the service provided and, from this point of view, interchange fees — it is true — were, for a certain period of time, set unduly high. However, today, things have changed and the situation we are arriving at thanks to this new text, this regulation, is something of a paradox. Firstly, this text regulates an issue which was under discussion in the Court of Justice of the European Union; it authorises interchange fees at national level until 2017. It bans them sooner for cross-border operations but allows interchange fees to operate if payment is refused or rejected. None of that is very consistent. We must not let what has been done this time serve as an example for the coming regulation on bank cards. Reflection must be better led in this area and the fact that only six countries have resorted to using interchange fees does not mean to say that they are useless. Why? Because otherwise there is no transparency; we would pay for payment services using other means of payment, for example, cheques. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Madam President, Commissioner, Ms Matera, may I say, first of all, that we fully support Ms Matera’s line of argument concerning whether or not the decision to end the crisis derogation was justifiable, and I would like to thank her for all the work she has carried out in this area. I also share your view, Commissioner, on the disastrous impact it will have on the EU’s image if this measure is stopped despite its proven effectiveness. I should like to return briefly to the Renault case – and I also speak on my behalf of my colleague Mr Riquet, who is unable to be here today for personal reasons – in order to say that I also share your assessment of this issue. This case has had its ups and downs, no doubt due to the fact that two aspects have been mixed up: the question of which measures are eligible under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), and the strictly French issue of voluntary early retirement. As you said, there has been a kind of overlapping between the initial agreement and pension reform in France, which extended the period during which workers have to contribute, leaving a number of workers – the number of these varies, as does the time frame – concerned about their future. We share that concern, and it so happens that both Mr Riquet and I are deputies for the constituencies where the affected Renault factories are located. I can assure you that we have spared no effort in trying to encourage Renault to see reason. Just yesterday, I spoke on the phone to the head of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Health, who read Renault’s commitments to me. I believe they are serious about those commitments, but I can guarantee that, at local level, we will make every effort to make sure that the workers affected by this pensions problem – which you said is not directly part of this issue – can see a proper solution to their situation. On the basis of these observations I would call on all my colleagues to grant this assistance to Renault. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 I did not realise that this was what the Commission was proposing. My understanding is that the Commissioner said that he regretted this decision and was going to ensure that borderline cases could be studied in accordance with the criteria in force, but taking account of this crisis situation, which, he said – it seems to me – was going to continue and was going to continue to affect unemployment, unfortunately. That is why I said just now that I was in full agreement with the analysis of the Commissioner and the rapporteur on these matters and that this decision by the Council conveyed entirely the wrong message and gave Europe a very bad image in a difficult period for workers.

 Explanations were given to me just yesterday afternoon by the French Ministry of Labour, the Minister of which was taking steps to enable progress to be made on this issue under, it seems to me, less than pleasant conditions. The issue of pensions has in fact arisen in other French companies and has been resolved, notably at Michelin, for example, which does not come across as an allegedly left-leaning company. What is shocking – and I want to make this clear here and now – is that Renault, 17% of the capital of which is held by the government, has expressed some reservations. However, yesterday I wanted to make sure that these commitments had been made. These commitments – which were read out to me over the telephone, but which I did not get in writing – aim to ensure that people who do not receive an income because of an increase in the necessary contribution periods as a result of pension reform in France can have their contribution shortfalls compensated for, in particular through offers of temporary work. However, on humane grounds, this solution does not seem to me to be very satisfactory. That is why I said that, at local level – because I am in contact with the prefect of the region, and I am fully prepared to work with Ms Grelier to resolve this issue – I believe that, despite our political differences, we both have the same concern that workers who lose their jobs, who entered into an agreement contractually concluded when the situation was different, do not have their rights eroded because of subsequent changes to the legislation. I am perfectly willing to fight this fight, along with Ms Grelier, but I hope it will not come to that. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, of course, I shall say, like most of my fellow Members, that the Polish Presidency has been a success, and has worked effectively over a difficult period. However, contrary to what has just been said, perhaps the high point of this Presidency is the speech looking back over it that you have just given, Prime Minister. You encouraged us with utmost lucidity and a sense of realism – let me remain within the atmosphere of yesterday evening’s Polish Christmas dinner – to examine our consciences. This is something that we do less and less. Everyone shows their satisfaction, self-satisfaction or indulges in self-praise while you, today, asked some hard questions. However, the European Parliament also needs to examine its conscience. It is not enough to demand greater powers, greater cooperation and greater presence. We, too, have to be capable of a rapid and effective response if we are to survive within our institutional environment. I think that we shall have the opportunity to do so over the next few days with the growth report. I happen to have been tasked with the own-initiative report and we are going to suggest that Parliament be allowed to intervene and make proposals in relation to the Commission’s proposals, either to support them or to suggest new approaches. Today, the time has come to have a renewed democracy and Parliament must have a place within it. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this work that has just been done deserves to be highlighted and also deserves to be recognised for what it is. The work that has been done is an example of excellent cooperation with the rapporteur, Ms Berès, and I believe that tomorrow’s vote will show that it expresses the will of the vast majority of this House. Why is this the case? Because at stake here is the democratic scrutiny of procedures aimed at improving economic integration and cooperation among States. Clearly, Parliament is not asking to be an executive, nor is it asking to take the place of the national parliaments. However, everyone has a part to play at his or her respective level. The merit of this own-initiative report, which is perhaps a little longer than normal, is that it proposes practical solutions for this association, by adopting two points of view. Firstly, the point of view of the current Treaty, of the current rules. The rapporteur makes proposals on how to increase Parliament’s involvement so as to ensure democratic scrutiny. However, the report also reflects on the possibility of amending the Treaties and, at that point, indicates the improvements or the changes that should be made to guarantee this effective democratic scrutiny, which guarantees the legitimacy of the measures taken and negotiated at European and individual Member State levels. I should like to return to two specific points that were raised a moment ago, starting with the subcommittee on the euro. We have abandoned it so as not to create a divide among MEPs, but this report rightly points out that, when the time comes, Parliament will have to adapt to the structure adopted by the Member States within the Council or within the euro area. There is also the quasi-legislative, or quasi-codecision, issue. We must be practical and implement, on the basis of the Annual Growth Survey, a mechanism that allows Parliament to give its opinion, vote on amendments and, as the rapporteur was saying earlier, ensure that our President has a proper democratic mandate.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, Mr Juncker, I obviously agree with what was said by Mr Daul, Mr Langen and Mr Mauro, so I will not go back over the same ground. I want to talk to you about something else, about what citizens understand. Last night, I was with a hundred or so citizens who were asking me about the crisis, as, unfortunately, it is one of the issues that I am dealing with. What we need to do now for Europe is win the citizens over and, above all, get them on side. You have two categories of citizens: those who give in to the lure of populism and who scream and shout ‘Europe is a failure; Europe is good for nothing’; and then you have all the other citizens, larger in number, who say ‘We expect a lot from Europe, but Europe is not convincing us in what it is doing’. It is therefore our job to convince these citizens together. What is more, I say convince the citizens before convincing the markets. I have heard endless talk about the markets; I know the markets and I know them professionally. Has nobody ever told you that the markets will never be satisfied? They will always ask for more. There is a change of government in Italy, and now they are saying that it needs guarantees that it will do this or that. When it has done this or that, they will ask it to do something else. The politicians need to regain control. The markets are useful. The economy needs them. They allow it to work. However, they should not take advantage. When I see the Commission back down, yesterday, on the credit rating agency project, on innovative proposals which, in my opinion, did not go far enough, this is no way to convince the markets. This is proof that we are all weak, that we give in to those who put pressure on us, forgetting that we are here to serve the citizens. You can count on this Parliament. I have just heard that Mr Schulz endorsed the ‘Six Pack’, which he did not vote for. That just proves that here, once you have voted, you are able to follow the Commission, to help it. Mr Barroso, you have just said ‘Help us!’ Does Parliament not help the Commission to move Europe forward? Then let us all be courageous and brave together. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, I note from the Commissioner’s speech that the Semester has been a success. I can only be pleased about that. With Europe in the throes of a major crisis, this tool, as it is called, needs to help move the situation forward. I should like to address, in particular, the Council representative. It took you 16 minutes to explain the mechanism, which we were familiar with, and to tell us that all this is very technical, that it is ultimately too much for one to understand and that, if Parliament wants to be informed, then it is in luck, because it can consult the documents that are updated for the general public online. You might also tell us to read the newspapers, which we do as a matter of course. I find it quite shocking that the only response to the question that was asked about Parliament’s role in the European Semester was that we should read the newspapers and search the Internet and we will learn just as much about it. You know, when we meet our fellow citizens – and I wonder whether you ever have cause to meet them yourself – they ask us: ‘What is Europe doing with regard to these issues?’ Until now, we would tell them: ‘Ah, we have developed the European Semester!’ Well today, the European Semester is a damp squib. That is what I wished to say to you, Mr Dominik. The method that has been applied excessively for some months now is certainly not one that will enable Europe to overcome the crisis. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, what we need to do is to restore confidence: to restore the confidence of the public, to restore the confidence of economic operators, and to restore the confidence of the markets. We will not convince the markets by endlessly proposing to increase the funds mobilised for bailouts. On the contrary, we will weaken our position. We will not convince the markets by announcing, day in day out, measures that are not enforced. We will not convince the markets by showing that the banks need to be recapitalised but not indicating how or why. We will not convince the markets with rules that, once decreed, are not applied. This is the case where rating agencies are concerned, Commissioner. The three main rating agencies are still not accredited, are still not supervised, and continue to put an excessive strain on the financial markets. It is therefore time to do something to convince the markets, Commissioner. The European institutions need to solve the real crisis, that of policy making. It is up to the President of the Commission and you to adhere strictly to the principles that you have defined and with regard to which you have the support of Parliament.  (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, a few days ago, I told you, in a friendly way, a number of things. You have not missed today’s opportunity. We heard – at last, I would say – these strong words that are necessary if we want to address the political decision crisis that we are in, for beyond the economic, financial and social crisis that you described, and the confidence crisis, there was and is a political decision crisis. By asserting today loud and clear the Commission’s role and its constructive proposals – of which some have already been implemented, on financial regulation in particular – and thanks to this Parliament, thanks to what will be voted for later on I hope, and thanks to the joint work that we will once again undertake – like Mr Schulz said earlier on – I think that we can make Europe move forward in the right direction and give you all the support you need, and that, henceforth, you fully deserve. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).  
– (FR)
 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Minister, the current uncertainty over the EU’s response to the crisis is particularly harmful, firstly for the countries concerned, but also for the markets, on which the pressure is becoming unbearable and dangerous. I would like to raise a purely technical issue in relation to this point. Since we recognise that a Member State may default, it is now crucial to define rules to govern this situation. When a business becomes insolvent, there are exceptional rules to protect it. However, there are no such rules for Member States, because it has long been accepted that Member States cannot default. Yet, the example of Greece clearly shows that constant pressure on a Member State prevents planned measures from being implemented effectively. It follows that the European Union must decide, within the framework of the euro area, which rules shall prevail. Membership of the euro area creates an original and ambiguous situation for every Member State: it is no longer the one issuing its currency, but its financial policy is still out of sync with that of the other countries. Clearly, the first imperative is the rapid completion of the economic policy coordination arrangements and of the European Stability Mechanism, but we also need to establish the rules that will apply in this area. In the case of countries under arrangements with the European Union or the International Monetary Fund, this would involve introducing provisions to freeze clauses concerning early repayment, forfeit of terms or credit events, which are today standing in the way of a genuine recovery. Introducing such provisions would ensure both transparency and credibility. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to use an image much loved by the Commissioner, this is a new brick in the regulatory and supervisory system that he is courageously and effectively putting in place. A new brick, and soon there will be another one, with short selling. To ensure that those bricks are firmly in place, however, we need the Council’s agreement, and that is why I believe we should make the most of the coming days in order to try to make a success of a trialogue that will enable us to reach a decision at first reading. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is in favour of postponing the vote on the legislative resolution until the next part-session. Doing so will give the negotiators time to reach a proper agreement. As Mr Langen, who has done a remarkable job in this difficult affair, said, this agreement specifically deals with the role of, and supervision by, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). ESMA is a key element in this financial regulatory system that has been established. The conditions must be in place, at European level, for that authority to carry out all aspects of its role, which is very important in this case. On the issue of scope, we support the rapporteur’s proposal to limit it to over-the-counter derivatives and their markets; it is also important to consider the issues of interoperability and of third countries. I would also point out that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in an effort to be practical, believes that there is no point in imposing the provisions retrospectively, except, perhaps, in the case of transactions that are carried out over a long period of time. This system is difficult and complicated, but it is vital if we are to prevent a repeat of the financial crises we have gone through. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I have a comment and a request to make. My comment is to emphasise that, thanks to Mr Stolojan’s work, we have been able to reach an agreement at first reading; I hope that this dossier will encourage the Council to successfully conclude the negotiations on the three other dossiers. Then I would like to ask you, Mr President, to give the floor to Mr Bodu. He mixed up the texts before and was supposed to take the floor on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs. I am making this request as coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, having listened to this debate as a layman, I think that we need to show some common sense in this affair. When crises occur, the citizens are the ones who directly or indirectly pay the consequences. I believe that when they realise the absurdity of selling something that one does not own, or of insuring against a risk for which one is not liable, they understand that this is an inappropriate system. I believe that we should try today to apply some common sense to this complex financial legislation, so that the human spirit is back at the heart of this work, instead of computer programs that are all configured in the same way to ensure that, when ridiculous transactions take place, no one really understands what is going on. I believe that Parliament has adopted some reasonable positions, and I hope that the Council will support them. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of this text is clearly to protect private investors from the fraudulent or deeply flawed practices of investment firms. This text is designed to increase confidence after a crisis in which retail investors, as you said, Commissioner, were definitely the most vulnerable stakeholders and the ones who suffered the most. It is important to understand that this text provides for the payment of compensation as a last resort. It is not paid out on an ad hoc basis, but as a last resort. That is why our committee unanimously adopted this report, which seeks to fully harmonise the rules and to increase the ceiling to EUR 100 000. In the specific case of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), the Commission’s feeling was not that measures to protect investors should be overlooked, but that this very specific product, which, incidentally, has an excellent reputation, deserved its own rules to be laid down as part of the revisions of the UCITS Directive. That is why the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has asked your Commission to undertake a study to discover what the advantages and disadvantages would be of extending the scope of this Directive on compensation for private investors to include UCITS. It is now up to the Council to agree so that the text that we adopted at first reading – since we will also be voting on the legislative resolution – can quickly be applied. I repeat: for Europeans and private investors, there is also a feeling of belonging to the European Union which must take the form of equivalent protection for all. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, many comments have already been made on the different reports that make up this governance package. What are the most important points, at this stage, to help us appraise the work that has been done? The fact that we have this package today, which is the result of negotiations between the Council and Parliament, already constitutes considerable progress. It fills an obvious gap in the development of the euro, and sadly it took the debt crisis to prompt us to do this. In this respect, we should stress the commendable work done by the Hungarian Presidency and the quality of the negotiators from this Parliament. I would also like to emphasise the results that Parliament obtained in the discussions with the Council, as the latter demonstrated genuine openness. We must remember how the situation used to be and measure the improvements objectively. Having said this, are these provisions satisfactory, and are they enough? There is always room for improvement, of course, but this package already provides real solutions to strengthen the euro area and to create the concerted economic approach that is needed. Can we seriously argue, as the opponents of this package do, that we can build growth on top of a mountain of debt that is continuously put off further and further into the future? To those who blame us for supporting a governance package that is not based on any theoretical or econometric model, I will simply say this: did the models you are talking about foresee or prevent the crisis we are going through and that has not ended yet; or did they lead, instead, to high-risk behaviours under the cover of mathematical truth? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow Parliament will have to make its decision, and I hope it will send out a signal loud and clear, both to our citizens, to restore their confidence in Europe, and to the markets, to stabilise our currency. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I rise on behalf of Mrs Lulling and Mr Langen, too; they had their own speaking time, but I assure you that I will not use it all up. I would just like to point out, as every one of you has done here, that the process of selecting a new Managing Director of the IMF has begun. It is important for the European Union to express a unanimous and strong position that is conveyed not only by the various Member States, but also by the Commission, and you have pledged to do that, Commissioner. Many of us in this House, with the exception of Mr Farage, are very keen to see the balance – a popular one until now – between the United States and Europe maintained during the process of appointing the Managing Director of the IMF and the President of the World Bank. We fully understand that emerging countries – particularly the largest ones – would like more of a say in the IMF’s decision making. It is important, therefore, to continue the reforms under way regarding the governance of that international institution, and particularly the ones that you also mentioned, Commissioner. However, it is definitely too soon for any radical changes to the balance achieved as a result of the Member States’ respective financial contributions to the Fund. Only one European candidate has launched a proper campaign by making contact with the various Member States. That candidate – who, by the way, is a woman – has the qualities required. Her skills, political experience, moral authority and perfect command of English, coupled with her experience of working across the globe, make her the ideal candidate for the post of Managing Director of the IMF. As has been said, the Managing Director must be someone who seeks consensus and is effective at a time when the institution has a vital role to play in helping to redress the economic and financial balance with a great sense of purpose. Our Union must therefore do whatever it takes to secure Christine Lagarde’s appointment. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, as you acknowledged just now, last year’s tests have not had the anticipated effects. We ought to avoid the same errors of conception and implementation. The fields of investigation must be consistent and similar. There will be no stabilisation if the diagnosis is not correct. Governments must be aware of that. This being so, the tests must quite clearly be realistic. The solutions that you have just given us, in a particularly detailed fashion, are of a kind that can provide an answer to our questions. It is now the job of the European Banking Authority, in supervising and examining the conclusions of these tests, to give a first test of its effectiveness. The tests must allow us to better define the potential recapitalisation needs of the banks and to take the measures that you have just mentioned. However, performing credible stress tests is the best way to calm the financial markets and to limit the influence of credit rating agencies and the negative effects of their decisions on the whole of our economy. The credibility of the results of these tests can end the dependency on these agencies, or at least can reduce it. The supervisory authorities have no choice but to ensure that the tests are successful; that is, that they provide convincing evidence. Let me use my allotted time, Commissioner, to draw your attention to the fact – in my opinion, a serious one – that the legislation relating to credit rating agencies, which has now entered into force, has not been applied, and that the authorities to which these agencies submitted their files did not take steps to inform them of the requirements of the agreement. We planned a transitional period pending the establishment of the European Securities and Markets Authority, yet today we are continuing to act as if nothing had happened. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, after the remarks that I have just heard, which are unworthy of this House, I should like to tell you that the majority of us believe that the EIB’s action is very positive. The improvements made by the Treaty of Lisbon provide new scope for action, which should help the EIB to become even more effective and to provide relevant solutions to the global financial crisis. As you emphasised, the EIB provides real support to small and medium-sized enterprises and makes a crucial contribution to the EU’s cohesion policy convergence objective. Those actions must be pursued and, if possible, increased. The EIB must do more to promote strategic investments in Europe, and so I should like to invite you to support those who have taken initiatives to improve long-term financing and, in particular, deposit and consignment offices − the caisse des dépôts
 and cassa dei depositi
 − and KfW. I believe that they should be supported, because the banking regulations and accounting regulations that are developed today do not encourage us to factor in long-term investment and penalise those who opt for it. Moreover, contrary to what is often said, we need changes and not just adaptations. Long-term financing is, as you also said, essential in order to open up a new horizon for Europe. Outside the European Union, you are right to say that the EIB must act as a driving force and hence must propose initiatives, in particular, for the financing of the Mediterranean countries. In the current turbulent conditions affecting a good many of those countries, the EIB can make a useful contribution to economic development within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean through its targeted financing, and can thus help to establish democratic civilisation in those countries whose future is still uncertain. I have noted your willingness to make that contribution if the Union asks you to do so, which I hope it will. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. 
– (FR)
 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I agree, of course, with what Mr Brok said. I should just like to draw attention to two points: the important thing today is to have legal certainty. In other words, there should be no ongoing debate regarding the legal bases of action that may be taken at European level, whether it be intergovernmental or Community action; our preference, of course, is for Community action. Why do we need this legal certainty? Because Europe and the euro area are under constant pressure from the markets. We cannot destroy the markets but we can try to bring them under control. To do so, we must eliminate uncertainty, the decisions that are put off each day, and we must stop constantly wondering whether or not we can take decisions. It is therefore a matter of urgency, Commissioner, for you to heed Parliament’s requests and for us to quickly amend the Treaty so as to guarantee this legal certainty, which is necessary in order to respond effectively to the difficult economic circumstances we are facing. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, I regret that there is some confusion in this report by Mrs Podimata, which raises a number of important issues with regard to innovative financing. I would like to ask the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament to withdraw the alternative motion it has tabled so that the joint drafting work that has been carried out can be concluded. Secondly, I regret that a slightly artificial opposition has emerged on the issue of a tax on financial transactions and that there are two very similar amendments. I regret that, as a result, Parliament cannot express its overwhelming support for this tax in conditions that are reasonable with regard to Europe’s competitiveness. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).  
– (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot but endorse what has just been said by Mrs Goulard on the basic presuppositions that mean that while we are well aware of the need for effectiveness and speed in the decision-making process, it is essential for Parliament to be involved. This is the only way in which our fellow citizens, of whom we are the elected representatives, can understand what is happening and explain it to them. I would like to raise one very specific point. We are buffeted, on a daily basis, by the financial markets, these financial markets, which stand for everything and for nothing, are most often inhabited by young people who have moved from Game Boy
 to computer without thinking too much about it, and yet who strike fear into the hearts of our countries. The way to bring the markets under control is not to eliminate them. I do not belong to a group that seeks to abolish the markets. However, what do the markets seek? They seek to avoid risk and the rule of the game in the markets is to pass risk on to someone else. This means that an operator will never feel happy as long as there is risk. I feel that if we are to have an impact on these financial markets, Europe must be able to draw some very clear lines, not change direction every other day, and not bubble with hosts of ideas which are never, subsequently, put into practice. If we want to bring this financial aspect under control, and this is vital for the economic stability of our countries, we need to be able – and it is your role, Mr Barroso, to provide this impetus – to set clear goals, clear measures and to show a clear determination in regard to good economic coordination. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to make two comments in relation to form: the rapporteur has just acknowledged all those who contributed to this report. This work was indeed a real team effort, in which our group member, Mrs Hübner, was particularly involved as shadow rapporteur. However, I have learned that the socialist group has submitted an alternative resolution, which means that a document on which there has been no consultation shall be put to the vote first. My second political comment – I do not usually make such comments – is that we are creating an artificial opposition here, especially with regard to the tax on financial transactions. The position of our group is clear: we are in favour of such a tax at global level; we are in agreement with it being trialled in Europe if it cannot be trialled globally. We simply feel that we cannot rush into this kind of decision without carrying out a thorough impact assessment in order to verify that the competitiveness of Europe’s financial centres will not be affected. In this regard, Commissioner, I would like to state clearly that the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is not to play for time, or to put matters on standby. We urgently and strongly request that the impact assessment which we have repeatedly discussed in this Parliament be duly and promptly carried out to allow us to make an informed decision on the matter. I think that, on the one hand, there is the hype which the opinion columns in some European newspapers serve to create, and, on the other, there is the real situation, where we have to manage this issue seriously by having a thorough knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages and making a political decision as quickly as possible. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

(FR)
 Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, I will address an issue that has been raised on several occasions and often presented as a single reason: speculation. I believe that, with regard to speculation, moderation is required. It is clear that there is a definite link between certain financial activities and increased volatility and prices for raw materials. However, looking at the entire issue solely in terms of financial speculation would certainly be a mistake, since part of what we call speculation is actually the legitimate hedging of prices on the part of producers and, as we are well aware, these producers could not do without this hedging possibility. However, a situation must be avoided in which direct investment in commodities has a harmful impact on price volatility because of its massive scale or its purely speculative nature. In this regard, the proposals made by Commissioner Barnier on financial matters, in particular the regulation of short selling and derivatives, and also the revision that is going to come from the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), must give Parliament the opportunity to take account of aspects of commodities speculation in financial regulation and supervision, which will be put in place to ensure that those markets are also regulated in an effective yet pragmatic manner. Commissioner, you said that these efforts should continue, and I believe that Parliament which, in a financial crisis, has complied with and, sometimes, anticipated what the Commission proposed, will live up to its responsibility. Finally, I welcome the declaration of the Hungarian Presidency indicating that Europe would support the French Presidency of the G20, which has made the regulation of the commodities markets one of its priorities.

 Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Barnier, this debate right now is not a legal debate; it is a true political debate. It is a debate on the future of financial regulation in Europe. It is the culmination of one aspect of the work conducted by Parliament, with the Council, under the guidance of the Commission. I am therefore going to be quite clear. For us, it is not about indulging in some sort of revolution or showing our biceps just for fun. It is about ensuring that the spirit that presided over the agreements between the Council and Parliament is, in fact, respected. It is not a lesson in law. The texts do not matter. We know the texts. What matters is the way in which these texts will be put into effect. In this regard, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the clarity of his speech. We have never sought to call the Commission into question, and the words spoken by the Commissioner are totally in accordance with the wishes of Parliament. We are talking here about a political act that consists in saying: ‘These institutions have been established, so we must give them the concrete resources to function properly.’ Yet, I think that we do not simply have doubts but also suspicions about the way in which these provisions have in fact been implemented by a number of Member States, by those that wish to unravel European supervision and prevent financial regulation at European level. That is what we are speaking out against, because we believe that, if that had been the case, we would have been cheated in the negotiations on supervision. The negotiations were long; they were difficult. Everyone made compromises. The Belgian Presidency did some remarkable work and the Commissioner provided extraordinary impetus. Today, we could be faced with institutions without effective power: due to the low status of the staff appointed; due to the fact that the Member States did not choose the best, and perhaps because the salaries were not attractive. In any event, today Parliament needs a concrete answer. Minister, I am bound to say that, despite the friendship that I feel for you, having sat on the same bench, in the same group and on the same committee as you, the letter, which I have seen and which, I admit, is only a first draft, is inadequate. I will give you the response of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is simple. You say, on behalf of the Council, that you fully endorse what the Commissioner has just said. I can tell you that, for us, this will be a satisfactory declaration. The statement made by the Commissioner is precise. It deals with problems of human and financial resources. Your letter needs to state: ‘We agree with virtually everything the Commissioner said’. Mrs Győri, this is very important. We agree with virtually everything the Commissioner said in plenary this evening. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I have listened to this long debate as a citizen. I would say that Mr Barroso’s proposals were very interesting. We would like to see them acted upon. A clear and comprehensible political will and a discourse of truth are the necessary conditions for restoring our citizens’ confidence. It is imperative that we do not mask realities. There is public spending, which we must cover or reduce. There are public and private debts, which we must repay. There are numerous experts who have ideas on everything. Those who did not see the crisis coming are now full of brilliant solutions. But in a difficult situation, let us use common sense. Let us not reproduce in the management of public finances the mistakes and errors of the private sector that led to the financial and banking crisis. Sophisticated arrangements do not create value and wealth. They create illusions and often benefit only the speculators. The fact of the matter is that the Member States have lived beyond their means. We must have the courage to draw the necessary conclusions and ensure that the burden of recovery is apportioned fairly. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, this is a purely technical amendment, to take into account the date that the regulation establishing the European Securities and Markets Authority will come into effect and the fact that this regulation can only come into effect at a later date. We should consequently adapt one recital and one article of the text on which we are going to vote. In recital 22, we should cut the second sentence and in article two, I also suggest that we cut the second sentence. This oral amendment has been the subject of an item of information and an agreement by the different groups that signed the compromise agreement. This text we will be voting on today completes the regulation of rating agencies and is part of the European Union’s policy to improve the regulation of financial services. I should like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Barnier and the Belgian Presidency for their very strong involvement in this issue. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, here we are in the third act of the financial legislation for 2010. Following supervision, following the directive on alternative investment fund managers, we are once again looking at credit rating agencies. I say ‘once again’ because Europe has not been slow in bringing in a regulation in this area which was conceived in 2009 and which is now taking effect. Credit rating agencies, in general, issue opinions, literally in the form of ratings, on the creditworthiness of businesses and states and on complex financial products. The rating reflects an assessment of the risk of issuers of financial instruments not being able to honour their debts. These agencies have gradually become very important in the financial world, for a variety of reasons. First, ratings are taken into account in banking regulations in order to determine the amounts of own funds that will be used to back investments. The second reason is that ratings have been a factor in the success of issues, since they have become a major indicator for investors. Yet, although credit rating agencies were not the main cause of the recent financial crisis, they did have a harmful influence. Indeed, they underestimated the probability that issuers of certain complex financial instruments would default. Faced with the need to restore confidence in the markets and to strengthen protection for investors, in 2009, the European Commission proposed a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies. Thus, in the same year, Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies was adopted. During the debates in the European Parliament preceding the adoption of this regulation, your rapporteur stressed the need for EU-wide joint oversight of credit rating agencies’ products and integrated supervision of them. At the time, European supervision of this type was legally impossible. However, the Commission undertook to draft a legislative proposal along these lines, and you, Commissioner, kept this promise. The agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament on the architecture of European supervision, which will enter into force on 1 January 2011, now makes the effective implementation of rating agency supervision possible. It is stressed in the Regulation establishing the European Securities and Markets Authority that this authority will exercise its own supervisory powers in relation, in particular, to credit rating agencies. That was the objective of the additional amending regulation on which we reached an agreement and on which we will vote tomorrow. What I wanted – and my colleagues supported this request – was for the other issues relating to credit rating agencies, allocation of sovereign debt, remuneration schemes and competition, to be postponed and dealt with in a study taking the form of an own-initiative report, which will precede the legislative proposal that you are due to make in the first half of 2011 and for which you have launched a consultation. I believe that, by establishing European supervision of credit agencies, we are taking a big step along the same lines as the supervision arrangements that have been implemented. I now want to thank the Belgian Presidency for its tireless efforts on the financial dossiers, you and your teams, Commissioner, and, obviously, my fellow Members in the European Parliament who participated in this study and who supported our positions. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, after the comments that you have heard, you can draw two conclusions. The first is that Parliament will overwhelmingly support this report tomorrow, which will show once again that Parliament, or a large majority of it, appreciates the actions on regulation and supervision that are being taken by the Commission and which have been strongly supported by the Belgian Presidency. The second conclusion that we can draw is that I will not come to a conclusion today, but that a new debate will open up, on the basis of this consultation, of Mr Klinz’s own-initiative report, to examine all these difficult questions. Thus, we cannot avoid the fact that in 2009, when we brought about the first regulation, we were already asking ourselves these questions. If we have not dealt with these questions, it is because we have not found an appropriate response. I hope, therefore, that, thanks to the thought that is being given to the matter with the submission of Mr Klinz’s report, the discussion about consultation which is taking place will this time enable us to provide responses to complete the regulation on rating agencies. In conclusion, however, if you will allow me, I will repeat a phrase by the President of the Securities and Markets Authority, who said that, at the very least, it would be good if the financial markets detoxified themselves of the rating agencies to allow investors to gain a greater personal appreciation of situations and risks. I think that that would also be a guarantee. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I believe that I have one minute if what I have been told is correct. President-in-Office of the Belgian Presidency, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to say, Minister, how much I appreciated your lucid assessment of the latest G20 and how supportive I am of your proposals for the future. I think it really must be said that the results have been fairly poor, even though Basel III and the IMF reform were approved. We can only hope, like the President of the Commission, that the Seoul summit paves the way for the implementation of the French Presidency’s ambitious proposals, which are justified by immediate need and the ongoing difficult circumstances. The European Union will need to be consistent if it is to carry the weight it deserves. Concrete results are essential, and I agree with you, President of the Commission, when you say that our fellow citizens are expecting action and not mere words or statements. The globalisation of the economy and finance require us to make real progress in the international harmonisation of regulations. Markets react much quicker than politicians. Europe must not be naive and must ensure that there is reciprocity. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, as the coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to emphasise two points in your programme. Firstly, strengthening economic governance and initiating the European Semester. We were pleased to welcome the package on economic governance. Achieving this target is critical. In this respect, our group would like to see effective and binding measures that go further than what is being proposed. It is also necessary for Parliament to be truly involved in finalising the processes envisaged and in their implementation. Legal bases should be found to prevent the treaties from being substantially amended, which would only slow down the implementation of measures that must be taken. The second point concerns the continuation of the work on financial regulation. The projects are on the table, or will be soon. 2011 will be a decisive year. We appreciate Commissioner Barnier’s pro-activeness. In 2010, Parliament showed its determination in adopting the supervision package, the directive on alternative investment fund managers and, in all likelihood by the end of the year, the regulation that will set up the European supervision of credit rating agencies. We want to continue on the path of a pragmatic, intelligent and effective regulation. That is what we are expecting from the Commission today. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Trichet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, I join the chorus of praise for the ECB’s work, and I shall not repeat what my colleague, Mr Balz, said or what is said in the resolution. In the short time allotted to me, I would simply like to say that we must consider our fellow citizens. Why do I say that in this way today? Because, yesterday evening, on all the French television channels, a future presidential candidate made a spectacle of himself by tearing up a EUR 10 note that he had photocopied and enlarged, and showing that, by tearing up that note, he was tearing up the cause of all our ills. Of course, that is not true. All that is needed is for us to make an effort, together, to communicate. The work that has been carried out in terms of supervision, organisation and regulation, to which you have referred, Mr President, is excellent. You know you have Parliament’s support: you said so yourself. However, we have a real task on our hands with regard to those of our fellow citizens who do not understand the messages that are being conveyed. Every day, the headlines in the press are of increasingly grim solutions and unlikely situations, and I can tell you that, on Friday, when I was out in the field, as we say in politics, I saw nearly 100 to 150 people. They all asked me the same question: what is going to happen with the euro? The fear felt by our fellow citizens is out of sync with what is being done, and done well, by the European Central Bank. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote that you are going to cast concerns one of the key elements of Europe’s response to the financial crisis, namely, the regulation of alternative investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. This compromise document, this compromise text, has been long in the making. We have succeeded in reaching a broad agreement, and I should like to pay tribute here, before the ECOFIN President, to the Belgian Presidency, which has been directly and significantly involved in this matter, in particular, through the Minister’s active participation in key trialogues, and I should also like to thank Commissioner Barnier, whose work has been particularly useful. Lastly, I should also like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs, the Secretariat staff and the experts who assisted us. This work took more than 14 months, and there were 1 690 amendments. It was a lot of work, but I believe that today, we have come up with a text that, thanks to the Belgian Presidency, marks a significant step forward in the field of European financial regulation. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, the text we are debating this evening, and which will be put to the vote in Parliament tomorrow, is the result of a long period of work. On 30 April 2009, the European Commission published its proposal for a directive on alternative investment fund managers. It aims to establish a safe, harmonised framework at European Union level to monitor and supervise the risks presented by managers for their investors, their counterparties, other actors in the financial markets and financial stability, while making it possible for managers, subject to observing strict requirements, to provide services and market their funds throughout the internal market. Mr President, may I just pause a moment, I wanted to know whether, given the length of our work, I had no time limit, because I see that the clock has not started. It does not bother me but, for honesty’s sake, I wanted to draw it to your attention. Parliament received the text about 14 months ago. It has aroused obvious interest among Members of the European Parliament, as a record number of 1 690 amendments have been tabled. Professionals have been involved very extensively and the rapporteur has had nearly 200 discussions on this text, not counting the discussions with national authorities. Finalising the compromise text that is being debated today has been particularly hard work. Half a dozen informal trialogues took place under the Spanish Presidency during the first half of 2010 in order to facilitate the exchange of information on the progress of the work. No agreement was reached in the Council during this period. On 17 May 2010, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, by a large majority, voted in favour of the report, which was the result of collective deliberation by Members of the European Parliament. Parliament introduced proportionality, differing rules for different categories of funds, regulation to protect the private equity of target companies and jobs and a passport system for funds and alternative investment fund managers based outside of the European Union. There then followed a dozen trialogues. A working party was also set up between the three institutions specifically to deal with the technical aspects of the proposal in a number of meetings with the Belgian Presidency and the Commission. On 26 October 2010, the trialogue, which was to become conclusive, was held, with the active participation of the President of ECOFIN, Mr Reynders, and of Commissioner Barnier, and an agreement was reached on a compromise text which the rapporteur felt could be put to the vote in Parliament. I shall not go into the detail of this lengthy technical document but will highlight the essential points. The directive will make it obligatory for alternative investment fund managers located in the European Union to be authorised or registered, and to comply with operational and organisational requirements, codes of conduct and transparency rules, and will make them subject to the power of the competent authorities of the Member States and of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to supervise and to impose sanctions. It will give them access to the Union’s internal market by means of an intra-European passport to manage and market their products. Eventually, managers based outside of the European Union will be able to qualify for a passport provided they meet the same requirements as managers whose head office is in the European Union. The number of meetings and the intensity of exchanges and negotiations between the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, the Presidency at the time and the Commission have very significantly enriched the initial proposal in a number of areas. In this respect, I need to make it clear that the progress sought by Parliament was achieved gradually in the course of negotiations and not, of course, only in the last trialogue during which some adjustments were made, but at the political level, it was decisive. I would now like to emphasise the areas in which Parliament’s intervention has been decisive. First of all, on two highly political issues, with regard to relations with third countries, the existence and implementation of a passport – well, now I really do not understand because normally I have four minutes – for managers residing outside of the European Union have been approved. Specific conditions for the granting of a passport have been laid down. With regard to private equity, Parliament has succeeded in ensuring that the directive includes provisions to avoid potential asset stripping of the target company and also specific rules concerning reporting obligations in relation to target companies, their employees or their representatives. Given the erratic behaviour of the clock, I shall not go back over some of the provisions that were achieved in accordance with Parliament’s wishes. I shall simply say that Parliament would have liked to have gone further, but it was able to influence negotiations so as to give more recognition to the ESMA’s role. The solutions that were upheld nonetheless constitute significant progress towards improving monitoring at European level. Parliament has been careful to strengthen the powers of the Council and of Parliament in the process of adopting acts delegated by the Commission. A majority in Parliament would have liked very strict control over passive marketing, or even its prohibition. The inclusion in a recital of the principle whereby professional investors have to carry out due diligence when they invest in funds located outside of the European Union constitutes a significant first step. That, Mr President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, is what I wanted to say in opening the debate. In closing, I shall take this opportunity of two minutes to thank all those who have contributed to this success. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, earlier, I spoke about the technical details. Allow me to use my last two minutes to express some richly deserved thanks: thank you first of all to all the fellow Members who have spoken today. My especial thanks to those who have said that they will be supporting the text, but to those who will not be voting in favour, I do not believe that putting me in the same bracket as Mr Cameron is really an insult either. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the groups: Mr Goebbels, Mr Bullmann, Mr Canfin, Mr Klute, and Mrs Regner, the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. I wanted to name them all in recognition of the incredible support that they gave me during the first phase of this process. We were able to work together productively, each putting forward his or her own points of view, and I would like to thank them for that. I am delighted that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the European Conservatives and Reformists have joined us now that a compromise has been reached and hence, I am delighted that Mr Klinz and Mr Kamall have co-signed with me the amendment that replaces the initial report. Particular thanks go to Mr Barnier for his considerable involvement in this dossier: he knows how much I appreciate him. I know that he knows that Parliament is relying on him and will support him in putting in place these building blocks that are so dear both to him and to us. I know it is unusual, but I would also like to thank Ugo Bassi, with whom I have had a very fruitful working relationship during this time, and so the text is also the result of work done within the Commission. As for you, Minister, earlier I felt that you contributed something when, in your thanks, you asked whether we would continue to make progress. So let me begin by thanking you, because without you we would never have achieved anything on the Member States’ side. These are genuine thanks, not simply a polite gesture – I believe that your personal commitment has been key to the progress made in the Council and to the fact that we have reached an agreement. You have also succeeded in ensuring that all the main groups can identify with parts of the text and in obtaining the majority that we both wanted for this directive. My thanks also for the contributions from our fellow Members on the left, without whose support the directive would not have the credibility that I am confident it will have tomorrow after a very broad vote. As you pointed out, this was vital for supervision, and vital for this directive too. I am also very grateful to your teams, Minister; please pass on my thanks. Some of the debates were pretty lively, but although I now live in Normandy, I come from the south, and sometimes my southern temperament wins out over the more balanced Norman approach. I also wanted to say, Minister, President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council, that I really hope that we will complete our work on rating agencies before the end of the year. For our part, we have the committee vote on 22 November, the vote in Strasbourg in December, and then, if the Council is ready, we will be ready. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, in 1968, our fellow Member Mr Cohn-Bendit’s friends wrote, ‘words, not deeds’ on the walls of Paris. Today, citizens are asking for the opposite: deeds, not words. We are hearing a lot of words, but our fellow citizens are not seeing results. The European Union’s slowness to respond is not good enough given the imperatives we need to deal with. We need to move forward together, with a united European spirit. In this respect, I would like to say a word about the role of Parliament. Here too, there is still work to be done in terms of upholding the codecision principle. The President of the Commission thanked Parliament several times for its support, but Parliament is not here simply to play a secondary, support role, or to ratify decisions taken by the Council without having the chance to discuss them first. Parliament is on a par with the Council. It is time we recognised this, and the debate on economic governance will be a test in this respect. Finally, as regards the forthcoming G20 summit, the European Union must present a united front to ensure that this international body plays the role that is expected of it and does not merely indulge in endless talk. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, the Treaty of Lisbon unquestionably provides Europe with new social objectives. Sustainable development in Europe is based on the high competitiveness of the social market economy, which means full employment and social progress, the fight against social exclusion and discrimination, the promotion of justice and the eradication of poverty. The Treaty of Lisbon confirms the role of the social partners and promotes social dialogue between the trade unions and the representatives of employers’ organisations at European level. On these various points, the actual situation is certainly not the one described by some speakers here. Today, we can dramatise the situation; it is true that there are worrying situations, that the crisis is not yet over, and that it has consequences. However, Europe is taking measures in this area – which we must explain to our citizens – to create some order in the financial sector, in particular, and in this regard, it is one of the first to be making efforts to organise that sector, on the basis of our work. Allow me to make a few short remarks. On services of general interest in particular, I will say clearly that we should take specific national circumstances into account, because it is true that some of our fellow citizens are a little alarmed – I am thinking, for example, of the French – when they feel, wrongly, that Europe is endangering the public services which are a French tradition. Likewise, in relation to public contracts, we should take account of individual circumstances, and especially of those which allow for collaboration between several public authorities. Nevertheless, social policy is dependent on the health of the economy and on economic growth. That is the primary objective of a social market economy. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by briefly praising Mr Karas’ excellent work. I was one of the people who were in favour of an own-initiative report being produced before the Commission makes its proposals on the framework for transposing the Basel Agreement, and I am delighted that the work done by Mr Karas with the help of the various shadow rapporteurs has highlighted the main points for consideration. I will not repeat them here, Commissioner, and of course I welcome the points you make and your determination to ensure that this regulatory framework is effective and workable and above all that it creates no distortion of competition at international level. To move on to a different subject, I cannot help noticing that there is often a big difference between the statements that are made publicly and the commitment to these in practice. I also note that countries outside the European Union, and I am thinking of the United States in particular, have an irritating tendency to make value judgments about how we operate, whilst they themselves are not putting the systems into practice as they ought. As regards Basel, it is vital that European companies are dealt with on an equal footing and are not penalised more than US companies. In the United States, few banks are taking notice of these directives or of the Basel Committee and, at present, nothing is actually being put into practice. I would hate to see the provisions adopted in June to regulate US finance – the statements made about these exaggerate their real impact – being used as a legal basis for not applying the provisions which might be introduced by bodies outside the United States. Commissioner, I trust in what I know to be your total determination and vigilance to ensure that this does not lead to a distortion of competition for the French banks, the European banks, and for those who finance the economy in general. It is right that we should be steering the banks back towards their primary role of financing economic development, but we must make sure that they are not penalised disproportionately. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, I recall a few years ago asking the then Competition Commissioner whether she was aware of any evaluation being carried out on the effectiveness for consumers of fines set, and on this matter, the then Commissioner indicated at the beginning of our committee meeting that she had managed to claw back so many million euro in fines. And so the answer was that it had not been considered. It would appear that since then, you have carried out studies to find out what damages were actually incurred. However, I would like to draw your attention to two matters. The first being that prices are fixed on the basis of a group’s turnover. However, the company that may have violated competition rules, and I am not condoning it, may be a relatively small company within the group. That is what bothers me, especially when there are separate legal entities involved. Secondly, Commissioner, and it is you who said so and not your colleague, you often talk about the need for prevention, saying that prevention is better than repression and, in any case, more effective. So the question I ask is whether these huge fines, which always make the front page of the newspapers in which they are delivered, really have any role in terms of prevention. And I wonder whether it might not be more effective in terms of prevention to focus more on the number of checks rather than on the level of fines. As has recently been the case in France, sentences can clearly be passed for sums of money requiring 4 or 5 000 years to be paid off. I think that we should not become fixated on these figures. We need to look specifically at the repercussions for the company, at a time of uncertain economic circumstances. Skewing the rules of competition is not right. It is quite right that a penalty is applied but this penalty needs to be truly proportional, which is why we wanted to know whether or not the Commission would amend its rules. I think you said that this would not be the case, which is a shame. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr Van Rompuy, first of all, I would like to say how happy I am to see that, on the question of the Roma, the positions for resolving the problems of poverty faced by these populations are balanced, reasonable and forward-looking. I would like to say to you, Mr Van Rompuy, that I appreciated your way of presenting the achievements of these last eight months. You presented them with vigour and precision. We do not say enough about Europe’s work, and neither do we say enough about the part Parliament plays in it. You spoke just now of collaboration, in particular, as it relates to supervision. This is good, because Parliament wanted agencies with a true European competence, which this supervision was able to introduce, because, as you know, the position of the Ecofin Council in December 2009 was much more reticent on this question. We must continue, at a time when the G20 will have a European Presidency, via France. We must say more, and we must say it stronger, with one voice. We must also have specific proposals for the future. We are counting on you, Mr Van Rompuy. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, I would, of course, like to add to all the congratulations offered and I would like to underline the work done and the excellent collaboration within this Parliament and also to remind you that without the will of Parliament, this supervision would certainly not have had the European characteristics that it has today. As far as the future is concerned, Mr Reynders, before the end of this period and perhaps even before the end of this month, I would like us to be able to reach an agreement on one of the subjects that concerns us to which you have dedicated yourselves, and not in vain I can assure you. In the coming days, thanks to the great minds of the Belgian Presidency, we will find a satisfactory solution on hedge funds and private equity. To repeat one of the Commissioner’s analogies, I think that we must add bricks to this framework that has just been outlined that will ensure that financial regulation is intelligent and affects all products. It is not about regulation for regulation’s sake. It is about trying to ascertain the effectiveness of regulation that is intended to limit as far as possible the risks inherent in the financial system. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Mr Wright who regrettably is leaving us. We hope that after all the work he has done to help Parliament achieve results, we will see him again soon on the European way. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I should naturally like to add my congratulations on the good result obtained in the area of supervision. As Mrs Goulard reminded us, Parliament’s effort has not been in vain, and in December something new and unique happened: a statement was issued by the four coordinators of the main groups saying that Europe needed to play a greater role in this supervision. Thanks to your dynamism, Mr Reynders, a good solution has been found. The Commission has clearly worked hard, and I welcome the financial services programme announced to us by Commissioner Barnier. It is fortunate that this happened, that this agreement was reached, because the EU’s financial credibility, its financial credibility in the eyes of our fellow citizens who, since the crisis have been asking us, ‘What is the EU doing? What concrete results have you achieved?’ is ultimately at stake. We can tell them that we are thinking about and working on this issue, that we are holding trialogues and meetings, but what they want is results. The EU’s credibility in the eyes of our international partners, particularly the US, is also at stake. I have recently been in contact with representatives from the US finance sector and, ultimately, what bothers them about the EU is this impression of legal uncertainty: we change regulations; we introduce revision clauses and sunset clauses; we do not build anything solid. I think that legislation must be definitive, albeit subject to amendment. We must not, above all else, give the impression that we are going to amend the texts two or three years down the road. Madam President, Mr Reynders, I should like to plead on my behalf: a very important trialogue will take place this afternoon with Commissioner Barnier and my colleagues on the regulation of hedge funds. It is essential that we find a solution soon. I am very conscious of the commitment on the part of the Belgian Presidency and of your personal commitment. We must reach an agreement over the next few weeks, so that next time you report on ECOFIN’s work, you will be able to say, ‘An agreement has been reached on the regulation of hedge funds.’ We are counting on this, and I know that you also are counting on it. We must now take the final step so that the right solution can be found. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
author.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, credit rating agencies were a matter of concern to this Parliament at the end of its previous term, and I should like to highlight in this regard the responsiveness of both the Commission and Parliament, which has adopted a regulation on credit rating agencies. Today, we are raising this issue once again because of the observations that it has been possible to make about the role of credit rating agencies during the crisis. They can be criticised for not having seen the crisis coming, they can be criticised for the volatility of their ratings and for their untimely decisions in announcing their ratings, especially when they relate to sovereign debt. Nevertheless, I believe that we must examine this issue with a clear head. Firstly, the fact that credit rating agencies rate products that they have submitted to investors is not, in itself, shocking. Investors who invest, who provide funds, are entitled to try to discover the risks or the difficulties that may arise, just as they are entitled to try to discover which ratings are good. Where the situation becomes slightly more ambiguous is when these ratings are used, in banking regulations, to determine the amounts of own funds that banks must have in exchange for some of their investments. From this point of view, the 2009 regulation does not really provide a solution since the idea was to provide for both the approval and the supervision of credit rating agencies. Therefore, a rating may be legitimate, but is it legitimate to issue ratings as the agencies do? I believe that the texts that you will propose – I would emphasise, Commissioner, that you have just submitted the text on the introduction of European supervision of credit rating agencies within the framework of the new financial regulation – must enable a solution to be found to these issues, especially that of competition in the field of credit rating agencies. From my perspective, I do not think that simply confirming the creation of a European agency, even if it is public, solves the problems. If the idea is to have an agency that issues ratings in a kinder, more generous fashion than the others, it will not be of much use. More questions need to be asked, in my opinion, about the conditions in which the agencies issue their ratings. There are ratings of private enterprises, and there are ratings of sovereign debt. I shall emphasise the ratings of sovereign debt. The authority which, at Parliament’s request, will be responsible for monitoring and supervising those agencies that will operate in Europe is ESMA, the new financial services authority. I also think that the powers conferred on ESMA should include the possibility not only to supervise the agencies effectively, but also, as regards sovereign debt, to provide for a facility by which to monitor, though not censure, the way in which credit rating agencies issue sovereign debt ratings. We cannot allow a situation – and such situations have indeed arisen – in which, 15 minutes before the markets close, an agency downgrades a country, thus giving rise to completely undesirable consequences. In fact, what needs to be done is to implement a preventive system that will force credit rating agencies to inform the supervisor, within a very short timescale, if need be, of the conditions in which they envisage issuing ratings so that the supervisor can verify both that the standard procedures have been followed and, above all, that the conditions in which the ratings are issued will not adversely affect the situation as regards, in particular, sovereign debt. The debt of businesses is not the same as that of states; it deserves to be treated differently. That being said, some people have mentioned the Court of Auditors, but such courts do not exist in every European country, and they are not all independent. That, Mr President, Commissioner, is the thrust of our questions. How can we improve the operating methods of credit rating agencies and, above all, the dissemination of information, and how can we improve competition? Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial situation in Europe fully justifies the drastic measures which have been taken, in particular, to stabilise the euro area and to avoid the undermining of our single currency. The urgency of the situation justifies the practical approach adopted. However, when it comes to implementing the adopted measures, it should be ensured that Parliament is involved, within the scope of its powers, and can exert its democratic control in appropriate conditions. Indeed, we must ensure that our fellow citizens do not lose confidence, and can regain confidence, in the political institutions. Without such confidence, no structural reform or acceptance of the necessary austerity measures will be possible. Faced with the financial crisis, Europe has not been inactive. We do not say this often enough. In 2009, we drew up and adopted regulations on the credit rating agencies, the implementing provisions of which will be published very shortly by the Commission. Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted a few days ago for the package on the supervision of financial activities. Last Monday, the same committee adopted the report on regulation of hedge fund managers by a large majority. Trialogues have been initiated to seek an agreement with the Council. This agreement must be obtained rapidly, so that our institutions retain their credibility. Our fellow citizens often ask us: ‘What is Europe doing?’ We must meet their expectations. In this regard, I should like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on your determination, and to encourage you to continue with the work programme which you have set out, in accordance with the undertakings made at your hearing. Your ambitious but essential timetable has our support. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with you so that the necessary regulation of financial services takes place. This is not a question of bullying the finance sector, but of establishing the rules to ensure that an activity which should be regulated is regulated, and of making transactions more secure and transparent. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis we are experiencing has forced public authorities to intervene financially using public money. Under these circumstances, it is tempting to consider the implementation of a tax on financial transactions. The income from this tax would be used, for example, to finance the recovery and to develop a sustainable economy, and could initially serve to offset the cost of the crisis borne by the real economy and the taxpayer. This tax would be added to the regulations governing the financial sector, the elimination of tax havens or even the regulations currently being drawn up for derivative products. At this stage, it would be advisable to evaluate the effects of a tax on financial transactions. That is the main purpose of this oral question: to encourage the Commission to examine in practical terms the various points listed in the draft resolution in order to give an opinion on the feasibility and timeliness of such a tax. Commissioner, what you have just said is a step in the right direction. It should, however, be stressed – as you have done – that this measure will have to be approached in a realistic and pragmatic way. Such a tax must not be harmful to the European economy or to the competitiveness of the European financial industry. More generally, it is important to underline the consequences of implementing this tax in the European Union alone, as some people are advocating, if no agreement were possible at international level. We believe that this sort of purely European solution cannot be countenanced. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I do not doubt your determination, and you have, in the points that you have just covered, already answered most of the questions we were going to ask and that are raised by this resolution. I will simply remind you that the difficulty of the subject stems from the fact that the single euro payments area (SEPA) is an initiative of payment institutions, particularly banks. Also, may I say that the purpose of the directive on payment services, for which I had the honour of being rapporteur, was specifically designed to enable us to identify and define the legal instruments needed in order to put this European payments system in place. Another purpose of the directive was to improve competition in the area of payments, and Title II made provision for the creation of payment institutions, which were intended to break the monopoly of the banks. This complicated beginning certainly explains part of the delay, but it is certainly also true, as you have said, that payment services establishments – that is, banks – have demonstrated a certain reluctance to implement this mechanism. There is an explanation: the cost. I am sure you already know this, but to give you an idea: in France, for example, the cost of implementing SEPA is higher than that of changing to the euro. There has also been the matter of interchange fees, which deserves to be tackled. There are two issues involved. The first, as you mentioned, is that of conformity to the rules of competition, but the second issue, which must not be neglected, is that the payment service is a commercial activity for payment institutions which must, therefore, be fairly remunerated. What has been condemned is the possibility of setting interbank margins unilaterally, arbitrarily and without consultation, when these rightly appear excessive. Commissioner, we are counting on you to ensure that the progress we have made with the creation of a single-payments market can result in the swift implementation of European tools for transfers and direct debits. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with many of the arguments put forward by Mrs Thyssen, Mr Karas and Mrs Castex. Nevertheless, I ask myself the following question: following the compromise that we have managed to reach, allowing national options to survive, must we block this directive which constitutes a positive sign of simplification for micro-entities? If I may, Commissioner, I would like to make a non-committal proposal. First of all, I would suggest that Parliament must support Mr Lehne’s proposal and that you take into account what has just been said about modifying other directives. In that way, we will very quickly reach agreement: accounting rules for small businesses, and a European system in that area. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Madam President, President, Commissioner, like Mrs Wortmann-Kool before me, I am, of course, going to tell you that we approve of the positions adopted by the Commission to deal with the current situation in Greece. As regards the Spanish Presidency, we are pleased to note the objective that you are setting yourself to improve the coordination of economic policies. This strong political will must also be applied in order to see through two current and important projects: the structuring of a genuine form of financial supervision and the regulation of hedge funds. True, Europe must not be a fortress, but nor must it be a sieve. In both these areas, the Presidency really must have room to manoeuvre so that it can negotiate productively with Parliament. We expect the Council, at its next meeting, to send out a strong signal to the public and to the market: to the public to restore confidence in the euro, and to the market to show its solidarity with Greece. The Council must give a strong indication that it will not let itself be overawed by the attempts to destabilise the euro made by certain speculators who have no hesitation in speculating against those Member States that are currently facing economic and social difficulties. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the commissioner’s comments just now genuinely answer the question that was asked. The European Union does not make funds available without conditions. Those conditions have been mentioned: quality of public spending, sustainable development objectives, employment policy, climate change, but also, of course, the need to make up for the shortfalls of the previous administration as quickly as possible, so that these countries that we are helping can reach the level required. However, in a crisis such as the one we are going through, I believe that we must not go overboard with conditions. We must trust the governments of the Member States that receive European aid to implement the necessary provisions and avoid, as the commissioner said, provisions that could be retrograde or backward-looking. Social spending is, of course, important – it must be preserved – but here, too, we must trust the Member States to adopt the measures needed to rectify the situation and not carry out nit-picking checks, which would be ineffective anyway. The time to assess the way in which the Member States have used European aid will be when any new aid is granted, and it is then that we will perhaps be able to draw conclusions from measures that were unsuitable, particularly in the social sphere. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome your determination. Europe has begun to put in place effective regulation, but Europe must not find itself isolated. Close international cooperation is necessary, and this is exactly what we expect of the G20. It must pursue the reforms, which were initiated at previous meetings, with rigour and vigour. The international framework for regulating the financial sector must be completed, so that it can aid investment, growth and employment. Guiding principles must be affirmed. The crisis is not over. We must not return to the situation ex ante and abandon measures needed to avoid, as far as possible, the renewal of crises which are particularly damaging to the real economy, growth and employment. The strengthening of supervision and regulation is equally necessary. The obligations for supervision should reflect the level of systematic risk that the financial institutions impose on this sector. Speculative activities, which represent a significant risk, should be discouraged by increasing the capital requirements and applying the Basel rules internationally. As for salaries in the financial sector, we should recommend pay committees, increase transparency of these salaries with stricter disclosure requirements and supervise variable salaries, notably bonuses. The strengthening of global financial institutions is likewise an imperative, as is the reform of governance and representation at the IMF. Commissioner, these are some of the expectations citizens have of the next G20, where Europe must speak with one voice, with determination and conviction. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

) Madam President, President of the Court of Auditors, I would like to start by thanking you and all of the members of the Court – including Ms Kaljulaid, who is here with you – for the work you do and in particular for the attention you pay to Members of the European Parliament. You pay us a great deal of attention and I really wanted to thank you for that. I would also like to thank Commissioner Šemeta, who, following on from the remarkable work of his predecessor, continues to improve the auditing of our accounts and the quality of special reports. I would like to apologise on behalf of my colleague, Bogusław Sonik, who has been detained by other parliamentary commitments. I too regret the absence of the Council, which is the budgetary authority. Mr President, this report comes too late. That is not your fault. I tabled amendments to the Financial Regulation to change the timetable. The European Commission must present the accounts before 31 March each year, the Court must publish its report before 30 June, and Parliament must vote before 31 December. It is inconceivable that today, in November, we should still be talking about matters concerning 2011. I suggest that the working group that I have proposed should meet to change this timetable. I would like to make a few observations: Article 323 of the Treaty suggests that Parliament should ensure that the necessary financial means are made available to the European Union. I wonder if the Court could not play a role in raising the alarm about the Union’s cash position: we have learned that we had a shortfall of EUR 9 billion and we are incapable of paying our bills. I would therefore suggest that the Court can help us to monitor the functioning of the Union. A final word about shared management: I think that we need to take another look at it here. I wonder about the independence of the audit authorities and about relations with our national audit institutions, and I think that the shared management system – which has proved useful in its time – should be re-examined. I wonder if we should not create our own finance function at Union level and get rid of this system of shared management, which contains a lot of errors, is very expensive and the efficiency of which merits re-examination. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Firstly, I regret that the President of the European Council did not attend the debate. The crisis has caught up with the debate on the European budget. We argue: that is normal. However, we need an agreement; otherwise, we will be the laughing stock of the international community. Yes, we must support the European Commission’s excellent proposals. At the same, however, we cannot ignore the financial difficulties that many Member States are experiencing. In this context, I have a suggestion to make: we should maintain the overall multiannual ceiling proposed by the Commission and establish two separate periods. The first would last three years and we would agree to freeze appropriations to give the Member States time to put their finances in order and ratify the Treaty on Stability. During the second period, from 2017 to 2020, we would increase the budget slightly to reach the amount proposed by the Commission, and this would be financed, in particular, by the own resources established in the meantime. In 2014 we will have a new European Parliament, a new Commission and a new President of the European Council. In 2015 the United Kingdom might leave the Union. We could have a political debate on all of these matters when we come to the 2014 European elections. Jean-Pierre Audy,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control
. − (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, my first words will be to give apologies on behalf of Ms Ivanova, detained by other Parliamentary activities, who has entrusted me with summarising for you the report of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Our committee recognises that financial instruments are useful in creating multiplier effects and leverage effects, such as guarantees and tolls. However, we draw your attention to the recommendations of the Court of Auditors and its 2010 opinion on ownership of instruments, risk-taking, accounting, transparency and reinforcement of EU staff capacity to operate them. The second point concerns links with financial markets. We think that these instruments should only be used when there is no offer from the private sector, so as to avoid any distortion in financial markets. Lastly, speaking personally, I am sorry that the idea of introducing an obligatory user contribution was not explored, in particular for trans-European transport networks that need financing, particularly those are not immediately profitable.

Mr President, I want to say something about the interpretation of Rule 191 of the Rules of Procedure. As there has been no announcement, I gather that there has been no opposition to that interpretation. For the sake of democracy in our Parliament, I wanted to be sure that it had no retroactive effect, that it did not affect the current mandates and political agreements within the committees, and that this rule would apply to the renewal of future mandates in the parliamentary committees concerned. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we must reach an agreement if we do not want to be the laughing stock of the international community over what, unfortunately, remains a small budget. That agreement is difficult to reach, however. I would like to emphasise the need to establish a review clause for 2017. By 2017 the Member States will have had time to ratify the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance. The issue of public finances will be resolved, as will the issue of sovereign debt. In 2017 we will have a new Parliament, a new Commission and a new President of the European Council. Consequently, if we do not reach an agreement, let us open a political debate on all of the issues. In this regard, I would like to emphasise this review clause, which, in the context of this political debate, will allow us to set out perspectives that correspond to the European ambitions to which we all aspire. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I want to make a point of procedure to the members of the Conference of Presidents under your authority, Mr President. I regret that we did not have a political debate to prepare for this European Council with the General Affairs Council. I would suggest, and I hope you agree, President-in-Office of the Council, that you should come and prepare for the European Councils with us so that you can hear the political debates in this House. I was disappointed in this European Council: very little was said about growth; practically nothing on competitiveness; no proposals on a major infrastructure investment plan. Indeed, all we heard about it in the press was that agreement had been reached on the timetable for the banking union. When it comes to the proposals concerning the contractual relations between the Member States and the European Union, like some other speakers, I have a hard time believing them. Take the national reform programmes: France, under Mr Fillon’s Government, put forward proposals that were accepted at the June European Council, with the new President of the Republic. Where are the recommendations for each Member State? France had proposed reducing public spending, and reforming pensions and the labour market. I think that we need to monitor these country-specific recommendations. However, we can tighten contractual relations through convergence on social aspects; Article 155 of the Treaty provides for this. We must ensure convergence of minimum wages. The former communist countries have been members of the European Union for eight years. We must factor convergence of minimum wages into the price chain. As you said, President-in-Office of the Council, we need to restore confidence. We need to use politics to restore the confidence of the people. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, I should like to speak about those paragraphs which refer to Parliament’s organisation and its seat. Paragraph 86 [sic
: 87] states that Parliament believes that, like every directly elected parliament, the European Parliament should have the right to decide on its own seat. This statement is an error, Mr President, and I should like to request that, in accordance with the appropriate procedures, this error should be removed. Admittedly, the German Parliament, the Bundestag, decided, on its own account, to transfer its seat from Bonn to Berlin, but constitutional and political practices differ widely from one Member State to another. In the Member State to which I belong, the seats of the National Assembly and the Senate are determined by statute. Then there are the paragraphs which call for studies regarding the savings to be made. From the carbon-footprint point of view, a seat in Strasbourg is exactly the same as a seat in Brussels. As for savings, I believe that it is necessary to include a study of all EU seats: the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, the European Medicines Agency in London, the European Banking Authority in London, the European Patent Office in Munich, etc. If we are going to carry out a study, let us do it covering all the seats of the European Union rather than, as it were, deliberately singling out the European Parliament. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to express my regret at the absence of the Heads of State or Government. That is nothing against you, Minister for European Affairs, but there is no Head of State here, not even their representative, President Van Rompuy. Where is Baroness Ashton, attending the European Council meeting? Yes, we need a federation of nation States in the long term, Mr Barroso, and we support you on this matter. However, we must not forget a Europe of results. Above all else, we need a Europe of results. We need to keep an eye on our banks, our major infrastructure, on budget cuts, diplomacy and defence. I should like to draw your attention to social convergence. Look at the former communist countries. It is not eight days that they have been members of the European Union, but eight years. The minimum wage is EUR 200. We should be ashamed. We have the necessary legal bases – Articles 154 and 155 of the Treaty – and therefore wage increases should be achievable through social negotiation. Yes, we need to move towards a federation of nation states. However, we need less haste and more speed. If we were to hold 27 referendums, 25 or 26 of them would say ‘no’. Do not rush us; we will not move towards a political Europe without democracy. And we must consider the suffering of the people. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for all the competence, patience and vision that you have employed in performing your duties. I should like to make some observations on your proposals. Firstly, I am surprised that the Council is not here, because it is the Council which really should have presented this proposal to us. It is in charge of this matter and not the Commission. It is up to the Council to make this proposal for a specific mission of the Central Bank relating to prudential supervision. I agree with some of my fellow Members: this legal basis does indeed have the merit of being efficient, but I do not think it meets our fellow citizens’ expectations, as they wanted regulation at European level. Furthermore, I am puzzled about Article 15 of the proposal, which lays down sanctions, while the legal basis, namely Article 127(6), only provides for prudential supervision. We are told that managers will be removed or fines imposed of up to 10% of turnover. I believe that we should have this point checked. I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, for approximately the last four years, the Committee on Budgetary Control has, under this legal basis, been calling for regulatory supervision of the European Investment Bank, and it would be worthwhile for this regulation to extend to cover public banks, and particularly public development banks. Finally, I believe that, under Article 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, we could consider introducing a European policy on regulators, for, under this Article, the Union is entitled to adopt any measure it needs to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market – regulators for credit institutions, and also for insurance, which is not provided for under Article 127(6), and for energy and digital technology. In short, we must introduce a genuine regulatory policy for our European markets if we wish to achieve a genuine internal market. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Commissioner, finally, we have a European Council on growth. I am sorry that in December 2011, when the Heads of State or Government agreed on the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, the President of the European Council did not call a specific Council to look at growth, but we have got there in the end. I think that we need to call formally on the 25 states to ratify this Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which sends out a message of confidence and solidarity, in terms of both the markets and the people. I appeal to the political powers in France to honour the signature of the French Republic without delay. We have talked about growth, but I think that we also need to talk about competitiveness. We need to talk about the competitiveness of our continent: yes, we need a major infrastructure plan. We do not need EUR 10 or 20 billion; we need investments of between EUR 1 000 and 1 500 billion. We lack imagination when it comes to own resources. Why not establish compulsory contributions for digital measures, energy networks, roads, railways and water? I am proposing once again that we carry out an audit of public spending and pool military, diplomatic and research spending. Finally, on an institutional level, I was pleased that our Chair, Mr Daul, reiterated the suggestion that the President of the European Parliament be invited to the European Council. However, Mr President, the President of the European Council himself needs to establish a relationship with our Parliament. Since the establishment of a permanent presidency, we have had no contact with the Heads of State or Government. We need political dialogue at the very highest level with the Heads of State or Government and with Mr Van Rompuy, who is absent from this House far too often. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, as part of these discussions on Venezuela’s decision to withdraw from an inter-American human rights organisation, I would like to draw Parliament’s attention to the fact that very important trade negotiations are currently under way between two trade blocks, the European Union and Mercosur, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, and that Venezuela is a candidate for accession to Mercosur. That might appear a little irrelevant, but I believe that we, ourselves, cannot work with areas which do not respect a body of rules of law. We are clearly not going to interfere in the procedures for States to become members of Mercosur, in the same way that Mercosur has no right to intervene to decide whether Croatia joins the European Union or not. Nevertheless, in the negotiations between these two blocks, I feel that the European Union and South America should share in a common destiny. It would therefore be a very bad signal if Venezuela did not respect human rights, and that is an issue that this Inter-American Commission is meant to monitor. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

) Mr President, Minister, Commissioners, I will never get used to European Councils being prepared by the General Affairs Council, and I am disappointed that Mr Van Rompuy has not come to debrief us at this meeting, even if it is informal. Actually, Minister, the problem at hand does not come under the authority of the rotating Presidency. Since there has been a permanent Presidency, we at the European Parliament no longer have any contact with Heads of State or Government. We are facing a problem which falls to the European Council and Heads of State or Government. I regret that we have no dealings with Mr Van Rompuy because the truth is that the Council convened tomorrow and one at the end of June is intended to close the European Semester. This is not exactly the European Council on growth that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) asked for as far back as early December last year. A few thoughts on the matter: firstly, we are no longer listening to advocates of zero growth. This is good news. Next, I reiterate the idea that we should examine the effectiveness of public spending. I propose an independent audit, conducted by the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors, to find out where we could make savings: 27 armies, yet no enemies, research programmes that have been funded 15 times without any coordination, hundreds of diplomatic buildings where the costs are not even shared. The second point of thought is competitiveness. A word that is not used enough. Firstly, the competitiveness of our companies (flexicurity, labour costs) – and this does not mean public spending and higher levies as proposed by Mr Hollande to resolve the problems of competitiveness that we face in Europe and France. Next, the competitiveness of the continent. Yes, we need a major infrastructure plan for roads, digital technology, space and universities. Finally, for struggling States, I suggest, in line with Jean-Paul Gauzès’ proposals, that we consider establishing hive-off vehicles, beyond ratios, with a banking licence, in other words, access to the European Central Banks (ECB)’s cash to help States recover. However, each State needs to pay off its debts. We are never going to get a political majority whereby the people of one State pay off another State’s debts. Each State needs to pay off its own debts. Lastly, Mr President, the speech on the State of the Union is woefully inadequate. I propose organising a Congress of the Union in the autumn, which would bring together Heads of State or Government, the European Commission, the European Parliament and national parliaments to ensure that the direction of the continent is in the interests of the European people.

 Mr Hoang Ngoc, you are talking about taxes and collecting taxes. I am talking about public spending. The experts tell us that, in terms of public spending at each of the three levels, in other words, European, national and regional level, which includes local authorities, if we were to take a close look at our public spending, without touching upon the issue of sovereignty, if we were just to look at how we can make improvements to pool our expenditure, we could save billions and billions and billions, which could be used to reduce debts and to make investments. I am not talking about taxes; I am talking about making savings in public spending. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 On the basis of the report by Portuguese MEP Vital Moreira, I voted for the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the 2009 regulation on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. On 28 July 2011, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) adopted the Appellate Body Report in the case ‘European Communities – Definitive Anti-Dumping Measures on Certain Iron or Steel Fasteners from China’. In the reports, it was found, inter alia
, that Article 9.5 of the Council Regulation of November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community was inconsistent with WTO rules. This legislative proposal aims to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings.

I voted in favour of discharge to the Commission on the basis of the report by my excellent colleague, Christofer Fjellner, who has accomplished an immense task in difficult conditions. I do not understand why the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors do not work together enough. With regard to the consolidated accounts, it is not normal to present them with negative equity and not include the EU’s ownership over the Members States in terms of staff pensions, the debt for which is, moreover, provisioned as a liability.

 I did not vote for the proposal to postpone discharge to the Council proposed by the report of my Spanish colleague, Inés Ayala Sender. By mistake, I did not vote for discharge in the Committee on Budgetary Control. As last year, my intention was to do so. I note that the European Court of Auditors did not comment on the management of the Council. I am also disappointed that my proposal for a legal study of the power of the European Parliament to grant discharge to the Council was rejected. That would have identified, in particular, the consequences for discharge of the creation of the European Union as a legal entity by the Treaty of Lisbon. I think these debates between the Council, which thinks that, unlike the other EU institutions, it is not responsible for the use of the funds made available to it, and the statement that granting discharge to the Commission equates to granting discharge for the entire EU budget, including the parts of the budget used by the Council, are derisory. All these debates do not reflect well on the Committee on Budgetary Control. I hope things will quickly become clear. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, my first words will be to congratulate Ms Ticău on the tremendous work she has done in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on this eGovernment dossier. I would like to thank the Commission for its work. I should like to make three comments. First, we need assurance that we have the coverage that will enable us to use all these new technologies across the entire European continent. This is an important factor for the competitiveness of our continent. In the canton of Meymac, in Corrèze, of which I am the elected representative, and also in Limousin and Auvergne, not all of our territory is covered, and this is a real problem. We need to achieve 100% coverage within the European Union and the Member States. Secondly, government must not, under the guise of making life easier, become more complex. We, the citizens, are tired of excessive complexity and bureaucracy. Finally, I would like to make a comment concerning the siting of officials. These new technologies must enable officials to stay where they are and give them the possibility of teleworking with their central administration, thanks precisely to eGovernment.

 Considerable work has been carried out in the area of financial stability – congratulations! However, it is incomprehensible for Spain or Italy to borrow from the banks at 6% while the banks borrow from the European Central Bank at 1%. I propose that we create, within each Member State of the euro area, special purpose defeasance entities, with a banking license to manage bad debt that exceeds the ratios authorised by the Stability and Growth Pact. I propose a political debate between national parliaments and the European Parliament on savings to be made in public expenditure (e.g. armies, diplomatic buildings, research programmes) at three levels – national, European and regional – based on an independent audit which could be conducted by the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors. I reiterate the idea of a major investment plan of EUR 1 000 – 1 500 billion over the EU 2020 period and the creation of an investment section in the European budget.

Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday at 06.46, Strasbourg time, time stopped in Japan. In a joint prayer, the Japanese people turned their thoughts to those killed or injured by the natural disaster together with the serious nuclear incident at the Fukushima power plant. One year earlier, on 11 March at the same time, 06.46, an earthquake of 8.9 on the Richter scale caused the loss of the plant’s electricity supply. The reactors shut down and the emergency generators went into operation. Unfortunately, 55 minutes later, 14-metre high waves devastated the plant: 19 000 dead, 340 000 displaced persons, an earthquake and a tsunami produced the greatest nuclear disaster in the world. Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) I would like to thank you for your initiative and to say that the dignity and courage of the Japanese people, their government and the families affected are in our thoughts. We are thinking of them. This disaster led to a political debate, as you have pointed out, involving all sectors of the public. In the heat of the moment, some states decided either to shut down nuclear power plants immediately or to gradually phase them out. However, worldwide there are more nuclear plants being constructed than the number shut down, and so the issue is a topical one. Moreover, this disaster is just one in the list of increasingly frequent disasters worldwide. Who could forget the earthquake in Haiti or the Deepwater oil disaster? Commissioner, the European Union reacted immediately, and I would like to thank your colleague, Mr Oettinger. After the disaster on 11 March, the European Council met immediately, on 24 and 25 March 2011, and called for a comprehensive evaluation of the safety risks of nuclear power for all the plants in the European Union. The European Commission was asked to review the June 2009 directive on nuclear safety, and the programme was thus set up. Today, all the Member States have carried out their evaluations; we await a peer review and the European Council in June 2012 will make an overall assessment. The PPE Group would like thinking to focus on the following areas for improvement. Firstly, with regard to safety standards, the European Union and its citizens must be assured that we have the best safety standards in the world. We know that these safety standards develop in line with scientific expertise and that they must be continually amended and made binding upon operators in the sector. Secondly, governance must be reviewed so as to give greater independence to the national safety authorities. My third point relates to transparency. In this sector, transparency must be beyond reproach. All national safety authorities must make their documents public to ensure that their citizens are properly informed. Fourthly, we must review development and the technical criteria relating to the selection of sites where nuclear power plants are located. Fifthly, we must jointly improve emergency preparedness and response. I would like to remind Members of the proposal to create a European civil protection force. Sixthly, operators’ civil liability needs to be clarified. We must include all the costs of nuclear power within cost prices, including possible risks and the costs of decommissioning power plants, either through suitable insurance, or through own capital requirements. Seventhly, the full costs should be included – sorry, I just said that, in relation to risks and decommissioning. Eighthly, I would like to mention scientific training and research. On this point, I welcome the Commission’s proposals to extend the Euratom research programme by two years. Worldwide, we will not be able to resolve our problems concerning energy and competitiveness, maintaining our lifestyle while tackling global warming, without addressing all these issues, which are necessary for the operation of nuclear power plants throughout the world and, in particular, for maximum safety.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Šefčovič, I am having trouble getting used to the fact that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, it is the General Affairs Council that prepares the European Council meetings and it is you, Mr President, who wishes to participate in the European Council. I propose that President Van Rompuy be invited to prepare European Council meetings. I would like to discuss three ideas, primarily with regard to making savings, but specifically savings in the sense of avoiding public spending. I propose that we consider pooling the resources of the European Union and the Member States, starting, for example, with an audit by the European Court of Auditors, in partnership with our 27 national courts of auditors, on the savings we could make. Twenty-seven armies, more enemies, research programmes financed 15 times over without coordination and hundreds of diplomatic buildings for which we could guarantee management for 10 years. Finally, for growth, we should return to this idea of a major investment of EUR 1 000 to 1 500 billion in the Europe 2020 strategy. I also think we are not working enough on social convergence, with minimum wages that are not progressing. What hope do our people have if we fail to factor into the price chain a return to social convergence? Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, President of the Commission, let us start by talking about economic and financial subjects; you have stated, Prime Minister, that Denmark did not envisage being involved in the economic integration of the euro area. Could you reassure us of the swift implementation of legislative proposals on derivatives and the two regulations which must accompany the overhaul of the Stability and Growth Pact? We really do need these texts. Majorities – particularly a political majority – are forming on the tax on financial transactions; could you give us your exact political position on this matter? Next, I should like to draw your attention to trade policy. It is the Council that gives the Commission the mandate to negotiate on the Union’s behalf. It is a competence of the Union, and we, the European Parliament, have a new political competence to approve treaties on trade. I should like to draw your attention to the need to avoid being naïve and the need to apply the principle of reciprocity; for example, will proposals on negotiations with Mercosur be exchanged at the end of your Presidency? I would advise you to be very careful. Finally, with regard to growth, when President Van Rompuy came to tell us about the last European Council, I proposed holding a special European Council entirely dedicated to growth. You are a Member of the European Council, with a special position. President Schulz wishes to be invited to the European Council; will you support us on the presence of our President at the European Council and on the need to have a true European Council dedicated entirely to growth? I wanted to talk about social convergence but my speaking time has run out. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 I regret the European Parliament’s final position on the legislative resolution of 14 December 2011 on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of a Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial compensation provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco. I also regret the added opposition to the provisional renewal of the agreement, with some objections being purely political in nature and nothing to do with fishing. I recognise the excellent work done by my colleague, Alain Cadec, MEP, who is a member of the Committee on Fisheries. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution of 14 December 2011 on the impact of the financial crisis on the defence sector in the EU Member States. I am committed to defending the notion that a common research policy can, and must, be an essential component in building an industrial base for defence. In the absence of a common European industrial defence policy, the defence market has become very fragmented in terms of demand, supply, regulations and standards. I am pleased that, at my behest, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, having been asked for its opinion on this report, took the view that a European industrial defence policy would be valuable in reinforcing the European Union’s role on the world stage and maintaining Europe’s technological capacity, while also taking into account the specificities in each Member State. Cross-border and transatlantic industrial cooperation can facilitate access to new technologies, promote advanced product development and encourage the adoption of effective measures to reduce costs. The financial crisis means that it is not viable to build a European defence industry at a national level. I welcome the work done by Mr Danjean, as Chair of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence.

 I voted in favour of the resolution of the European Parliament of 14 December 2011 on the next EU-Russia Summit. I regret the fact that my proposal of January 2011 to invite the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, to speak at a formal sitting of the European Parliament, which was accepted by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), was turned down by the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament. The Russian Federation is an important neighbour. Five Member States of the European Union share a border with it. Between Europe and Russia, there have been centuries of relations marked by remarkable successes, but also immense suffering. Our common history is indisputable. It derives from the evolution of our respective peoples, the rise and fall of empires, the links between the royal families, culture, the arts, writers, religions, especially Christianity, military combat against fascism, positioning in respect of communism, and so on. Today, Russia has been overtaken by the success of China and is rediscovering its Western roots. It is and will be the essential link in the dialogue between the West and the East, which will serve as a basis for political negotiations aimed at establishing future global governance.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, I should like to begin by saying a few words about currencies. The 19th century was dominated by the pound sterling, the 20th century by the dollar; in the 21st century, we have no idea how currencies will be organised. This was one of the issues tabled by the President of the G20. We have a duty to manage our currency. Traditionally, we had one currency per State. We are experimenting with a currency for a region, a supranational currency. The creation of this economic area of 26 States is good news, Presidents and Heads of State or Government. Hungary has changed its mind, and Denmark is uniting with the euro area even though it was not obliged to do so. This is good news! The United Kingdom is a major European country. We know why it has not joined the euro area: because of its financial services industry, as you said, Mr President. It is also because, in reality, it does not want the financial transaction tax, on which a political consensus is in the process of being reached. The second piece of good news concerns financial stability. All of our great democracies, with the exception of Greece, which is a special case – the conclusions say as much – have changed their government, have taken serious measures in relation to financial governance. We are putting plans in place to ensure the financial stability of our continent. This is good news. I do not believe in such a thing as contagion. We have to consolidate the golden rules and reform our Stability and Growth Pact. There are two issues that have not been resolved. The first is growth. Mr President, I believe the time has come to hold a special European Council in order to examine growth conditions and the terms of a major European investment plan. The second issue concerns the huge disappointment of democrats. Contrary to what was written in Ms Merkel and President Sarkozy’s letter, there has been no mention whatsoever of a parliamentary dimension. The Heads of State or Governments’ failure to add a parliamentary dimension to economic governance is plain wrong! I suggest you do something about it.

 Mr President, I share your point of view. I did not understand the question, but I think that we are in agreement, Mr Koumoutsakos. I think that the issue to be dealt with concerns the broad guidelines on growth set by the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States. That is why I would reiterate my proposal: a future European Council should set broad guidelines on growth. In truth, we know what the two broad guidelines are. The first, as the Commission President mentioned, is a major plan for investing in infrastructure via project bonds. The second is an internal market that can be more than 27 national markets, with flexicurity, and in which we will find the one or two growth points that we need, both to pay off our debts and to finance social progress with the economic prosperity we will create.

 Mr President, we are in the process of holding consultations on the nominations of the Members of the Court of Auditors. I would remind you that the Court of Auditors of the European Union is composed of 27 Members. Under Article 286 of the Treaty, the Members shall be appointed by the Council after it has consulted Parliament. Today, we are holding a consultation, which will be referred to the Council. Therefore, the governments are the ones that propose candidates, and the European Parliament provides an opinion. There is a total of eight candidates, proposed by eight States: Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Sweden. Four of those States – Belgium, Italy, Denmark and Spain – have recently seen a change of government. Two States – Denmark and Spain – with elections, and two – Belgium and Italy – without. In one of those four States, the Kingdom of Spain, the political forces have changed – I was at the summit of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in Marseille – whereas the other three States have made no demands. On the subject of Spain, the Spanish political forces have asked me to request that Parliament postpone the vote – as is possible under Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure – in order to give them time to assess the situation. The King of Spain is due to appoint the government next week. The request being put to our Parliament is to postpone the vote, and it has come from the PPE Group, Mr President. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 I voted in favour of revising the multiannual financial framework to address additional financing needs of the ITER project. The figure stands at EUR 1.3 billion. My first words will be to commend the huge effort made by Alain Lamassoure, Chair of the Committee on Budgets, to gather everyone’s views while emphasising the European interest and that of the European people. Like the generations before us, we know that we will overcome the challenges we face by drawing on mankind’s scientific expertise. This is the case where energy is concerned. Furthermore, there was an urgent need to send a message to our international partners on this remarkable project telling them that we can deliver on our commitments. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to congratulate the rapporteur, my friend Jean Březina, on his excellent work. The European Council meeting of 4 February 2011, known as the EU ‘Energy’ Council, adopted an ambitious European energy policy, intended to assure the people of Europe that they would have safe, sustainable energy at the best price, whose supply would be guaranteed and which would contribute to Europe’s competitiveness. This policy, born out of the Europe 2020 strategy, provides for investment in the development of low-carbon technologies. Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are included in these energy technologies that we Europeans must maintain, develop and implement. We must do so all the more since we are the undisputed and world-recognised leaders in this field thanks to our businesses, our universities, our engineers, our specialist workers and our research centres. I should like Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, to congratulate the European Commission, for having quickly tabled this proposal on 7 March 2011, before the tragedy at Fukushima. I should like to support this proposal for five reasons. First, it aligns the schedules for research programmes with the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013. Second, it stresses safety, which is an essential component of the confidence that the operators of this form of energy have a duty to provide to our fellow citizens. We are pleased that the Union can continue to invest in the area of safety, which is evolving with advances in science and the expectations of our fellow citizens. Third, this proposal allows us to maintain our status as world leaders in the nuclear sciences. Fourth, we are supporting our universities, our research centres and, notably, I want to emphasise this, the European Joint Research Centre, all of which are doing a remarkable job. Finally, it allows us to resolve a part of the cost of the ITER project, which is going to demonstrate the industrial feasibility of producing electricity by nuclear fusion. This will allow us to honour our international commitments to our partners in the ITER project – China, the United States, Russia, Japan and South Korea. Well done, Commissioner, you have our support and thanks. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, my first words will be to echo the compliments made to the Court of Auditors, to President Caldeira, and to Commissioner Šemeta. I am disappointed that the Council is not here, since it is the second budgetary branch, and I join my colleagues in saying that within the shared management, this is where we have the highest error rate, and the Council is not here to discuss this. Need I remind you that we refused to grant discharge to the Council? The least we could expect is that this institution be here today. I would like to say a few words on the DAS, which is the statement of assurance. This is an obligation under the Treaty. I would like to know, Mr President, Commissioner, whether we have a positive or negative DAS. I should also like to congratulate Ms Kaljulaid for her work in presenting the DAS opinion. Regarding the annual accounts, we have an unqualified certification opinion. I must say that I cannot get used to the fact that we are not entering in the accounts the EUR 30 billion that Member States owe us in respect of pensions, in application of accounting standards in the public sector. On the underlying transactions, we have two opinions and one observation. I therefore believe that we need to make progress so that we in Parliament know what is the general opinion on the accounts and underlying transactions. Finally, I think that the number of tests is far from enough: Two-hundred and thirty-eight in agriculture, 90 in outside access. I believe we need to analyse whether this number of tests is sufficient and once again, I would like to reiterate the proposal whereby the European Court of Auditors relies on national courts of auditors for its opinion on shared management, as authorised by the Treaty.

 Mr President, President of the European Commission, President of the European Council, I would like to welcome you as you are a great European democrat and European democracy finds its expression in this House. This House is your home. I would like to make two or three comments. Firstly, we are not in a crisis of the euro. The euro is not the problem. The euro is the solution. We are not in a crisis of Europe. Europe is not the problem, it is the solution. The problem is the indebtedness of Member States. You have protected the financial stability of the Member States at the level of the euro area and the European Union, and I thank you for that. We should ask ourselves the following question: what would have happened had we not had the euro? The franc, the escudo, the peseta would all have been devalued by between 10 and 35%, the Greek drachma by 40%, and the Deutschmark would have been re-valued by 20%. Let us reflect on this question and recognise that we are extremely lucky to have the euro, which is a solid currency, with vast foreign exchange reserves, which are respected on a global scale. The truth is that we are making progress towards greater European Union and, as the European Council of 23 October stated, towards a growth strategy with the single market. We shall enter the G20 summit with our heads held high. As Jean-Pierre Jouyet has written, too bad indeed if the financial markets end up imposing political Europe in an example of major historical irony. It is very good news that we are making progress towards this political Europe that we all want. Jean-Pierre Audy,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, my first words must be to congratulate our rapporteurs, Ms Gräßle and Mr Rivellini, as well as the rapporteurs for the groups, who have all done important work. The first thing I want to mention is simplification, and I would like to thank both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for having moved towards simplification. Both citizens and central and local government bodies are at the end of their tether. Every time we see an increase in the error rate, it is because the rules are too complicated. I warmly thank you, therefore, for the Cohesion Fund resources, and for the research that has been done, continuing on from Mr Carvalho’s excellent report. I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for having agreed to introduce a measure of consistency, by allowing the use of international accounting standards applicable to the public sector in future. We had to put an end to this inconsistency whereby the EU’s accountants made their own rules. Thank you also for having looked into shortening the timescale for granting discharge. It is only given after 16 months, which is far too long. I will end by mentioning two other subjects. The first is the national declarations: I have a lot of reservations about these. I believe we ought to discuss the matter from both the political and technical points of view, to make sure that these declarations are in keeping with international auditing standards applicable to the public sector. In auditing, we never ask for declarations of assurance from managing authorities. We ask them for representation letters stating that nothing has been concealed, but not letters of assurance. It is not the job of ministers to perform audits. What is more, in the Member States that have agreed to the principle, the error rates are no lower than in other countries. To conclude, I would like to thank the committees for having agreed to the principle of an investment section within the European Union, in order to keep investment operations separate. We will at last be able to have a budget framework for our major investment projects, such as GALILEO or ITER, which are planned over periods that go well beyond the annual framework, or even the financial perspective. Another significant step forward that is within sight in terms of budget presentation is the inclusion of the future project bonds in our accounting system, and the establishment of a major European investment plan to help growth within the Union.

 Mr President, well done Mr Barroso, you have a balanced and apt view of the seriousness of the situation and of the common solutions that need to be found. I have listened carefully to the criticisms on the methods. Today, in this House, there are notable absentees: our Heads of State or Government. I have the following dream: that we would have a great political debate on the state of the Union, with the European Commission in its entirety – that is the case – representatives of the people, Heads of State or Government with their representatives, and President Van Rompuy. I would like to ask the heads of the political groups: did we invite Mr Van Rompuy? Did we invite the Heads of State or Government, as well as representatives of the national parliaments? There is a European Council on 17 October. It will be a momentous political moment. We must put your proposals on the table, Mr Barroso, we must have a big political debate with President van Rompuy, who could prepare this European Council session, at our mini part-session in Brussels on 13 October.

 A modern and effective infrastructure is of key importance for achieving the Europe 2020 objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as reducing unemployment, through the completion of the internal market. To this end, the Commission has proposed a ‘Connecting Europe Facility’ (CEF) for the next financial framework in order to accelerate infrastructure development in the fields of transport, energy and information and communication technology (ICT) networks, with particular emphasis on strategic cross-border aspects. In addition to equity instruments and grants, the CEF includes a new financial instrument to mobilise more private sector funding, as well as project bonds. However, the initial report by the Committee on Budgets and the subsequent negotiations with the Council focused on a limited number of issues including, for example, defining project bonds and evaluating the facility. Nevertheless, I welcome the proposals made in this report, which encourages projects in the fields of transport, energy and trans-European networks. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 Launched in 2009, the Baltic Sea macro-region brings together a coherent set of territories that want to cooperate in order to find better solutions to the economic and environmental problems facing them. This cooperation has taken the form of a ‘macro-regional strategy’, designed to coordinate the existing extensive sectoral cooperation and based on four pillars – environment, prosperity, accessibility and security – and an action plan setting out 15 priority areas and 80 flagship projects. The entire Mediterranean basin shares the same natural environment, and its shores are connected by the same history and culture. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which cannot be seized without the coordination and overview permitted by the definition of a macro-regional strategy. In terms of developing potential, maritime traffic must be placed at the heart of a transport strategy for the whole area, particularly for goods. The report also underlines the possibility of boosting the southern dimension of the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy, taking on a concrete territorial dimension which would guarantee greater management of migration flows and impact positively on the performance of the economies of the countries concerned.

 For the majority of the European Union’s neighbours, in other words, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, the EU is the main export market and the main source of imports. Therefore, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area is the most important and most effective instrument at our disposal for strengthening our trade links. The gradual dismantling of trade barriers and regulatory convergence in areas that have an impact on trade are rightly included in this Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. Beyond the economic aspect, free trade areas can be a core component of a wider political agreement, leading, in particular, to an association agreement. The rapporteur also stresses that, with the signature of agreements and the creation of the free trade area, the European Union might also provide its assistance and strengthen the role of civil society or even steer reforms, both in the public and private sectors. My vote in favour of the Ransdorf report applauds its social and democratic goals, which are fundamental aspects of our partnerships. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 On 30 September 2011, the Board of Governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) voted in favour of the necessary amendments to the agreement establishing the EBRD to enable it to expand its region of operations to the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. The report by Mr Binev explains that, in response to the political and economic situation in the countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean, the EBRD has developed a phased approach to the start of its activities. This report gives the European Union much more room for manoeuvre in its cooperation with the countries surrounding the Mediterranean. In fact, the EU representatives in the EBRD should encourage the bank to contribute to the transition towards open market economies by promoting social inclusion and energy efficiency, while taking into account the social, poverty, civil and human rights context. My work at European level has exactly the same goal: that of helping and supporting the Mediterranean countries during their democratic transitions following the wave of revolutions associated with the Arab Spring and during their political and economic transitions.

 The European Union is the principal donor of development aid, the principal investor and the second largest trade partner in Latin America. Latin America has not been hit as hard by the financial and economic crisis as the European economies, with a +4.5% growth outlook for 2012. Unfortunately, 180 million people are still living below the poverty threshold in Latin America. It was therefore important to define a new cooperation with Latin America, in particular, by changing the tools to help this cooperation. Indeed, as the rapporteur recommends, the focus should be on the gradual withdrawal of bilateral aid to middle income countries (MICs) in order to reinforce aid to low income countries (LICs). Faced with the humanitarian and health situation of Latin American countries, it is vital that essential services such as education, training, health and hygiene, removed by the European Commission, are reprioritised. Finally, and as a driving force behind the future of this cooperation, regional policies need to be stimulated in order to reset budgetary and fiscal policies. I voted for this report in order to highlight the need to shift the focus of regional cooperation policies onto urgent health and humanitarian matters. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 As the world’s largest importer of energy, it is now time for the European Union to define a European energy policy in order to provide more effective guidelines for energy use, both within and beyond our borders. The report emphasises, in particular, certain key concepts such as better coordination, diversification, energy sustainability/viability and stronger partnerships with supplier countries. Priority is given to important areas such as the major energy networks and infrastructures, strategic dialogues and international partnerships. It is also important to be able to exchange information, with the establishment of a platform for that purpose, and learn about European and third-country projects in the field of energy. I voted for this report in order to support a vital aspect: improving cooperation with third countries on energy and infrastructures. This multilateral cooperation will help to consolidate the partnerships with third countries in several areas; innovation and research into building reliable networks and facilities will ensure that the European Union has a diversified supply.

 Bluefin tuna stocks in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean have fallen dramatically over the years, and urgent action is needed to protect them. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), to which the EU is a contracting party under the common commercial policy, adopted a new recommendation at its annual meeting in 2010. The amendments include reducing the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and strengthening control measures used to implement a recovery plan. I am therefore in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 concerning a multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. The financial returns on fishing are so high that they actively encourage illegal fishing and other illegal activities. The time has come, therefore, to reassess the management measures adopted by ICCAT and to adapt them to current activities. It is also high time that the European Union acted quickly on its own initiative and as a precautionary measure to protect bluefin tuna and to rebuild stocks. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The European Commission has put the proposal for a financial transaction tax (FTT) at the centre of the debate, particularly in response to the serious consequences of the financial crisis. Ms Podimata’s report proposes to make the financial sector bear a share of the costs of the crisis, to dissuade financial establishments from taking excessive risks, to supplement regulatory measures aimed at preventing future crises and, finally, to generate additional revenue to finance the EU’s general budgets through the enrichment of the residence principle and the removal of pension funds or institutions for occupational retirement provision from the list of financial institutions to which the FTT would be applicable. The report puts forward strong arguments in favour of the application of the FTT at EU level. I am therefore in favour of this proposal. However, the report does not address the management of the revenue from the FTT and opts to have it managed by the multiannual financial framework programme. The FTT would make a significant contribution to the EU’s own resources, thereby broadening the framework for financing specific policies, projects and public goods. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 It was in 1985 that the European Union and China signed the first bilateral cooperation agreement. However, after almost 30 years of partnership, there is still a significant imbalance in trade relations between the EU and China. The list of these disharmonies shows worrying signs: access to Chinese public procurement is limited for foreign enterprises, protection of intellectual property is weak, there are systematic restrictions on the exportation of Chinese rare earths to European industries and, finally, the undervaluation and non-convertibility of the yuan pose a serious problem. Reciprocity, the cornerstone of the agreement, seems no longer, or insufficiently, present in trade relations. European enterprises are currently unable to invest in China under conditions similar to those governing Chinese investors in Europe. My vote in favour of the report by Ms de Sarnez lends support to the proposals made to rebalance EU-Chinese relations. It is also important to provide compliant protection tools and measures to update the terms of this agreement between the EU and China. Finally, we need to address the lack of transparency and reciprocal competition, which sours Sino-European relations today. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The Arab Spring represents an unprecedented revolution in the Mediterranean world. These revolutions have redefined the relationships between the Southern Mediterranean and the European Union, and have built a new trading partnership, founded on fundamental values such as human rights and democracy. This partnership must therefore be consolidated through the establishment of a free trade area, regional integration and a trade strategy. We have a unique opportunity to cooperate in the fields of employment and growth, to step up regional integration and the presence of the European Union through its trade, investment and financing activities. The report reaffirms trade as a solid pillar in the European Neighbourhood Policy, and as a means of involving SMEs by making them an additional tool for economic democratisation. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 There is no doubt that this draft resolution on maritime piracy strengthens the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP). Indeed, maritime transport has been a key vehicle for European economic growth, and not just growth in Europe, as more than three quarters of world trade is carried by sea. The European Union therefore has a genuine interest in ensuring that security is a factor in the common maritime policy. Over recent years, we have seen in the news a resurgence of criminal acts at sea. We find the greatest number of acts of maritime piracy in targeted areas, often concentrated in the Red Sea, and through which large numbers of European and international transport and trading vessels pass. Most of these acts remain unpunished. That is why this motion for a resolution is essential because it calls again for immediate and effective measures against impunity of this nature and calls for the need for strategic coordination between the European Union and third countries.

 Water is a resource for humankind and access to water is fundamental. Due to climate change, there are fears of a decline in the quantity and quality of water available, particularly drinking water, as well as a rise in the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. It is therefore necessary to rationalise water use and the European Parliament’s motion for a resolution calls for more efficient water usage especially in the sectors where most water is used, such as the agriculture sector. Also, the resolution underlines the need to make concrete commitments towards the promotion and protection of water resources, especially in light of the upcoming Rio+20 conference. That is why I voted for this resolution during the very week when the World Water Forum was taking place in Marseille. Jean Roatta  (PPE

The report underlines the importance of taking concrete steps to achieve gender parity in elected offices in the national parliaments and in the European Parliament. We should aim to achieve parity in electoral lists. The report also proposes measures designed to ensure parity within the European Commission, the EEAS and other political and administrative bodies. It is because I am conscious of the importance of parity for the exercise of democracy in Europe, and the current imbalance in that regard, that I voted in favour of this report, in the hope that progress will at last be made.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the signature of the agreement between the European Union and Morocco concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures on agricultural products and fishery products has an economic dimension and, above all, a political dimension. The agreement with Morocco represents support for the rural development policy, support for local farmers as well as support for the democratic process that was initiated several months ago after the parliamentary election. This agricultural agreement is therefore a major component of the advanced status granted to the Kingdom of Morocco in 2008. It also shows that the EU supports and encourages the programme of constitutional and democratic reforms in Morocco. Over and above the economic dimension, this agreement will formally enshrine the rapprochement between the European Union and Morocco. The credibility of the European Union is at stake. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot maintain bilateral relations that merely limp along. That is why I would encourage you to vote in favour of the signature of this agreement. It is a balanced, coherent agreement, which we need so that we can open as soon as possible the negotiations on a free trade agreement. Jean Roatta  (PPE
),

 The European Union is the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid. In 2010, the European Union’s contribution totalled EUR 2.957 billion, and 36% of that aid came from the Commission. The Commission manages its humanitarian activities from its headquarters in Brussels and with the help of a network of local offices all around the world. The average annual budget managed by DG ECHO for its humanitarian aid activities between 2006 and 2010 was EUR 889 million. The report focuses on the following key issues: efficiency and effectiveness of the ECHO control, monitoring and supervision system, especially when framework partnership agreement (FPA) partners or international organisation partners (such as the United Nations) are involved. The report also underlines the need to ensure the sustainability, coherence and complementarity of humanitarian actions, which are key objectives of the EU’s development policy. I therefore voted in favour of this report. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The Committee on Development, on which I sit, worked with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, which was responsible for this report on women’s situation in war. This report deals with the responsibility of women in peace negotiations as well as the impact of armed conflict across the globe on women. The report recommends the creation of a post of Special EU Representative on Women within the European External Action Service (EEAS) and calls on the Member States to put in place action plans to improve the situation of women in conflict countries. As I agree fully with the actions to be taken to improve the situation of women, I voted in favour of this report. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The objective of ‘universal access to energy by 2030’ was launched in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In developing countries, households generally spend a high percentage of their budget on the purchase of low-quality fuels for heating and cooking compared with households with access to electricity and to liquid and gas fuels. In developing countries, sustainable energy access for the poor faces a number of barriers, notably: the inability of the poor to pay for the services, investment costs, connection costs and no national capacity to produce the energy generation equipment and spare parts required. The report stresses that, whilst none of the MDGs are specifically related to energy, access to modern, sustainable energy services for all is a prerequisite for achieving the MDGs. We now need to bring energy to the fore in the debate on the eradication of poverty, by establishing a specific programme focusing on ‘energy and development’ within the framework of the European Union’s development cooperation policy. It is for these priorities that I voted in favour of this report. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

 As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development on Mr Gallagher’s report, I thought it was important to point out that when the European Commission wants to impose sanctions on a country for unsustainable fishing practices, it should take into account that country’s level of development. This is because, according to the principle of policy coherence with development goals, it is crucial, in my opinion, that the measures adopted for fisheries do not undermine the development plans and strategies implemented by the European Union in these countries. Mr Gallagher’s draft report takes up this important idea for our Committee on Development specifying that the measures should not be unjustified, or even discriminatory. I therefore call on the European Commission, when it adopts such measures, to respect this principle of policy coherence with development objectives and to duly consider the level of development and the vulnerability of countries. Maurice Ponga  (PPE
),

 In an effort to promote and to allow access to energy in developing countries insofar as this access contributes to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), I feel that it is important for the European Parliament to respond to the United Nations General Assembly’s declaration of 2012 as the ‘International Year of Sustainable Energy for All’. However, Norbert Neuser’s politically biased report refuses developing countries the right to be free to choose their energy policy by calling on ‘the Commission and the Member States neither to fund nor to otherwise encourage the use of nuclear power in developing countries’. I therefore voted against this paragraph which imposes choices on developing countries by limiting the energy sources to which they can have access. Nuclear power is a clean energy source that could give millions of citizens in developing countries access to basic services such as mains electricity. Maurice Ponga,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, we will give our verdict for the third time on the new development cooperation instrument (DCI) providing for Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM) for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) banana-producing countries following the reduction in tariff preferences. This aid programme has a budget of EUR 190 million and is intended to support 10 ACP countries until 2013. It is crucially important for our African and Caribbean partners, since the banana sector is of considerable economic and social importance in these countries. I bitterly regret the fact that not all of Parliament’s demands concerning the use of delegated acts have been accepted for this instrument. We have nevertheless managed to make progress. Indeed, the text outlines clear objectives and specific criteria for the allocation of resources to the Commission. The Commission has also made a statement specifying how these criteria will be applied. Moreover, we have a statement from the Council regarding the next Multiannual Financial Framework, specifying that the latter will take due account of delegated acts in external aid instruments post-2013. Finally, Parliament states in its resolution – and this is a crucial point in my view – that the outcome of this conciliation does not set any kind of precedent. I have just come back from Togo, where the 22nd session of the ACP-European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly was being held, and I believe I can say that our ACP partners are counting on us, given the urgency of the situation. The funds ought to have been released two years ago. We must be aware of the terrible consequences for our ACP partners should the DCI/BAM Regulation be rejected. The situation of some farmers is catastrophic. We cannot wait any longer and must act accordingly. I am therefore counting on you to endorse this text. Maurice Ponga,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development.

 Mr President, I wanted to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Ms Lövin, on her excellent work. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development, I am pleased that the Committee on Fisheries has taken up the points contained in our opinion, because it is vital for the development dimension to be taken into account in the measures to combat illegal fishing at the global level, for the sake of policy coherence and the close links with development policy. Indeed, combating illegal fishing requires global solutions and the involvement of all countries, including developing ones. However, countries’ technical and financial capabilities also need to be taken into account in the actions to be undertaken. The same constraints cannot be imposed on developed and developing countries without support measures. Small island states have very limited capabilities, for example. Therefore, they must be supported in their efforts to combat illegal fishing. That is why the Union will have to increase the budget for the fisheries sector when it signs agreements in this area in developing countries. Furthermore, it is vital to ensure that the measures to combat illegal fishing are actually applied, because this practice harms the development of countries insofar as it reduces the financial resources they could earn from fishing as an economic activity. The fact is, developing countries need those resources to implement social, economic and education policies. Lastly, it is important for the European Union, when implementing these measures to combat illegal fishing in developing countries, to encourage the involvement of civil society and businesses alongside the countries receiving aid. A holistic approach needs to be taken to halt the scourge of illegal fishing. Maurice Ponga  (PPE
).

 Madam President, I wanted to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Kaczmarek, on his excellent work. It is important that every year, the European Parliament take stock of the work of the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), insofar as this assembly plays a determining role in enhancing the North-South dialogue and in implementing a development policy that is founded on partnership and exchange. 2010 was an eventful year for the JPA, which met twice – as previous speakers have said – in Spain and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to discuss, among other things, the impact of climate change in ACP countries, the impact of the global crisis, freedom and independence of the media, and food security. In 2010, the JPA also sent the first election observation mission of this parliamentary term. I had the honour of co-chairing this mission in Burundi for the presidential elections with Mr Assarid, a Malian MP. This election observation mission was a real success. We were able to meet all the political players involved and thanks to the dual origin of this delegation, both ACP and European, we embodied a different legitimacy from European and African missions. I therefore call on the JPA Bureau to renew this experience, since it will make it possible to put into practice solidarity and the special relations that unite the European Union and ACP countries.

 I am glad that Parliament is stating its views on the current EU-Canada trade negotiations and outlining its priorities in this regard. Canada is undoubtedly a trade partner of the EU, but it is imperative that we in Parliament relay the concerns of our fellow citizens located both on European territory and in regions forming part of the European family, namely, the protection and defence of their interests. By ‘European family’, I mean the overseas countries and territories (OCT), which, although not strictly European territories, maintain a special relationship with the European Union, and, in particular, with the Member States of which they are part. In the trade negotiations currently under way, it is the archipelago of St Pierre and Miquelon, next door to Canada, that is particularly affected. I therefore call on the Commission, during the negotiations, to defend and protect the interests of that overseas country and territory situated in the North Atlantic Ocean. Maurice Ponga,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will today give its verdict for a second time on the amendment to the financing instrument for development cooperation providing for the establishment of Banana Accompanying Measures for the main ACP banana-producing countries. These accompanying measures are justified by the reduction in tariff preferences granted to the ACP countries following the conclusion, in December 2009, of the Geneva Agreement with the United States and the countries of Latin America. The European Union made a commitment at that time to provide EUR 190 million in support to the ACP countries to help them cope with this new competition. We amended both the form and the content of the Commission proposal at first reading. The Council disagreed with us on the form, which is why the regulation has been submitted for a second reading today. Indeed, the Council refused to allow the delegated acts procedure to be applied to strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes, and hence refused to implement the advances of the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament decided to react quickly, and that is crucial. We are therefore sending a strong political message to the ACP countries. The European Parliament is behind them and is doing everything in its power to ensure that the EUR 190 million are released as quickly as possible. Yet we are also sending a message to the Council. The European Parliament is defending its prerogatives as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. The ball is now in the Council’s court. The European Union made a commitment to the ACP countries. The Council should therefore shoulder its responsibilities, as Parliament has done. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question (Rule 149(8)) Maurice Ponga  (PPE

 Thank you for your question, Lord Dartmouth. All I would say is that there are international agreements in place that require the European Union to invest in its relations with the ACP countries, and this is one of the agreements that the European Union must prioritise.

 I welcome the European Parliament’s decision to approve the interim agreement between the European Union and the Pacific States. This agreement reflects the commitment of the European Union to this region of the world and sends a strong political signal to the States in the region. I am pleased about that. The political resolution that accompanies this decision to approve the agreement provides an opportunity to point out our demands. We want to establish a balanced and fair relationship with the Pacific States; one which allows for the development of these island States while protecting the interests of our own citizens. While the interim agreement includes specific provisions on the rules of origin for fishery products, it was important to manage this derogation. Indeed, in order to ensure that this derogation, which should allow for the creation of jobs and wealth, is of genuine benefit to local populations and does not harm the European fishery product processing and canning industries, it was vital to provide for an assessment of its impact as soon as possible and to allow for its suspension, where necessary. Guarantees exist to ensure that the agreement is fair and that measures will be taken, if necessary, to protect our interests. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many years, the European Union has maintained a special and strong relationship with ACP countries. This special relationship has resulted, in particular, in the granting of tariff preferences. Such is the case for the banana sector, in which ACP countries have benefited from a preferential trading arrangement for their exports to the European Union. This preference has been challenged at the WTO, especially by the Latin American countries, which are large exporters of bananas. Therefore, in order to comply with WTO rules and to end a long dispute, the European Union accepted to reduce its tariffs in the banana sector in December 2009. On account of the privileged partnership that it maintains with ACP countries, the European Union nonetheless wanted to help banana-producing ACP countries to cope with this increased competition. Consequently, Europe has pledged EUR 190 million until 2013 to help banana-producing ACP countries to adapt, be competitive and restructure their sector if need be. In the report on which we will vote tomorrow, the European Parliament is reaffirming its commitment to, and support for, banana-producing ACP countries, and I very much welcome that. Thus, we have suggested, among other things, that the European Union could adopt complementary measures after 2013 if necessary. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleague Mrs Morin-Chartier and the other Members have said, on 27 and 28 February the violent storm Xynthia battered several French regions, claiming 53 lives and causing huge material damage. The storm was exceptionally intense; it caused devastating floods along the French coast. After Madeira, Europe has once again been affected. Brittany, the region of my colleague and friend, Mr Cadec, has been severely affected. A state of natural disaster has thus been declared in three French regions: Brittany, Poitou-Charentes and Pays de la Loire. In the face of these disasters, the European Union must demonstrate its responsiveness and express its solidarity. Words and a resolution alone will not enable us to support the victims of these disasters; we must also and above all provide financial aid. I therefore call on the European Commission – and my colleague Mr Béchu supports my request – to swiftly release the EU Solidarity Fund so as to help the disaster areas cope with the damage. This disaster shows that Mr Barnier’s proposal to create a European civil protection force is relevant. Europeans must take action together, since more and more disasters are occurring and they are affecting our European territories and, in particular, our most isolated and vulnerable regions, such as the islands in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean islands.

 I welcome the adoption, today, by a large majority (558 votes to 57), of the report by Mr van Nistelrooij. By adopting this report, Parliament is sending out a strong message to citizens and is responding to the social concerns relayed in particular by Eurocities. The report provides for the possibility of using the ERDF for the renovation and replacement of existing buildings and for new structures designed to help marginalised communities in rural or urban environments in each of the 27 Member States. This extension from the 12 States that joined in 2000 and 2007 to all the Member States offers solutions to the problems that insalubrious housing poses for certain marginalised communities throughout the EU. It will thus be possible to establish an integrated and sustainable approach at EU level. Furthermore, this extension dovetails perfectly with the aim of the 2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. I am pleased that Parliament has voted for these amendments and I hope that the regions concerned will find it a useful tool for solving what is an urgent and fundamental problem for these communities.

Mr President, thanks to the tenacity of the Swedish Presidency, which I too thank, we have the Treaty of Lisbon. However, a treaty such as this is not a project, but a tool, a toolbox to serve the European project, and it is therefore up to the men and women who manage the institutions – the Commission, its president, the Council – and to us here to make good use of these tools in the future, at the end of a transition period that has been long, too long. For we are now better equipped to take up three major challenges in the face of which, ladies and gentlemen, we will together be playing not only for the credibility of the European Union, but also, to repeat the word used by Mr Havel just now, for its sovereignty. The first challenge is that of the crisis, and we must not – we cannot – come out of it as we went into it, as if nothing had happened. There are lessons to be learnt in our dialogue with the United States, in particular, regarding governance, regarding solidarity, regarding transparency and regulation of the global economy, and for we Europeans there are lessons to be learnt as regards the safeguarding – I use that word deliberately – the consolidation of the internal market, in the ‘reconciliation of the market and society’, to repeat a word that I have adopted as my own, used by Mario Monti, to whom President Barroso has moreover usefully entrusted a task on this issue. The second challenge is that of green growth. In Kyoto, we took the lead on this issue, thanks to the European Commission. We must maintain this position by ensuring, of course, that our partners, the other large countries, the large regions, adopt a reciprocal attitude. And then, the third challenge is for us to be at the table, not ‘behind the table’, but ‘at the table’, of those who are going to decide on the world order – or disorder – over the next 20 years. This is not easy when we number 27 nations, but it is crucial all the same, unless we do not mind – which I personally do – being subcontractors or being under the influence of the other countries. This is why we have a great deal of confidence in the future work of the High Representative, whose job it will be to create a real common diplomatic and strategic culture. Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the sooner we are ready, the better it will be for European citizens. That is why we eagerly and confidently await the decisions that you will take. Michel Barnier  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Mr Barroso, there are several elements to, and reasons for, our show of confidence and our very clear vote tomorrow. The first element is that of democratic consistency: with regard to the choice of the 27 Heads of State or Government who chose you unanimously; with regard to what we said during the electoral campaign – it was not so long ago – and with regard to the citizens’ vote. We are not going to apologise for having won the elections, even though we are aware – we are well aware, I would say to our fellow Members – that we will have to surround you with more ideas than those of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) alone. Then, there is democratic consistency with regard to the exercise that you have been conducting for several weeks, in the demanding, sincere and humble dialogue with Parliament, and we are here to bear witness to it. There is a second reason, which is a conviction: the very strong conviction that there will be no strong policies in Europe if the institutions are weak. We need strong institutions. This is why we hope that the Treaty of Lisbon will be ratified. It is a tool box that will make the institutions work. We need a strong Commission that can confront the crisis as quickly as possible. The third reason is a contract of confidence that we have signed with you. In the face of this, the most serious and most profound economic, financial, food – let us not forget the one billion starving people in the world – and environmental crisis, we need the Commission to show its fighting spirit. We need you, and us with you, to learn all the lessons from this crisis, in terms of governance, regulation, innovation and new policies – I am thinking of the idea of a European savings bank to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the strategic sectors – and, with regard to the most profound crisis, the environmental crisis, to introduce a new model of economic and social growth, of green growth, as you yourself said. That, Mr Barroso, is why we shall be ready, tomorrow, to sign the contract of confidence with you. Michel Barnier  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should, of course, like to thank Commissioner Dimas for his presence and his answers and for the attention that he continues to pay to all these disasters. We did a great deal of work together when President Barroso asked me to draft a report, which he also mentioned, on the creation of a European civil protection force. I presented this report on 9 May 2006. When I re-read it, and I see all the disasters that have happened, I realise that it is still topical. Mrs Tzavela, obviously, it is not just Greece. Every country is affected, and I would add that there are not only natural disasters, there are also human disasters, caused by mankind. I am thinking of maritime disasters – Erika
 and countless others – and of Chernobyl-type industrial accidents. There are natural disasters other than fires. I am thinking of the tsunami. One day we can expect a tsunami in the Mediterranean such as the one at the start of the 20th century that totally destroyed the city of Messina. Frankly, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tools we are using are not up to these disasters, which are going to increase under the twin effect of global warming and transport. Hence the reason why I think we should be more ambitious. I am grateful to the Commission, to Commissioner Dimas and to all his teams from the Directorate-General that are putting the civil protection mechanism into operation. I believe that we must go further. It is conceivable to have enhanced cooperation with those Member States that want it. If there are not 27 of us to make up this civil protection force, let us start with 12 or 15 of us. Then you will see that this affects everyone. When I compile the list of disasters, I can say that everyone is affected: the floods that hit Germany in 2002, the major pandemics and also terrorism. That, Commissioner, is why I would like the Commission to take the initiative to go further, to propose that the Member States go further. Our Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, will support you in these proactive initiatives.

 Controlling production volumes is an essential tool which must be made available to all bodies involved in defending and managing protected designations of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indications (PGI), following the example of the cheese sector with the adoption of the Milk Package in March 2012. This will enable them to maintain a high level of quality and added value in their products and avoid market imbalances. Unfortunately, the Council and the Commission were unable to reach an agreement on this provision, which was supported by a majority in Parliament. However, other points in the quality package represent real progress, for example, in terms of protecting against misuse and shortening procedures. The Council, which is divided on this issue, has nevertheless agreed to confirm in a statement that this debate is not closed, but that it will now be included in the discussions on the reform of the single common market organisation (CMO). That is why I do not wish to call into question the agreement reached with the Council, as this would block the adoption of the text and put the debate on volumes management on hold. I will therefore vote against the amendment authorising this mechanism, which I otherwise fully support. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 Mr President, the 2006 reform was supposed to improve the competitiveness of the sugar beet sector in Europe. This reform was carried out at great sacrifice in terms of men and land. Factories were closed. Whole areas of land had to abandon beet production. Cane sugar refiners are now calling for the suspension of tariffs on sugar without any trade negotiation. Increased imports of cane sugar from other third countries would undermine the preferences granted to our traditional partners in developing countries and could halt investments in these countries. The European Union sugar market is totally open. As far as I am concerned, any delay in investments in African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the least developed countries (LDCs) cannot justify the refiners’ demand to disregard them. As a rapporteur for this House on the common market organisation (CMO) in the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), the ACP countries that I have encountered have explicitly asked me to keep the system in place today. Ladies and gentlemen, this House has already, on a number of occasions, had discussions, regarding, in particular, the Dess report in July 2011 and Resolution No 2010/2110, passed in March 2011. Yes, we must defend jobs. However, under the pretext of defending dozens of industrial jobs, do we need to have more people abandoning our lands with the removal of European producers? For three years now, is it not the case that our Parliament has, all too often, affirmed and reaffirmed its determination to defend our food self-sufficiency and to promote our agriculture as much as possible?

 After an amazing campaign of misinformation, Parliament has rejected the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). Just one article concerned Internet users.

 We should welcome the adoption of this text as some excellent work has been done. Whilst not entirely perfect, the policy changes are significant in comparison with decisions made in recent years, notably, the measure that gives producers the right to group together so that they gain greater clout in bargaining with processors and distributors. From now on, interprofessional agreements will be an integral part of the European vocabulary, and the right of producers of protected designation of origin (PDO) / protected geographic indication (PGI) cheeses to manage their production volumes has finally been recognised. Other improvements such as, the requirement of contracts in the supply chain, or a mechanism ensuring that disadvantaged regions are not ‘drained’ of their milk production upon the expiry of dairy quotas, must be achieved in the years to come. The ‘soft landing’ promised by the Commissioner at the time of drafting, Ms Fischer Boel, should well and truly become a reality for European producers. From now on, producers must fully embrace the new tools established by European legislation in order to help further their interests and to take part in the running of their market. Michel Dantin,

 Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, we have reached the end of our work. Commissioner, we agree with some of the points you just made. There is one word, however, that I wish to highlight: the word ‘quickly’. I do not think that we can agree on that. It was in February three years ago that the milk crisis erupted or reached its peak. That is how long it has taken us to reach a compromise allowing us to offer milk producers new prospects. I welcome the spirit in which we worked and congratulate our rapporteur, who, for this first, because it was a first for us to legislate together, enabled us to work in a spirit of genuine dialogue and with a shared desire to build something. We are therefore offering producers a new capacity, that of derogating from competition law and organising themselves into stronger units. However, Commissioner, we all know only too well that this is just one stage, just one step, and that we have not yet found the real solution and the real tools to move beyond the era of milk quotas. An exit phase should be prepared. That phase has not yet been designed. We have to continue to work on that aspect. As you said, we have not yet completely resolved the issue of vulnerable regions either. Even if we are offering them a tool, with the possibility of organising themselves better with the geographical protection mechanisms, we are still not enabling them to keep milk in those regions. It is absolutely essential for the report that you are going to submit to us in 2014 to set out solutions that allow us to maintain this activity in vulnerable regions, where grass is often the only production and where milk is often the only way of making a living. Without it, all of the work and all of the hopes that we have put in this text will be in vain for many farmers. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, you fulfil your duties well. You defend a text with conviction. This is not your text, however. It is an inherited text. We know very well that, if you had had to negotiate this text yourself, it would have been different because you are currently involved in the CAP negotiations and you are aware that it is difficult to impose environmental constraints on European farmers when texts such as this proposal ignore that issue completely. You are aware that it is difficult to establish a common framework for the CAP because the standard of living differs from one EU country to another. Here, we are not taking into account the standard of living of Moroccan producers, whom, we are supposed to believe, represent El Dorado. Yes, the situation is complicated as I am sure that nobody here in this House wants to jeopardise Morocco’s development. Morocco is a country that we need for stability in North Africa. Morocco is a gateway for developing new trade and we know that every time we develop new trade, both parties benefit to some extent. However, I will get back to what I was saying about the environment. How are we going to explain to European farmers that we are perhaps going to force them to comply with the Water Framework Directive under the system of cross-compliance but that at the same time we are not going to pay any attention to the production conditions of the tomatoes that are allowed to enter? How are we going to explain to them that the water table is falling by two metres per year in some regions but that that is being ignored? I firmly believe that the model that we are proposing to the Moroccans is not a sustainable model. Perhaps our producers do not have to worry because, with the system they are being offered, Moroccan producers will die before them. This is serious, however. In my opinion, we have to defend Morocco, we have to defend democracy in Morocco but we also have to take care to ensure that what we are proposing is balanced from an environmental, social and economic perspective.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is now three years since the debate on the aid programme for the most deprived got desperately bogged down in Council. This untenable deadlock is not acceptable. It is all the more unacceptable given that the death sentence has been pronounced on the programme at a time when our continent is going through an economic and social crisis of unprecedented violence, which is throwing so many of our fellow citizens into turmoil. Some symbols construct Europe; others weaken it dangerously. Let us ensure that we do not destroy today what was patiently constructed yesterday, especially at a time when the difficulties we face seem to be straining the bonds that unite our States. Those same difficulties are pushing people towards nationalist sentiments and to turn their backs on Europe. Re-establishing the every man for himself principle as a normal and acceptable reflex is far removed from my idea of Europe and from that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), to which I belong. Our people deserve better. They deserve the Europe we have been building together for more than 50 years – a Europe that is more than a simple economic agreement. Quite the opposite, Europe embodies values that, more than ever, we need to embrace – values that place human beings at the top of the political agenda. Today, it is imperative that we move away from sterile legal debate in order to take fair and responsible political decisions. Allocating resources to the European Social Fund within a fund created specifically for that purpose under the revised common agricultural policy is not what the debate is about. It is no longer what the debate is about. The ruling of the Court of Justice has now created an emergency which will soon affect 18 million people receiving food aid. The real question now relates to our common vision of Europe and its future. I am convinced that its destiny does not, under any circumstances, lie in the full or partial renationalisation of food aid, however symbolically. Let there be no mistake: only if we act together will we succeed in tackling the huge challenges we face today. It is only by acting together, showing solidarity and standing united that, on our continent, we will retain the resources to guarantee the future prosperity of all our fellow citizens. Commissioner, you have courageously proposed measures. It is high time that ... (The President cut off the speaker) Michel Dantin,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Dess, the shadow rapporteurs and other contributors on the work that they have done to draft this text. In my opinion, it is both balanced and ambitious. We will be voting on the report tomorrow. Almost six months after Mr Lyon drafted his report setting out the European Parliament’s views on the common agricultural policy (CAP) post-2013, the European Commission decided to draw on the report by including many of its ideas in the communication issued on 18 November 2010. The new report, which was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, affirms the new direction that we would like the common agricultural policy to take in the coming years. Our farmers are not there to produce mere commodities, or wares to sell. They are there, above all, to produce food for Europe’s 500 million citizens, but also to help to feed the rest of the world. Stating it in these terms is not just semantics: it is a philosophical choice that we are making. Mr Dess’s report endorses a positive approach to agriculture’s environmental and ecological contribution and therefore appeals for a reduction of the often onerous administrative procedures generated by European and national legislation. By arguing in favour of graduated direct payments and a review of the regulatory instruments, the report also provides a new perspective on social perception of the CAP and of global trade. As we speak, the G20 in Paris is beginning discussions on regulating the global commodities markets, with particular reference to agricultural commodities. Parliament’s approach, then, has not been defined in a vacuum, where we are cut off from the world. Rather, it is part of the wider deliberations on how to come up with a global response to a global challenge. As with Mr Lyon’s report one year ago and Mr Garriga Polledo’s report on the financial perspectives last month, tomorrow we will be voting in favour of maintaining the agricultural budget for the 2014-2020 programming period. I am sure that it will be a close-run thing, but we do need to take a stand and to make choices, because we will not have the money to do everything ...

 Mr President, I should like to thank the Spanish producers who submitted this timely petition to us. Indeed, for months now, we in Parliament have been warning the Commission of the danger to our internal market of a number of bilateral agreements. Clearly, we are sensitive to the issue of Morocco’s development. Clearly, we know that creating stability for the Moroccan people in their own country is the best possible solution, and that it will stop us from having to solve numerous immigration problems in the future. However, when the Commission tells us that a new agreement will simply ratify a situation, we can plainly see, through the reports by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), that the situation to which the Commission refers is not the real solution. Furthermore, I should like to alert the Commission to another point. We are told that the negotiated – the renegotiated – agreements will enable us to support Moroccan producers. Which producers are we talking about, though? The exporters are primarily large agri-food companies that have set up huge farms in Morocco. Small Moroccan producers are not the ones who benefit from our agreements, as they do not have the capacity to produce in conditions acceptable to the European market. Let us not confuse the issue, but do not mislead the MEPs either: that is my request to the Commission. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for my group, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the conditions in which we were able to work with him on this matter. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe this is a truly strategic matter at the moment. We have already heard about China. I should like to quote a figure: in 2010, the Chinese bought 49% of the soymeal placed on the market. The forecast for 2011 is that the same customers will buy 57% of the total quantities placed on the market. Hence, it really is a matter of European independence that we are looking at in the medium term. Imagine for a moment that some very intensive farming regions found themselves without imported soya for a week: what would happen? We urgently need to redevelop these crops in our region. My country introduced a policy in the context of Article 68 back in 2010. This policy demonstrated that production could be adapted to policies.

Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I believe that we should be pleased, because we may be talking about a crisis today, but this is because our system has worked. We have the strongest consumer protection system in the world. Consumers need to bear that in mind right now. However, the system did not work properly, and before we come up with another one, I believe that we must carefully and comprehensively look at the reasons why the problem was discovered so late, and we must ask ourselves about the causes of this delay. However, I think that, apart from denouncing the criminal act itself, we must also question why it happened. I believe that, because of our actions, the agricultural and agri-food sectors are in a race towards low costs and towards the lowest prices on the supply side, and we are no longer shielded from deviations such as this type of unacceptable behaviour. So, Commissioner, do you intend to increase the penalties for such acts? My second question is about how we will provide immediate support – and I mean immediate – to the breeders concerned. This is because the margins are so weak that, if some people do not receive support very soon, or even advances on amounts owed to them, these breeders will disappear by the time the procedure reaches a conclusion at what I would call ‘normal’ speed. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, I think that the Member who asked a question actually had a comment to make on a situation rather than a question to put to me. Obviously, we know that the system has gone wrong. However, with regard to European consumers, I would like to emphasise how strict our protection system is. We cannot let the statement that nothing has been done go unchallenged, given that we have the highest standards in the world. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in the thanks and congratulations addressed to those who have managed to conclude these very difficult negotiations. We are getting ready to approve a budget tomorrow which is a big step forward for the Europe of mobility and the Europe of young people. Above all, this budget demonstrates Parliament’s determination not to abandon large-scale European investments during this crisis period. However, I would like to share with you my concern and my displeasure about the choice made today by some political groups and, in particular, the Socialists, whose representatives were in government jobs at key moments, to jeopardise ITER, the only fundamental long-term research project in the European Union in which we play a leading role. As you know, the European Union made a commitment last June to contribute an additional EUR 1.3 billion to this project, which is crucial for our security. It is therefore Europe’s credibility in the world that is going to be called into question by our vote. This attitude has meant that we have lost nearly EUR 600 million of unused money in 2010, which could have been allocated to ITER. This is ridiculous! Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

 Mr President, our fellow citizens have expectations of us, they have expectations of Europe on the issue of world governance. We must be a proactive force, we must be a decisive force. Several speakers this morning have made the point that the French Presidency of the G20 could represent an opportunity for Europe. I clearly share this view, and I believe that our Parliament ought to be regularly informed of the progress of the G20’s work by the Presidency itself. I understand that the President of the French Republic would be willing to come and address us. Mr President, I think that you should invite him to do so. Michel Dantin,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, you have a good command of the French language and you know my country well. In France, there is an expression that describes something one dreams of but which never materialises, we talk about the Arlésienne
. For farmers, simplification is undoubtedly one of the forms, one of the faces of the Arlésienne
. As you have said, the Commission has already taken action to try and simplify procedures and I would like to go into a bit more detail. To my mind, there are two aspects to this issue. Firstly, there is everything to do with the requests for aid. I think it should be recognised that there has been an effort to simplify the paperwork during these last few years and months, and we give you credit for that. Secondly, there are the restrictions relating to all the conditions, the never-ending reporting requested from farmers for everything they do: taking a trailer full of manure to a field, using a dose of fertiliser in another field, using a dose of plant protection product in a third field, and if they make a mistake, they are sanctioned. Faced with this situation, Commissioner, I believe that we certainly need to find solutions. Last week, while presenting the proposal for the future common agricultural policy, you mentioned a few integrative measures that could be implemented and that could, in fact, lead, through the outcome produced by these measures, to measures that can be controlled by opinion, by farmers as well as by the Commission, measures for which we can be sure of the scientific effect. I have in mind the example of crop rotation. These measures should enable us to simplify the obligations imposed on farmers. This represents a considerable amount of work for the future. Furthermore, today as you did last week, you mentioned what is incumbent on Member States and I think you are right. Every year, the Commission controllers visit Member States before visiting the farmers. They go there with a critical eye to find what is not right. Yet could we not change their mission slightly, Commissioner, and ask them to also list – this would be beneficial to the Member States – areas where the Member States are going too far in applying EU legislation? Going too far is to impose on farmers obligations which are pointless in relation to the regulations. By doing so, you would have improved Europe’s image among our fellow citizens.

Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has been said, for bees are indeed a symbolic species, guardians of our environment. Currently, there are many research programmes dedicated to bees, with sometimes contradictory findings. A few days ago, a scientist came to see me and explained that the numerous planes that we can see in the sky have an effect on the diffraction of sun rays, leading to exhaustion and therefore to the excessive mortality of bees, for instance. Contrary to what one of our fellow Members on the right of this Chamber just said, I believe that here we have an example of a sector where pooling our knowledge and coordinating research programmes can provide a solution to the problems faced by each of our countries. Yes, Europe can be useful. This example of bees is maybe representative of European integration. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what a funny old world the agricultural world is! A year ago, in this Chamber, we were all bemoaning the general production situation. Today, one production sector, the cereal sector, is doing better than the others – and I think we should, all the same, welcome that. However, its success is unfortunately having very serious repercussions for another sector, the livestock sector. The real issue today is the agricultural industry’s inability to pass on the costs it has to incur to consumers. Therefore, as has already been said this morning, we need to help organise producers so that they can make their presence felt in their dealings with their customers and, in particular, in their dealings with the large-scale distribution sector. However, the chain, the functioning of the markets is more pernicious. How can we explain the fact that, for years, decades, we said that South American countries were placing a strain on production and bringing prices down? How can we explain that, although prices are today increasing again in those countries, we cannot pass on that increase to our producers because, yes, there has been an increase in costs, but – and this must also be said – there has been no increase in producer prices? How can we fail to mention the cost differentials that exist between our countries? Admittedly, this is partly a question of national responsibilities. However, the dumping that goes on today between our various countries helps destabilise markets, and I believe that Europe should tackle this issue. Yes, solutions must be found. European cereal producers are aware, I think, of the situation faced by their main customers – farmers. They are prepared to enter into a contractual agreement. Are you prepared, Commissioner, to support that agreement? Michel Dantin  (PPE
),

The amendment I tabled along with Mr Dess and 77 other MEPs demands full compliance by agricultural imports with European health, social, and consumer, environmental and animal protection standards. It is, after all, extraordinary to demand that European farmers conform to the highest production standards in the world, while at the same time increasing the quantity of agricultural products that can enter Europe without meeting those same standards. Consumers must be able to benefit from a single level of protection, no matter what they buy, and farmers must be rewarded for their tremendous efforts, not subjected to de facto 
unfair competition on the part of third countries. That is my idea of a balanced food and agriculture policy, anyway. This resolution sends a clear message to the Commission and to third countries, which is why I support it. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 France is one of the countries of the Union with the highest birth rates. This is due to a set of measures contained in an all-embracing family policy. The resolution as it stands after the votes on the amendments does not bring about any real improvement. On the contrary, it will throw everything into question because the budgetary burden of the measures cannot be borne at this time. Those are the reasons that led me to withhold approval from the text, which is, incidentally, well meaning. Michel Dantin  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report entrusted to our fellow Member, Mr Bové, addresses what is, today, a crucial issue for society, from consumers to producers. The Commission’s figures speak volumes, Commissioner: 20 years ago, milk producers received 31% of the chain’s turnover, which back then equated to just over EUR 450 million. Today, they receive only 24% of the turnover, or just under EUR 550 million. Other examples exist with regard to fruit, meat and so on. Clarifying pricing is therefore today a prerequisite for reforming the common agricultural policy (CAP) because, if we do not clarify it, the CAP will, in future, seem like a bottomless pit in the eyes of the public and of farmers themselves. The CAP’s profits are today being siphoned off, but for the benefit of whom, of what? Ladies and gentlemen, it is our duty to understand what is going on. Contrary to what I am hearing from certain quarters, producers are no less well organised today than they were 20 or 30 years ago. However, the other stakeholders have grown, and the number of producers has decreased even more rapidly than that of farmers. The chain has become longer, too. This situation requires us to adapt competition law and to supplement the market crisis management tools, which no longer seem suited to the new architecture of the chains linking producers to consumers. Lastly, there is the specific issue of quality products, in particular, with regard to imported imitations. We need clarity. Commissioner, your services are examining the functioning of the French prices and margins observatory. There is room for improvement, but it already contains a wealth of information on consumer-level pricing and on the niches where margins are hidden. I should like to commend the work that has also been done by our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Köstinger. Attacks have been made here and there today. One of the merits of our Parliament is that we respect different points of view. This is also the case with regard to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Everyone remains free to vote as they wish. For my part, I shall not compromise my vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Michel Dantin,

Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Lyon, as well as the team of shadow rapporteurs, who I feel cooperated effectively with him on this report. As far as our group is concerned, this report conveys an ambition for European agriculture. It was written following the raw material crises of 2007 and 2008 and following the farming crisis of 2009, which taught us that liberalism is not the solution for agriculture. Our agriculture is firstly intended to provide – to guarantee – food security for 450 million Europeans, but we must also take our place on solvent markets. It is clear that the conditions that have prevailed since the middle of the 20th century have evolved, that techniques have evolved and must still evolve, that they must change, and that agricultural policy instruments must also evolve. Agriculture must be supported in this evolution. While the first pillar, financed solely from the EU budget, must support the level of societal demands that we attach to agriculture, the second, cofinanced pillar must continue to support the modernisation of agriculture and agri-foods so as to take the new contexts into account. This policy will also have to be fairer – yes, I did say fairer – between countries and between farmers themselves. It is clearly our wish to give hope back to the 14 million farmers and their families, in particular to ensure the replacement of the 4.5 million farmers who, today, are over 60 and who are going to leave the profession. The issue of generational change will be one of our concerns. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).  
– (FR) 
Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent work that has been done. The text has developed between the two readings, and seems to be going in the right direction. In the year since we began discussing this issue, I have noticed that the public – at least in my region – is baffled when they see how little coordination there is between rail companies today. How can we, in this House, legitimately call for more ambition with regard to the environment? Should we merely express our regret that Copenhagen was not a complete success, when we in Europe are incapable of actually shifting our freight transport to rail, either purely to rail or to multimodal transport? Some sectors of multimodal transport have developed, and it has taken time for road hauliers to adapt, but they have been able to appreciate the complementary nature of this system and demonstrate that it is effective. We cannot have a debate today if nothing comes of it afterwards; we have an obligation to act, and to act quickly. It is true that, beyond this text, there may be some problems here and there with infrastructure. I would particularly like to draw your attention, Commissioner, to the issue of cross-border sections. They are often nobody’s responsibility, yet they are the link we need to successfully complete our European project. I have also heard some parties, and more specifically the social partners, express the fear that some powers may be lost. However, I am convinced that the success of this project will provide an opportunity for us to work harder, and to work harder together. I feel this is very much an issue on which Europe can show its practical side to our fellow citizens. We certainly need this. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, as you well know, agriculture is an economic sector that comprises specific features that mean that public intervention may occasionally be necessary, if not desirable, in the interests of producers, consumers and the public. There are at least three reasons why public intervention in this economic sector is as justifiable in the European Union as it is in other countries of the world. The characteristics of supply of agricultural goods and the demand for foodstuffs make agricultural markets unstable. Agriculture also produces non-market goods and helps ensure a certain degree of social stability in our countries and our countryside through the jobs that it creates. Above all, agriculture is the basis of an abundant, varied and healthy food supply. Can we be satisfied, then, with the current economic situation of our rural areas and our farmers? A few days ago, Commissioner, a senior official gave me the following figures for his département
 – as it happens, this is a French département
 that you know well, a livestock farming department. The administrative centre holds 2 500 agricultural accounts. Of those, 800 have a debt ratio in excess of 80%, and 20% have a debt ratio of 100% or more. Faced with such figures – which, I admit, surprised even me – the issue to be dealt with today is not just one of revenue but of the decapitalisation of European agriculture. Less aid, less public intervention and more restrictions on production: that is a truly explosive combination. It is true that the general economic crisis is aggravating the situation. However, we must also question certain decisions taken by the Commission, certain decisions taken by your colleagues, Commissioner. Agriculture remains a bargaining chip in trade agreements. Despite the situation in Europe, meat, certain cereals, fruits and vegetables are all affected. The recent agreement between the European Union and the Andean countries, in particular, Peru and Colombia, will sacrifice the producers of the outermost regions. We cannot continue with such a policy. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Mrs Paulsen, thank you for your report. I would like to applaud the work that has been done by the various shadow rapporteurs as part of the preparation for this dossier and, in particular, the rapporteur for my group, Mrs Jeggle. This issue resonates differently in the various European countries. Not all producers or consumers perceive the issue in the same way. In spite of this, European legislation is gradually succeeding in creating a very strict standard, which I feel we should make much better use of in international negotiations and, in particular, in the control of imported products. However, as has already been said, these rules carry a cost, and every day we are seeing this cost rise for farmers and other operators, at the very time when the profitability of farming is being hit hard. This is, therefore, a clear justification for the common agricultural policy. If we spend EUR 100 per head per year to finance a common agricultural policy, animal welfare is one good reason why this funding is needed. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Mr President, I would like to thank our colleague, Mr Dorfmann, for his excellent work on this report. I think it sums up perfectly the issue as it stands today in terms of the Commission’s proposals. It is the Commissioner whom I would like to address in particular. This work has been going on for several months now. It is creating great agitation within several of our countries’ industries, which are threatened with reclassification, and this reclassification is happening or may happen at a time when – and this will be the subject of tomorrow evening’s oral question – many production sectors are experiencing particular difficulties. We therefore need to move forward and move forward quickly. I do not think we can wait three years to come up with a clear answer for the farmers who are affected by this delimitation exercise. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Scottà, I find it truly symbolic, Commissioner, that your first speech before this House should be on the very subject of quality policy. I believe that we take the same approach to these quality products. Yes, they represent an opportunity for our most fragile regions. Yes, they are a means by which to make the operators of a region and, in particular, farmers, more dynamic. Yes, they represent a strong signal sent out to European consumers, but also to consumers throughout the world, with regard to our agricultural model. Burgundy wine, Parma ham, certain Spanish meats – they have meaning far beyond the borders of each of our countries, far beyond the borders of Europe. The resolution that we shall no doubt adopt tomorrow offers you, Commissioner, a greater degree of ambition with regard to this policy of quality products, of products identified by different signs. European policy must be clearer; it must stop producers from being taken over by certain large industrial or distribution groups, which would clearly like to deprive producers of the benefit of the added value that these products give them. During the hearing, I drew your attention to the need to give organisations that bear, in particular, designations of origin overall responsibility for managing their products. Management of production rights is a fundamental part of quality production policy. Moreover, almost all of our committee voted in favour of an amendment along these lines. I should like to respond to our UK fellow Members with regard to paragraph 19 on the fruit and vegetables sector. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we must not go backwards, but neither must we allow the huge vacuum in fruit and vegetable policy that means that, today, distributors are the only ones calling the shots. Let us together interpret this amendment as a call to find a new middle way. Commissioner, you can very quickly convince us of your enthusiasm for this specific policy, which gives consumers a different image of agriculture. Now present us with a good text. Do so quickly; we have faith in you. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, thank you, once again, for your attention. The price crisis in 2007-2008 highlighted the weak position of consumers with regard to price volatility. The agricultural crisis of 2009 is having a much more detrimental effect on farms than the indices reveal. Why? Because the upward trend in agricultural prices was portrayed by many as sustainable, and because farmers without doubt invested far too much in 2008 and at the beginning of 2009 – far too much because a delay has built up since the beginning of the 2000s. On several occasions, Commissioner, you have expressed a desire to no longer intervene in market regulation in the same way. But have we failed to remember over the last 20 years that agricultural commodities are primarily food products and that we need a certain degree of price stability at both ends of the chain? Price stability is required at consumer level, on the one hand, because, due to other financial commitments such as mortgages, parenting and leisure activities, the consumer does not have enough leftover income to cope with price fluctuations. At producer level, on the other hand, price stability is required because business activity involves significant capital, which requires heavy investment. Organisation within the sectors that includes all the elements of the supply chain, as well as the new players – I am referring to the mass catering sector and processing companies for quick-frozen or even fresh-prepared products – can undoubtedly lead to the introduction of private tools for stabilising prices. Do you think it is possible to find a way forward with this, Commissioner, and is the Commission ready to participate in such discussions? Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your statement, which I believe reflects the remarkable work you have done during your mandate. Europe has chosen a food model to protect its population. Our fellow citizens are ready to pay EUR 100 per year per capita if we guarantee the quality of their food. The other day in committee, we learnt of the Food and Veterinary Office’s report. I must tell you that, as a new MEP, I was deeply concerned to see the discomfort of your staff, who obviously could not answer or did not want to answer our questions. Commissioner, should we be ashamed of having strict rules to protect our consumers? Should we be ashamed of imposing these rules on those who want to feed our consumers? Are we ashamed when, in order to sell aircraft or cars, these same countries force us to establish this or that factory or impose this or that condition on us? Our market access conditions are important conditions because they affect food and they affect the health of our residents. We have nothing to be ashamed of. Michel Dantin  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner – I would have liked to have been able to address the Presidency of the Council too – ladies and gentlemen, as you yourself acknowledged the other day, Commissioner, to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the price paid to dairy producers no longer covers the current costs of production. What that means is that our producers are in the process of decapitalising. Just now, you listed the measures you have taken in the past nine months. Those measures do exist, we will grant you that. They have not, however, produced the anticipated effects because, in our view, they are not extensive enough, and there is definitely too much uncertainty about how effective their target is. This morning you mentioned a recovery in the market, but the producers will certainly only see the effects of this in the payments made at the beginning of next year. The agricultural products market is not the same as the market in metals or the energy market. It calls for regulatory tools, because the cycles of the seasons and nature also have an effect on market conditions. Your interpretation of the health check, carried out under the French Presidency, surprises us, since the interim assessments that it produced in relation to the dairy sector leave all avenues open, including the possibility of new decisions on tools for regulating the markets. The French delegation, to which I belong, is convinced that a renewed quotas system will be necessary after 2013. The tension that existed on the food products market prior to the current economic crisis has demonstrated the fragility of the balance across the world between production and consumption. After having partially dismantled the intervention tools, we have neither the right nor the legitimacy to dismantle today the production tools that we will need in the short term. Commissioner, we must give farmers back their dignity: these are men and women who are not afraid of hard work. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 Madam President, Mr Diamandouros, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us give the People’s Europe a face. It is the responsibility of all the European institutions to do everything in their power so that citizens are informed of all their means of redress if there are violations of Community law or bad administration by European institutions. First of all, I would like to praise the work of my colleague, Mrs Nedelcheva, for her report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2009. The European Commission has been the object of most of the Ombudsman’s criticism, often for a lack of information. The report by my fellow Member, Mrs Paliadeli, whom I would also like to congratulate, is a glaring example. Next, I would like to thank our European Ombudsman for all the work that has been accomplished, together with his whole team, and for his accessibility and his excellent collaboration with the Committee on Petitions. This is very important. His role represents an important safeguard of respect for the principle of transparency and good administration, and it is there that we will obtain genuine protection for our fellow citizens. Finally, it is time that our fellow citizens were better informed of the means of redress available to them with regard to the European Commission: namely, the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions. In order to do that, we need an Internet portal, certainly, but we need a common one, as we have already requested from you. This would provide real help to our citizens. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

The OECD study shows that there will be very substantial costs for the social budgets of Member States. For France, the annual amount is EUR 1.3 billion, and for the United Kingdom GBP 2.4 billion. In the current economic situation, increases in these budgets cannot be absorbed. What is more, businesses would have to bear these additional costs, which is impossible. However, supporting women during maternity is essential. Applying these measures poses a very great risk to the employment of women. The OECD study also shows that extending maternity leave would result in a decrease in female employment. In wishing to help women, there is a risk of penalising them in the job market. I wish to help women in their employment and to support them during maternity. The increase from 14 to 18 weeks proposed by the Commission was a real step forward. Another advance would have been to have progressive measures concerning childcare methods. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Firstly, the fact that combating poverty has been taken into account in the 2020 strategy is, for me, a significant advance. The economic crisis has intensified the problem of poverty in recent years. The European Union must be able to encourage Member States to face up to this problem. Secondly, the European Social Fund (ESF) is an essential European tool in combating poverty. I am the rapporteur for the European Social Fund and I support its use in order to get back to work the people who are furthest away from the labour market. This has been the ESF’s role since it was set up under the Treaty of Rome, and it must keep employment as its prime objective. Thirdly, I am against a minimum income without contributing in return, except for people who are unfit for work. Employment is the benchmark in reducing poverty. It is the only way of giving back dignity to everyone. Fourthly, the governments of Member States have a responsibility to combat poverty actively. Europe is there to support them and to complement what they do but not to take their place. Europe cannot cure all ills. Above all, Member States must face up to their responsibilities. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need European legislation that will protect the health of pregnant women and women who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding, and we must rise to the demographic challenge we are facing and encourage an increase in birth rates in Europe. However, this advance must not serve as a disincentive to employ women. I would emphasise three points. Firstly, I welcome the European Commission’s proposal on the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. Indeed, I would emphasise the title, which is the legal framework of this directive, because too often, we tend to forget what exactly this text is about. We are talking here about women because, until we receive proof to the contrary, men cannot give birth. The debate tends to become diluted as a result of the reference made to paternity or parental leave. Let us solve the problem faced by women first, by focusing on their health when they bring a child into the world. We must implement genuine guarantees to protect the health of these women in the labour market. Paternity and parental leave will be dealt with in another directive. Secondly, the debate revolves around the number of weeks. Currently, the average leave period is set at 14 weeks. The European Commission is proposing 18 weeks and the report 20. Obviously, as a woman and mother of three children, I want mothers to be able to stay with their babies for as long as possible. However, this then begs the question: who is going to pay for this extension from 14 to 20 weeks? The state? Businesses? I am convinced that the average increase from 14 to 18 weeks is a major European advance and a real investment by our economy towards promoting a rise in birth rates in Europe. Twenty weeks is liable to have a negative impact on female employment: it would put a brake on their employment. Businesses and our States cannot support this additional huge financial burden at this time of crisis. Thirdly, more priority must be given to improving childcare so that mothers can achieve a work-life balance. Little progress has been made on this matter despite the many appeals by our Parliament. Therefore, let us not be counterproductive and let us not send women back home. Pascale Gruny  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a pivotal moment in the debate on the future of the European Social Fund (ESF). At a time when employment has become the number one preoccupation of all countries and all European regions, I am proud of the resolution Parliament has proposed today on the future of the ESF. This text is responsible, concrete and opens doors to the future. Now more than ever, our territories need a cohesion policy and thus, support from the European structural funds. The ESF has been in place since 1957 and was established by the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, the Treaty of Rome. Its legitimacy is not in doubt. My position on the future of the ESF is simple and clear and can be summarised in three points. First, a European Social Fund must remain focused on employment, combating poverty, of course, but by getting people into work and not by other means. Today, employment must have our full attention and must be our priority. I am convinced that a person who returns to employment is also a person who regains his human dignity. Second, an effective European Social Fund must have clear, pragmatic rules that do not discourage operators. That is why I support my political group, which is calling for greater visibility for the ESF, particularly to improve its uptake. Just imagine, budget allocations are sometimes returned unused to the European Union, while unemployment rates have never been so high. Third, and finally, we need a fund that is included in the broader framework of a strong European cohesion policy. Decisions must be taken on the ESF with partners that are as close to the ground as possible. Commissioners, can you assure us that the ESF will meet these expectations? Pascale Gruny,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, we need long-term legislation to improve employment in Europe and reduce poverty. We need to address the problem of unemployment with a view to sustainable growth. I should like to make three points. First of all, the Council proposes that the guidelines for employment policies in the Member States be established every 10 years. I agree, because we need a long-term perspective, but then we also need real milestones every three years to ensure that we do not lose sight of developments on the labour market. Secondly, I tabled an amendment, which was not adopted, in which I proposed that an employment observatory be established to conduct a specific analysis of future jobs. Many young people leave school or university without any training that meets the needs of the labour market. We need to anticipate future jobs. Our young people should be able to move forward and specialise by completing training which will ensure that they keep up with the employment market. Finally, the fight against unemployment not only entails doing everything to improve the employment situation in Europe, but also in combating poverty. The professional integration of people who have been out of work for a long time is vital in the fight against poverty. The European Social Fund is the instrument which can help bring these people back to the labour market. Let us start by giving these people their dignity back, by giving them jobs, and let us avoid helping them with no prospect of social integration. I would stress this point. Pascale Gruny,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Iturgaiz Angulo on his work. I agree with the content of the report, and do not wish to return to that particular subject. However, I would like to stress two important issues raised by Mr Iturgaiz Angulo. First of all, it is important to inform the citizens of the difference between the citizens’ initiative, the process of submitting a petition to the European Parliament, and the role of the European Ombudsman. There is still too much confusion regarding the role of each instrument. Secondly, when I go to meet citizens in my constituency, I realise that they have never heard of the right to submit a petition to the European Parliament. How can we ensure that the citizens have a clearer picture and that they are able to mobilise existing resources to their advantage? In view of this, it is vitally important for the European Parliament to possess better communication tools. Are you aware that no website currently exists to clearly explain how to submit a petition? By the same token, there is no information available to people submitting petitions which would allow them to follow, in real time, the progress of their petitions to Parliament. There is no good reason for this lack of transparency. A greater level of visibility is needed so that the citizens become aware of the fact that we are there to support them. Our committee exists and works for their benefit, and we are there to listen to them. The European Parliament must do everything within its power to close this communication gap and to highlight the work that has been carried out. This work is not of a legislative nature, that is true, but it is no less important. The citizens should be our main concern, and our committee works towards this objective each and every day. Pascale Gruny,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is only one lesson to be learned here, namely, that full-time contracts of an indefinite duration must remain the norm. First of all, I would like to thank all the colleagues who contributed to the drawing up of this report. Today, I am disappointed that a debate has not been held on a matter which lies at the heart of the 2020 strategy. A number of my colleagues wished to speak on the subject, but were not given the opportunity to do so. Nevertheless, I would strongly encourage them to submit their contributions, in written form, to Parliament’s services. I am also disappointed that, having worked closely with all the political groups to achieve an agreement after numerous consultations, an alternative resolution, which is almost identical to my report, has been tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. My group cannot support the two elements which Mrs Schroedter has added to the alternative resolution, and which the Committee had rejected in a vote. First of all, with regard to the basis of these proposals, which concern, above all, ‘false’ self-employed persons: it is true that these are a real, widespread problem. As the report mentions, we would like a better definition of self-employed persons, but we must also ensure that the criterion pertaining to non self-employed persons is clearly defined, rather than relying on the presumption of employee status. The definition proposed by the Greens is much more vague and does not provide any added value to the text adopted by the Committee. Secondly, with regard to the call for a directive to guarantee the same rights to all workers, including the right to freedom of association, irrespective of their professional status; I do not quite understand exactly to what rights this refers, or who is preventing employees or self-employed persons from joining or forming a union. In my opinion, it is pointless to call for such a directive, and the matter falls outside of the European institutions’ sphere of competence. In my report, I wanted to make full-time contracts of an indefinite duration the norm and condemn the exploitative replacement of regular jobs with atypical contracts. I would like to remind you that the principle of flexicurity implies not only flexibility, in order to adapt to the demands of the labour market but, above all, it also refers to job security, and the one principle cannot be implemented at the expense of the other. The European Union must intensify its efforts to invest in skills and training in order to support sustainable employment. The unemployment rate remains far too high in the European Union, and atypical contracts therefore do have a role to play on the labour market. With regard to young people, atypical contracts could, for example, provide them with their first experience of the labour market. If atypical contracts could provide young people with an opportunity, and make it easier for them to become salaried employees with contracts of an indefinite duration, then I would support these kinds of contracts. With regard to people who face a long period of unemployment, once again, if an atypical contract facilitates their transition back onto the labour market, then I am in favour of this kind of contract. Finally, if an atypical contract is used in the context of moving from one job to another or from one professional status to another, then, once again, I would support this kind of contract, as the main aim is to keep people in employment. I would also stress the vital role played by the social partners and civil society organisations in the drawing up and implementation of employment policies. I call on all the Member States to ensure their full participation, as all too often, their level of involvement varies from one Member State to another. Finally, we must ensure that they enjoy an improved level of recognition, at both social and institutional level. In this report, the European Parliament is sending out a strong signal to the governments of the Member States and to the Commission. Secure career paths are an essential aspect of a social Europe. The ball is now in the European Council’s court. I hope that the Council will stand by its resolutions in the field of employment, adopted in the spring of 2010. The European Union needs a clear focus and specific measures to protect employment in our regions and to create new opportunities, within the framework of the 2020 strategy. Pascale Gruny  (PPE
),

 The directive that we are debating today is the fruit of very lengthy negotiations in the European Parliament over two mandates. This is a very sensitive issue, as it concerns our jobs both today and in the future. It is a matter of road safety and of fair competition between companies in the Member States. I would not accept social dumping within our Union itself. Could an independent driver work 14 hours a day, 84 hours a week, and not be a risk on the roads? Compared with a company-employed driver, this is unfair competition. This also leads some companies to suggest to their employees that they declare themselves self-employed. We must protect our fellow citizens and our companies. I therefore invite the European Commission to withdraw its proposal and, failing that, I call on MEPs, during tomorrow’s vote in plenary, to vote in favour of keeping self-employed workers within the scope of working time legislation. Pascale Gruny  (PPE
).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the European Parliament is sending out a strong message to women who assist their spouses in their self-employed work. From now on, their social rights will be considerably enhanced, and I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, on the work she has done. Europe must protect. Under the new definition of ‘assisting spouse’, spouses and partners will be eligible for social protection in the event of sickness or retirement. Bakers’ spouses will now be able to benefit from social rights. It is regrettable, however, that the Council did not agree to compulsory membership, but simply adopted the system of voluntary membership. Maternity leave is also provided for all women. The new text provides for a minimum period of maternity leave for self-employed women and wives of self-employed workers throughout the European Union. The duration of this leave is currently set at 14 weeks. I am the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for the directive on the health and safety at work of pregnant workers. I sincerely hope that, with the adoption of this text, the duration of maternity leave will be increased; and why not subsequently increase it for self-employed women? To conclude, Europe has proposed some creative and pragmatic solutions to help couples to reconcile professional and family life. It is now time to switch to taking action and to implement the proposals as quickly as possible. Europe’s campaign to protect women is making headway with this text. However, we MEPs must continue to eliminate the inequalities between men and women. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all in agreement today in welcoming the measures to simplify the awarding of the Structural Funds proposed in Mr Kirilov’s report. Nevertheless, as Chair of Parliament’s Work Group on the European Social Fund, I am indignant at how long the review procedure that is currently in progress has taken. The Commission’s initial proposal dates from June 2009. Even though the purpose of this review was to help Member States combat the economic and social crisis, it took the Council six months to reach an agreement. That is unacceptable. It is true that the legislative procedure has been modified along the way to give Parliament the same amount of power as the Council. However, as the elected representatives of the European Union, we cannot today justify these delays to the public. I will now make a brief digression to welcome the responsibility shown by Parliament in agreeing as far as possible on the Council’s position in order not to delay the procedure any further. However, I would like to express my disappointment once again. We need a European Union that can take swift decisions that have a real impact on the ground. Now let us turn to the future for a moment. The simplification measures proposed today to combat the economic crisis are positive, but I would like to add that they could have been even more ambitious if the measures being applied to the current programming period, 2007-2013, had not been so clumsy and complicated. Therefore, looking ahead to the negotiations for the multiannual legislative framework for 2014-2020, I call on the European Parliament to demonstrate boldness in its proposals for the simplification of the administration and application of the Structural and Cohesion Funds. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the new online problem-solving network concerning cases of misapplication of internal market law, known as SOLVIT, is a very successful system insofar as it provides redress, without formal procedures, within approximately 10 weeks. Created in 2002, this network saw its workload increase by 22% in 2008. Even though the resolution rate remains quite high at 83%, the number of cases resolved is decreasing. It would seem to be time, eight years after it was created, to think about strengthening this institution by giving it the means to function effectively. These new measures would make it possible to help European citizens and businesses to assert their rights, especially with regard to the recognition of qualifications and of their social and residence entitlements. I therefore support the idea that not only should there be more SOLVIT staff in the Member States, but also that support and training measures should be put in place so that staff can function as efficiently as possible. It seems essential to me that governments and we ourselves, as elected representatives for our respective constituencies, should promote the SOLVIT network, which enabled cost savings of EUR 32.6 million in 2008. Furthermore, promoting this new tool would limit excessive recourse to the judicial system. I therefore call on the Member States to transpose all the European directives and make citizens and businesses aware of their rights within the internal market through national forms of media and information campaigns. To conclude, on behalf of my political group within the Committee on Petitions, I hope that cooperation between SOLVIT and our parliamentary committee will be strengthened so as to facilitate the work of these two bodies.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done, and our fellow Members for their hard work in creating this new microfinance instrument. This European instrument will make it possible to grant micro-credits to small enterprises and to people who have lost their jobs and want to set up their own small businesses. In this time of financial crisis, the most vulnerable people, especially the unemployed and young people, have been the worst affected. In fact, over 3.5 million job losses have been recorded this year in the European Union. The adoption of this new tool will make it easier for these people to access the capital required to set up or develop a business and make their dreams of entrepreneurship come true. We should not forget that over a third of micro-enterprises are created by unemployed people. In my region, I am often approached by citizens wishing to obtain aid to set up their own business. I am convinced that this new initiative will bear fruit in preserving jobs and that it will create new jobs too. The proposal will facilitate investments of low sums and will give micro-enterprises an opportunity to grow. Madam President, I would like to welcome the real added value of micro-credits, which will go hand in hand with new support measures, such as training and mentoring, which will enable the youngest people and the unemployed to obtain guarantees and assistance for their investment plans. I hope that this new instrument to promote employment will be adopted as soon as possible and that an agreement will be reached between Parliament and the Council on making this tool, which is vital for our fellow citizens, and particularly so during this crisis period, a permanent one. Ladies and gentlemen, let us not forget that it is small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every day in Europe, one in five women is a victim of violence. Violence against women is unacceptable, irrespective of the form it takes. Yet, in Europe, many women and young girls continue to live in the shadow of aggression or exploitation. The figures are alarming. Violence against women comes in many forms and occurs everywhere: domestic violence at home, sexual abuse, sexual harassment at work, rape, including within relationships, and also as a tactic of warfare outside Europe. In Europe, domestic violence is the main cause of death and disability among women between the ages of 16 and 44. As we debate these extremely serious matters, women are being assaulted. Talking about it is not enough. It is time for action. The European Union has a duty to protect its most vulnerable citizens. Fighting violence against women is a battle for fundamental human rights, and the Daphne Programme, which supports actions aimed at combating all forms of violence, is insufficient. New measures must be considered for the development of consistent European plans. I support the initiative of organising a European Year to combat violence against women, which our institution has been calling for now for more than a decade. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will not repeat all of the key points made by my fellow Members in relation to justice and immigration, but I did wish to point out that a European judicial area can only be established by enhancing mutual confidence among Member States, since that will improve the principle of mutual recognition, the cornerstone of the Europe of justice. Considerable progress has been made over the last 15 years, but there are still many weaknesses. I am delighted that the Treaty of Lisbon was finally ratified by all of the Member States during the negotiation of this text. The European Parliament will be able to have an equal say with the Council on matters relating to justice and home affairs; democratic legitimacy will be increased for the benefit of the citizens. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, I should like to stress that far too many complaints are referred to the Committee on Petitions concerning barriers to the freedom of movement of citizens within the European Union itself. I would also mention the problems linked to the mutual recognition of qualifications and to the right to social welfare benefits, as well as discrimination problems. The recognition of same-sex marriages, on the other hand, is an area that comes under the jurisdiction of the Member States. The Union must respect this national competence. I call on the European Commission to publish its guidelines as soon as possible so as to help the Member States’ authorities effectively combat breaches of the principle of free movement. Citizens must be able to move freely and to make full use of their rights in this area without internal borders. I am delighted to see that, in the resolution, the European Union’s anti-drug strategy has a place in the creation of this European judicial area. However, I hope that the European Union will show more initiative in this regard. Why does the Union not equip itself with new weapons for combating this growing trend, which affects our children at an increasingly early age? They are the future. What are we doing to protect them? Let us finally show some sense of pragmatism in our institutions! That is what our fellow citizens expect from us. Pascale Gruny,

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), to congratulate the rapporteur most sincerely on the work she has done and on the spirit of cooperation she has shown throughout the process of drafting this report. We are giving our verdict today on the annual report on the European Ombudsman’s activities, which was presented on 21 April. Appointed by the European Parliament, the Ombudsman gives us a formal account, via this report, of all the results of his inquiries into complaints concerning cases of maladministration within our European institutions and agencies. His role, which is of the utmost importance, represents an essential guarantee that the principles of transparency and good administration will be respected and therefore constitutes a genuine form of protection for our fellow citizens in cases of injustice, discrimination, abuses of power, outstanding responses and delayed information. Indeed, in this report we note the increasing number of complaints lodged with the Ombudsman. The majority concern the European Commission, the institution that, admittedly, comprises the largest number of officials, but essentially, they are cases of an alleged lack of transparency. The fact remains that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. Coming back to the report, the Committee on Petitions approved it by a large majority on 1 October. Our Ombudsman has carried out his job of examining and processing the complaints in an active and balanced way. In particular, he has always been able to maintain good relations with and between the institutions, which has helped the institutions and agencies in question to accept an amicable solution or to settle certain disputes, with a few exceptions. Moreover, the Ombudsman serves as a resource for the institutions. He helps them to improve their performance by drawing their attention to areas for improvement, the ultimate goal being to improve the service to be provided to our fellow citizens. The report that we have adopted in committee underlines and points out the importance of the adoption of a code of good administrative behaviour by all of the European institutions and agencies, a code that was already approved by the European Parliament eight years ago. This repeated call by our committee must not remain unanswered. Europeans deserve nothing less. The right to good administration by the institutions and bodies of the European Union is a fundamental right laid down in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union included in Part II of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is no longer a fantasy but a reality. Lastly, I feel the need to point out that the Ombudsman reserves the right to scrutinise the work of the Commission and must ensure that the latter makes proper use of its discretionary power to start infringement proceedings or to propose sanctions.

),

The state of the dairy market has worsened considerably over the last 12 months: the price of milk has fallen by 30% in a year, which is the sharpest fall seen in the last 20 years. We therefore urgently need to introduce new forms of regulation at European level to ensure that the dairy sector is not just dependent on the rules of the market but can actually prove a match for them. Currently, the instability in producers’ incomes does not allow the best allocation to be made of resources that are vital for future investments in the sector. Therefore, the European Commission has a duty to facilitate contractual relations within the agri-food chain, so as to balance the relations between the various operators in the sector, stabilise the markets and prevent market risks. It must also encourage better organisation within the sectors. In addition, consideration should be given to whether an increase in milk quotas might have a positive impact on producer prices. Europe must act now. We can wait no longer. If we do not act, we will run the risk of seeing the European dairy sector suffer lasting damage, thus depriving our fragile rural areas of the hub of their economies.Arnaud Danjean,

Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to list today all of the crises and threats that affect our security and the stability of our continent and its neighbours. Every day – as we have just heard – we hear new reasons that lead us to believe that this multipolar world at the start of the 21st
 century is in many regards more dangerous than the world we had become used to because it is less predictable and less organised: civil war in Syria, Israeli-Arab tensions, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, clashes and crime in the Sahel, piracy off the coast of Somalia and continued fighting in Congo, to list just today’s dangers. In light of this situation, it would be irresponsible to think of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) as a luxury or a bit of an aside. It is a policy that is undoubtedly recent and still being formed. More than any other policy at EU level, it is a policy that is based on the Member States, on their material and human capacities, on their traditions and on their political desire to share, or not, as the case may be, their almost absolute sovereignty in diplomatic and military matters. This leads too many observers – and too many Members here – to believe that the CSDP is negligible or a pointless illusion. On the contrary, we believe – without any naivety or excess illusions – that the CSDP is a strategic necessity for the European Union. That is also why it appears in full in the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Union simply cannot continue just to systematically delegate its security and that of its neighbours. Of course, NATO, which brings together 21 of the 27 Member States, is still the cornerstone of the continent’s common defence, and we should be pleased about that. In addition, we must reaffirm the transatlantic partnership, which is irreplaceable, but it does not exclude efforts and ambitions on the part of the European countries themselves; on the contrary. Indeed, the United States, which has begun a real strategic shift towards Asia and the Pacific is calling on us in Europe to be more active, more robust, more sure of ourselves when it comes to security and defence. Those who call into question the CSDP and say that it duplicates work must realise that it offers pragmatic and intelligent complementarity when it comes to NATO, a military organisation, and the European Union. There are some crises that affect our security and in which NATO cannot intervene; Georgia was one example, and the same applies generally to the African conflicts, where the United States does not feel obliged to intervene, as we saw with the recent example of Libya. Unfortunately, these examples could increase in the future. Action by the European Union is often completely legitimate because its actions comply fully with international law, and there are few third countries that do not acknowledge its balanced role without any ambiguous, unilateral ambitions. It has many ways to act; it has the excellent civilian/military global approach and it is the only body to have this. All too often, unfortunately, what we are missing is political will – above all, on the part of the Member States: a lack of political will – and we have to emphasise this, too – or motivation on the part of certain Brussels institutions that are in charge of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the CSDP, a lack of vision at times, a reluctance to act in the Council, an ideological reluctance because we believe that soft power is more effective that the use of an armed force, and an absence of clear priorities that, too often, give the impression that we are making it up as we go along. The strategic challenges that we face are enormous and unprecedented: a structural and sustainable reduction in the defence budgets of European countries, the reorientation of US priorities, volatility and an extremely diverse range of threats. Therefore, the Member States either have to undergo a major and collective strategic downgrade, or pick themselves up and exploit as best they can, the potential of the CSDP, modest as it still may be. There is no doubt that most of our efforts today should focus on capacity-building, and in this regard we emphasise in the report the virtues of the pooling and sharing initiative promoted by the European Defence Agency, which is a step in the right direction. The economic and strategic crises must not be used as an excuse – and this is important, Mr President – to turn our backs, but should instead be an opportunity to strengthen our common ambition. (Applause) Arnaud Danjean,

Mr President, I would like to thank all of my colleagues who were involved in the preparation of this report in all of their groups. It is very pleasing to see such a broad consensus that the European Union has to equip itself with the means to achieve a global, international ambition, including a security and defence policy. Like the Minister, I am sorry that our British colleagues still have a very ideological and completely unpragmatic position, which is reflected in their actions. They have spoken here as the representatives of a great military nation, but they should not be under any illusions. That great military nation is also going to suffer, and is already suffering, a considerable strategic decline, with defence budget cuts, and problems with materials and human resources, like all European countries. Of course, NATO is our last resource, but NATO will not be able to intervene always and everywhere to defend European interests. Some Member States are not members of NATO. Some NATO countries will not always be prepared to defend European interests. We have to face up to that possibility. The European Union must therefore maintain a form of autonomy, which is not rivalry, competition or duplication, but intelligent complementarity. That is already the case across all of the European Union’s missions: more than a dozen missions are being carried out successfully today and are expected – and this is the most important aspect – by the countries that are in crisis. They recognise the European Union’s legitimacy and, undoubtedly, they would not be prepared to do that for any other international actor. We must be proud of that and we must restate this ambition. I hope that the relatively strong vote tomorrow in favour of this report will help the High Representative and the Council to forge ahead. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, the free and exemplary elections that took place in Georgia, which we had the privilege of observing with some of our colleagues, have resulted in democratic change in that country, which is a great privilege in the region.  The irony, of course, is that those who won the election, and we must congratulate them, are also those who during the campaign complained about a dictatorship run by criminals. We can only hope now that these new leaders will be somewhat wiser and reasonable in government than they were at times during the campaign. The European Union – as you did so successfully during your first trip to Tbilisi, it has to be said – must, without any paranoia or naivety, pay close attention to what happens in Georgia and judge the new authorities on their actions and their results, not just their declared intentions. It must also remain vigilant and remind those authorities that a change is not the same as revenge. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we are all aware of the extent of your task and the difficulties involved in coordinating the Member States, which are highly sensitive about their diplomatic and military prerogatives. That requires us to be somewhat lenient and to recognise willingly that you do not spare any efforts. Nevertheless, it is impossible for us today not to express a degree of disappointment or even frustration, and this is clearly expressed in the Brok report, which underlines the lack of any clear sense of strategic priorities for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). Your commendable objective is the implementation of the comprehensive approach, which should give the European Union added value on the international stage. However, I must admit that the approach seems, above all, to be global in its dimension and, I was going to say, in its geographical scope. If we want to be everywhere, all the time, one sometimes wonders what the European Union actually does and where it really exercises successful global capabilities. You rightly mentioned the Horn of Africa; it is true that the EU is putting all of its resources, including its military resources, to work there, and it is still a success, but a limited success. The CFSP really has to get away from the fragmented, divided initiatives that take shape in response to emergencies and new situations and which concentrate on a hierarchy of priorities and truly coherent mobilisation of all of its instruments.

Mr President, I must say I am quite surprised to see Georgia being discussed today. Sure, as has been pointed out, there are visits by eminent public figures. Sure, there are elections to be held in October. However, this is not the only country where there are important visits and elections. We all know why we are talking about Georgia today. We are talking about Georgia today because a certain oligarch has decided to take part in the elections – which is his right - and because he has flooded the coffers of lobbyists in Washington and Brussels with dollars and euros, which has obviously paid off as we have placed Georgia on our agenda, not to talk about the Russian occupation, or about Russia’s violation of cease-fire agreements or about Russian military manoeuvres during October, in the midst of elections, but about the electoral process in Georgia. You have pointed out a number of resolutions in which we voted for an independent civil society, for a strong and credible opposition. An oligarch’s millions of dollars do not make a strong and credible opposition, nor do they create an independent civil society. Of course, we should not be giving a blank cheque to Mr Saakashvili. Yet I think that giving a blank cheque to this oligarch who has gone into politics is much more dangerous. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the resolution on the upcoming presidential elections in Russia, to be held on 4 March 2012, and on the controversial outcome of the legislative elections of 4 December 2011. With this text, we wanted to condemn the lack of transparency and impartiality of the Russian electoral system, prone to multiple cases of fraud, the lack of neutrality of the media, and the convergence of the state and the governing party. The aim of this resolution is therefore to express the EU’s concerns with regard to the situation of human rights and the rule of law in Russia. We urge Russia to hold free and democratic elections, and to punish those responsible for all forms of fraud and intimidation. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 I supported and participated in the drafting of this resolution in order to respond quickly to an unprecedented deterioration of the situation in Syria. I therefore voted in favour of this text, which calls for the regime to end the atrocities committed, to support the initiatives undertaken by the Arab League to end the crisis, and to strongly condemn the support shown by Russia and China for the Syrian regime.

 I voted in favour of maintaining the funds of the European Programme of food aid for the most deprived (PEAD) for two additional years (2012 and 2013). Indeed, it is our responsibility to ensure the survival of such a programme, which has helped more than 18 million deprived people in 19 Member States of the European Union since 1987 (under the CAP). This programme will therefore continue to supply food to numerous charities working to eradicate hunger, with an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million. At present, our new fight, in which I wish to be fully engaged, is to ensure the long-term sustainability of this important solidarity programme by guaranteeing its funding beyond 2013.

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation on contractual relations in the milk sector. In effect, the report is, largely, a response to the terrible crisis that afflicted the milk sector in 2008-2010, when prices paid to producers collapsed dramatically. Furthermore, it looks to prepare dairy producers for the expiry of dairy quotas in 2015. In this way, it aims to increase the bargaining power of dairy producers in order to ensure that they receive fairer prices for their products, without encroaching on the right to competition. In order to do this, the new regulation permits, amongst others things, dairy producers to be able to join producer organisations so that they can gain real clout against processors as well as ensuring fairer distribution of added value along the supply chain. In the long term, this approach aims to provide a fairer standard of living for dairy producers. Today, therefore, I urge dairy producers to fully embrace the new tools established by European legislation, so that they may help further their interests, find their place in the market and prepare themselves for the ‘post-quota era’.

 Mr President, the situation in Syria is currently the most serious and painful challenge facing the international community. Bombarding your own people with heavy artillery, imprisoning and torturing civilians, including children: these are things that we cannot tolerate and which bear witness to the blindness of a criminal regime. It is easy to become indignant and to condemn; it is harder to act, and to act effectively. Once we exclude – properly I believe – the possibility of military intervention as in Libya, we should recognise that our scope for action is very limited. There are, however, ways to contribute to the further isolation of this regime, an isolation that is, as Mr Brok emphasised, without doubt, the most realistic way forward. First of all, sanctions, on which the EU has taken the lead. These must be reinforced as much as possible, and they are a useful course of action. In the key area of diplomacy, we must first condemn the unchallengeable Russian and Chinese vetoes and we must, above all, make these countries realise that such vetoes are not only unacceptable, they are also incomprehensible and are a dead end for those countries themselves. The Arab League is taking initiatives; it is playing a major role which is to be welcomed and which ought to be supported and strengthened, even if all of the options that it presents are unrealisable in the short term. These initiatives have the immense merit of being in existence and of being widely adopted by responsible countries. Beyond the political need to apply maximum pressure on the Syrian regime and those who support it, like Iran and Russia, there is also a humanitarian emergency. The demand for unconditional, immediate access to the victims has no need of a UN resolution; it is an absolute moral duty. The EU and its Member States must bring all of their weight to bear to push forward the Arab League‘s initiatives and bring an end to the scandal of this repression from another age. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
).

 Mr President, the excellent report by our colleague, Mr Lisek, highlights the main constraint affecting national and multilateral defence efforts, now and in the future, namely, budgetary restraint. European countries will also be affected by another strategic constraint: the attitude of our US friends and allies, who are no longer willing or able to do everything for us where security is concerned. The Libyan case illustrated this point well. Therefore, in this very restrictive context, we must revive the ambition for a common security and defence policy which is strong on operations and capabilities. In terms of operations, Baroness Ashton, you talk at length – and rightly so – about this famous comprehensive approach that undoubtedly only the European Union has the power to promote in terms of the main international crises. We still need to ensure – and this is your role – that this comprehensive approach does not sacrifice security elements and, where appropriate, military elements. It must be truly comprehensive, without watering down this security aspect. That is the positive message you have given us through the Sahel and Horn of Africa strategies, and I welcome it. In terms of capabilities, we must, of course, welcome the European Defence Agency’s role, even if there are unfortunately still some restrictions on its budget. I would be grateful if you could make your assessment of the European Defence Agency’s efforts known. When talking about the defence industry, we must also remember that strengthening and supporting our European defence industries – obviously without forgetting to rationalise them – also supports jobs and technologies that extend far beyond the defence sector alone and which are of huge strategic importance to our economies, particularly during times of crisis. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Madam President, I hope that the resolution on Libya that we will be voting on tomorrow, and on which there is broad agreement, will be just as relevant as the resolution that we approved here six months ago, where the bulk of the provisions have proved perfectly reasonable. The condemnation and sanctions aimed at the Gaddafi regime, the introduction of the principle of the duty to protect civilian populations, if necessary through recourse to military force, and the recognition of the legitimacy of the National Transitional Council: all of these provisions were approved here before they were ever discussed in the European Council or implemented by the Member States. They form the backbone of the action taken by the international community. We should honour all those countries, particularly the European countries, of which there are many, that have been steadfastly committed to supporting the Libyan people’s desire for freedom through both diplomatic and military means. I feel that it is also important to pay tribute to the French pilots who, on 19 March, wiped out the columns of Colonel Gaddafi’s troops that were marching on Benghazi, thereby preventing the town from being added to the roll-call of ravaged towns mourned by Europe, such as Vukovar and Srebrenica. Six months on, obviously we need to avoid unwarranted optimism, because although Colonel Gaddafi’s reign has come to an end, the conflict itself has not, and also because the challenges associated with the embryonic transition are massive and far from resolved. The European Union therefore needs to act now by taking a leading role in this delicate phase. We need to work with other international players to offer prompt assistance and support that go beyond the humanitarian efforts that have already been made and that focus primarily on supporting civil movements, establishing institutions and organising the security sector. First and foremost, these concerted efforts must be based on one clear principle, namely that this transition must be guided by the Libyans themselves and that no one, albeit with the best intentions in the world, can take the place of the Libyan people’s hopes for independence. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, on behalf of the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to congratulate you on your presentation of this very ambitious programme. You mentioned, with good reason, the external crises and the need to ensure the security and defence of the European Union, and were right to do so. While the Libyan crisis has, unfortunately, once again reminded us of and illustrated the difficulties the European Union faces in existing as such, in the international arena, we are pleased that the Polish Presidency has the courage to take on this debate. It should be emphatically noted that the common security and defence policy is not a secondary option, but rather it is a necessity. It is, firstly, an aim which is enshrined in the Treaty and is thus binding on the Member States and European institutions. It is also a strategic necessity; every day, with all the crises and threats all around us, we are finding that our US friends and allies cannot and do not want to do everything on our behalf. Lastly, it is an economic imperative at a time of budgetary restraint. Defence has a cost which many of our citizens consider exorbitant. To maintain our defence capabilities, as well as our industries, our expertise and our jobs, we must collectively streamline our defence budgets. The Member States must accept their responsibilities, but the European Union institutions – and I am thinking here of the High Representative and the External Action Service – should function more as a source of initiatives, and we are counting on the Polish Presidency to stimulate these initiatives. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the Libyan crisis has, unfortunately, once again illustrated the European Union’s difficulties in existing diplomatically and militarily. However, it would be most unfair to blame you solely for the lack of political will displayed by the Union, even if many of us believe that more decisive action could have been and should have been taken. It is also true that the Member States bear a great deal of responsibility for this inability to come up with a coherent, effective and visible policy on this matter, while our US friends relied heavily on Europe to act. The Libyan crisis aside, however, we must be mindful of the major strategic developments that mean that we must not give up on the ambition of a common security and defence policy, as enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, and which you, Baroness Ashton, must continue to inspire, support and speak up for. Taken together, the unprecedented fiscal constraints on defence budgets, the many international crises and the United States’ strategic redeployment are significant factors that leave us no choice but to take our destiny into our own hands. Faced with these many crises and threats, we cannot just hand over the keys to our US friends and allies or to NATO. Neither the United States nor NATO was able to end the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, for example, and nor can the United States or NATO observe the current ceasefire there. It is the European mission that has full legitimacy. We can clearly see in Libya that the United States did not want to be in the front line and that NATO’s minimum undertaking is insufficient. Baroness Ashton, the common security and defence policy is not just something achieved over 10 years or just an ambition enshrined in the Treaties. It is also a strategic requirement, and you must be at the forefront taking the necessary initiatives. (Applause) Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you emphasised – and we are all aware of this – the urgent need to take action in response to the Libyan crisis. You rightly pointed out what the European Union has done and has done rather well in humanitarian terms and in terms of the evacuation of European citizens. Indeed, I think that the European Union would have gained from publicising these actions and making them much more visible, because people too often have the impression that the Member States alone carry out these operations, whereas you have pointed out that European mechanisms have worked here. On a political and military level now, a reminder of the need for a no-fly zone is certainly necessary, if not just politically, then also militarily. It will take more than that, however, because – let us not forget – no-fly zones did not prevent atrocities on the ground in Bosnia and Kosovo, even when, in the case of overflying, they were applied very rigorously. While we await the UN Security Council’s decisions, we have European common security and defence policy instruments. We can implement them for the purposes of maritime surveillance, monitoring the embargo and delivering humanitarian aid. Europe has to make its voice heard on this point, and you have the instruments with which to act. Arnaud Danjean,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the subject we are dealing with today is one that we ought to have begun looking at many months ago, given that the security situation in the Sahel region has been steadily deteriorating for over three years now. Furthermore, we are dealing with the subject in a week in which we in France have buried two innocent young victims of Islamic terrorism, who were killed on the Niger-Mali border a few weeks ago. Aside from the intense feelings that these crimes arouse, we need to recognise the real threats concentrated in this region on Europe’s doorstep, as the threat is not only from terrorism, even though the kidnappings and murders are the most dramatic manifestation of the deteriorating situation in Mauritania, Mali and Niger. Criminal networks are rife. Trafficking in drugs, arms and human beings is threatening the stability of these countries, but also that of our own continent. For make no mistake, in the same way that the majority of the victims of the terrorist acts in this region are European citizens, Europe is also the destination for this trafficking. In the face of this extremely worrying situation, the European Union should put in place an integrated, comprehensive strategy to combine its development and security policies. This is absolutely vital. There are initiatives already in place of course, via the tenth European Development Fund (EDF) in particular, and almost EUR 2 billion have been set aside for these countries for combating poverty, developing the economy and establishing more effective governance. Certain Member States have bilateral cooperation policies, too, of course. However, we now need to go much further. In particular, our action needs to be much more coordinated. We need to strengthen the regional approach and encourage these countries to work together more to deal with the common challenges they face. We also need to expand the range of policies at the EU’s disposal and integrate them as much as possible, in the areas of development, security, strengthening institutional structures, customs, the courts and the police. Baroness Ashton, there are few regions so close to Europe that harbour so many threats to our security and there are few regions in which the EU can at last put into practice the integrated approach envisaged in the Treaty of Lisbon, on the basis of which the European External Action Service which you currently head was formed. Baroness Ashton, please can you give us some details about the strategy that you intend to implement in this region? Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Madam President, to correct what has been said, Mr Arlacchi is quite right, the final text proposed to us no longer contains, in Recital B, the words ‘occupation force’. Quite simply, the translations, and particularly the French translation, were not correct in the latest version, and the French translation, until this morning, still contained the expression ‘occupation force’, hence the speech by my colleague Mr Juvin. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 – (FR)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I share your opinion on the Lisbon Summit which has come up with a new strategic concept which is satisfactory overall. However, we should nonetheless recognise, in all honesty, that the poor relation of this text is, in view of the potential of this strategic partnership, the European Union-NATO relationship, which should be a great deal more ambitious. You rightly noted the successes and progress of capability development. You noted successes, obviously, in the case of Afghanistan, where we are managing to reach compromises on the ground. However, it is unsatisfactory that we do not have a structured political dialogue with NATO, apart from the single case of Bosnia We all know that the problem is that of Turkey. We are going to have to deal with it seriously, no doubt pragmatically, and I hope that the efforts you are making with Secretary General Rasmussen will bear fruit. I briefly want to say that the problem of duplication is often advanced to highlight the weaknesses of the European Union and to limit the European Union’s aspiration to be ambitious. This is a false problem because there are not two armies in our Member States, a NATO army and a European Union army. There is an armed force in each country and it is up to the country to choose whether to place its troops under the NATO banner or the European Union banner. Let us stop scaremongering with this notion of duplication. I would like to say a word about complementarity: it is essential and must be applied intelligently. I would not want to see complementarity becoming an imperative with the European Union becoming the Red Cross of what would be a NATO armed force. The European Union must keep its military capabilities, hold onto its military ambitions and must retain its ambition in the case of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) as was pointed out in the tripartite Franco-German and Polish letter. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
).

Mr President, I will make three brief points on this subject. Firstly, as the issue at stake was France’s position regarding the sale of the Mistral, may I remind you that no firm agreement has been reached, that the Mistral is a vessel, a ship that would be sold unarmed – which is really one of the fundamental issues at the heart of talks with Russia – and that Russia has not only entered into negotiations with France to purchase this type of equipment. So, allow me to put things into perspective. I realise that there is a great deal of emotion in some countries, but emotion is one thing, the facts are quite another. Secondly, as you pointed out, Minister, we have within the European Union a code of conduct for arms exports that became a common position under the French Presidency in 2008; this code of conduct is one of the most demanding in the world. We are above exemplary on the matter, and we have, in addition to this code of conduct, as one of our fellow Members reminded us, a group that meets on a regular basis as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy to discuss not only the implementation of this code but also Member States’ national policies on arms exports. There are, therefore, forums in which the Mistral issue can be dealt with quite adequately. Lastly, allow me to say that, if we are talking about European solidarity on arms exports and if we are looking at the need to have a common strategy and a common defence policy, we need to look at the entire cycle of trade in arms and defence equipment. That also involves imports and obviously the defence industry. From that point of view, I believe that many countries also have a long way to go to ensure that Europe can maintain technologies, jobs, know-how and a real strategic capacity in our military deployments. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I should like to express the unequivocal support of the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and our unequivocal support for the very fine compromise negotiated by Mr Brok, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Gualtieri. Indeed, this is an important milestone in the creation of a common European policy in areas as sensitive as foreign affairs, security and defence. Every day, from Georgia to the coasts of Somalia, from the Balkans to Gaza, we can clearly see how much this common policy is needed and also – I was going to say above all – how much our citizens want it. Because, above and beyond the interinstitutional powers which we are welcoming today in this compromise and, in particular, the increased role given to Parliament, we must clearly emphasise the strategic opportunity represented by this External Action Service, which is an essential tool for equipping the EU with a more ambitious, more consistent, more credible and more effective common foreign and security policy. Baroness Ashton, may I say to you, as Chair of Parliament’s Subcommittee on Security and Defence and also, to some extent, as a Frenchman, that I insist on the particular responsibility which you will have to exercise, that of crisis management, by preserving and strengthening the EU’s unique character and added value, in other words, its civil-military capabilities – the two words go together. You are the one who will be responsible for ensuring that the EU maintains and increases its capabilities by rejecting the ill-founded suspicions that are voiced here and there – and indeed sometimes in this Chamber – to the effect that the service will be militarised, and by joining with Parliament as much as possible in clearly affirming the legitimacy of any operations conducted by the EU in crisis locations. Arnaud Danjean,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy that we are presenting today is an annual document by Parliament that provides a kind of interim assessment of the European Security and Defence Policy and submits proposals aimed at improving the effectiveness and visibility of that policy. This year, this report lies within a very specific context, and thus it should become a force for proposals. This specific context is characterised by the combination of three major cycles. The first concerns the 10 years of the European Security and Defence Policy, which we celebrated at the end of 2009. The last 10 years showed that Europe was able to conduct civil and military operations at the scene of more than 23 crises. That fundamental achievement can be built on further. It shows that there is a demand for Europe and that the Union has the institutional­political and operational ability to rise to these challenges. The second important cycle is, of course – and Mr Albertini mentioned it a moment ago – the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. The change in terms of security and defence goes far beyond a strict semantic adjustment. Indeed, the ESDP becomes the Common Security and Defence Policy, the CSDP, and it must take on a new dimension. The Treaty has enriched the range of tools and the scope of security and defence policy, particularly with the inclusion of assistance clauses, of solidarity clauses, with permanent structured cooperation and, above all, with the creation of the European External Action Service and of your role as High Representative, Vice-President of the Commission. Lastly, the third major event that characterises the context in which this report was drafted is that NATO which, for 21 of the 27 members of the Union, is still the main reference point where the collective security of the European continent is concerned, is currently revising its strategic concept and that this assessment by NATO should also lead us, the Union, to define more clearly the conditions of this partnership, which remains fundamental. In this context, the report’s objective is less about persisting with a doctrine than about providing you with a necessarily evolving roadmap, for all the new institutions that are being established and that must learn to work together. The aim is to make the Union more credible, more effective and more visible in security and defence terms. In this regard, the European Parliament absolutely must be given a greater degree of responsibility in these sensitive areas if a policy of which the main aim is to guarantee the security of European citizens is to be fully legitimate. With this report, we wanted to stress the following points. Firstly, we wanted to point out that, above all, the European Security and Defence Strategy and the Common Security and Defence Policy are there to serve the people of Europe, to guarantee and improve their security. This political ambition is not superfluous; it is not for appearances’ sake. It corresponds to a need for our continent to strive to ensure its own security but also to contribute to the stability of the world around us, to tackle the crises and the threats that are developing in our environment. Beyond the traditional armed conflicts that continue to take place in our immediate environment, Europe must be able to express its interests and defend them in the face of the new threats – I am thinking in particular of piracy and cybercrime. We also felt it important to stress just how unequalled Europe’s added value in crisis management is, thanks to the variety of solutions it provides and the balance that it strikes in each of its operations between the civil and military dimensions. Moreover, in this regard, I reject the criticisms that some may direct at the Union’s security and defence policy, namely to suggest that it is all about militarisation. I sincerely believe in the complementary nature of the civil and military instruments that the Union possesses, and the recent crisis in Haiti, where you went – and I believe that you were able to observe this good cooperation – testifies to the need to link our civil and military resources so that we can cope with natural disasters and major crises. Precisely on the subject of these operations, we were anxious to review them all, to highlight what we feel are their strengths, but also, at times, their weaknesses – they have to be acknowledged so that things can improve. We were also anxious to highlight several regions of strategic importance for the security of the Union and to encourage the Council and the Commission to speed up the implementation of global strategies, in particular, for the Horn of Africa and for the Afghanistan­Pakistan region. In the area of capabilities – both civil and military – which is a crucial issue in terms of the credibility of our policy, the challenge is to improve the Union’s responsiveness. We have to be able to mobilise more quickly and more effectively the material resources and the competent personnel that the Member States have at their disposal. However, we also have to have the capability, by means of a security and defence industry that is efficient, that combines invaluable technological knowledge and that also accounts for hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe, to provide ourselves with equipment programmes corresponding to these forecasted needs. The Europe of industry and defence has begun to organise itself on our continent through the defence package. Issues relating to industrial and trade cooperation with third countries should be addressed quickly, particularly in the light of the recent problems encountered by European industries trying to access the US market, for example. This is a brief, inevitably overly brief, summary of the priorities that appear in this report and which represent all the challenges that you will have to take up. Parliament is ready to play its full role, its full positive and constructive role, to help you realise this ambition, which is a common ambition. Moreover, I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank all the political groups that have worked hard to enrich this report. We have all cooperated very well together to maintain a high level of ambition, while taking account, of course, of the characteristics of each of our groups. I would also take advantage of this opportunity, Baroness Ashton, to address with you today the issue of non­proliferation. On the eve of the Non­Proliferation Treaty review conference, to be held in May, the European Parliament wished to review with you the Union’s commitment in relation to the fight against proliferation, and to the control of arms and disarmament; this is the meaning behind the oral questions that have been put to you and which you will answer shortly. The international context seems to offer new opportunities on the eve of this review conference. Firstly, President Obama has strongly affirmed his ambition to have a world without nuclear weapons and his commitment to actively seek the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear­Test­Ban Treaty by the United States. Secondly, the conclusion with Russia of a new agreement designed to supersede the START Agreement seems to be going well and, lastly, we have the launch of the negotiations on a new disarmament treaty that would prohibit the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. With regard to the reduction in nuclear arsenals, the priority is obviously to reduce the two main arsenals, that is, those of Russia and the United States, which it is commonly believed still alone hold nearly 95% of all the nuclear weapons that exist on the planet. We therefore welcome the commitment made by Presidents Medvedev and Obama to conclude a new reduction agreement in the near future. How does the Union, in this context, envisage supporting these efforts and cooperating with the United States and Russia? The Union must also rise to the challenges posed to the non­proliferation regime and, more specifically, to those with which we are confronted by the two major proliferation crises that are Iran and North Korea, which remain the main threats to international security. Will the Union continue to commit itself effectively, completely, to resolving these crises, particularly in the case of Iran? We expect your guidance on this major issue, Baroness Ashton. Moreover, the Union has a role to play in promoting cooperation relating to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. You know that this is an important challenge. What actions are being carried out in this context, and what is your strategy on the matter? Lastly, the European Parliament wants the Union to be a proactive force during the forthcoming Non­Proliferation Treaty review conference. The adoption of a new ambitious and balanced common position by the Union is crucial if the latter is to defend its position. Where do the Member States stand in this regard? Arnaud Danjean,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all the speeches which, once again, have helped to enrich the debate, to enrich this report. I would like to reassure those who have voiced their doubts and, at times, their suspicions, about the fact that this report might open the door to more competition, with NATO in particular, and even to isolation. This is by no means the case; I absolutely do not believe that, and I would add that this does not appear in the treaty, quite the opposite. You can believe a French MEP who has fought tirelessly to have his country reinstated within the integrated structures of NATO. When we talk about strategic autonomy, what idea are we developing, what policy have we been developing, for 10 years? The answer is the ability of the European Union to intervene via civil and military missions in areas in which other organisations, including NATO, cannot. NATO could not have intervened to put a stop to the conflict in Georgia, where there is no UN or OSCE presence. NATO intervened no earlier than we did in the Horn of Africa to put a stop to events threatening our security interests. Strategic autonomy also means the ability to intervene with a range of instruments that we alone possess: civil and military instruments, legal instruments, financial instruments, development instruments. The European Union is best placed to develop this global approach in crisis areas. Our strategic autonomy also refers to our ability, where necessary, not to intervene, either in unilateral military campaigns, or – and this has been pointed out by several Austrian Members – because there are neutral countries among us and because we respect their status. This is what is meant by European defence and security. This is what is meant by the strategic autonomy that we are developing by means of this policy. Never forget the origins of this European Security and Defence Policy. It originates in a tragic, bloody failure: that of the Balkans in the 1990s, where the European Union was incapable of coping with a major security challenge on its own continent. Let us not forget that. Our European citizens have not forgotten it, and they would not forgive us if we abandoned the ambition to see Europe play a role on the international stage. (Applause) Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Mr President, Mrs Ashton, the events on Ashura Day and the bloody repression of the recent demonstrations in Iran have shown that it was a total mistake to make a very artificial distinction between the hardening of the regime internally and the inflexible policy that it pursues externally, in particular, on the Iranian nuclear issue. Consequently, the prospect of additional sanctions seems inevitable, or even desirable. I would like to know your point of view on the timetable and the nature of possible sanctions precisely so that we can make a clear link between the internal events in Iran and the nuclear issue. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Mrs Ashton, you were right to stress that the important thing in Yemen in terms of security priority is to end the internal conflicts that exist in that country. We must not confuse the causes and the consequences, and without playing down the terrorist risk, the main reason for the instability in Yemen is not terrorism. Terrorism develops because there is instability due to internal conflicts. From this point of view, the priority of the European Union should be to encourage and to support the efforts currently being made to start a national dialogue in Yemen with President Saleh. At regional level, there are – as we have just been reminded – links with the Somalian crisis and the crisis in the Horn of Africa. There are very sizeable migratory flows, but also arms trafficking and movement of jihadist fighters between Yemen and Somalia. In this respect, I would like to know where the European Union stands as regards the strengthening of maritime surveillance capacities, which also concern Yemen. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Madam President, much has been said about the action plan on Afghanistan. Speaking for myself, I regret that the presentations given to us today did not place slightly more emphasis on the link between the EUPOL mission and the NATO mission in Afghanistan. This is a mission that we must carry out. The quantitative and qualitative problems that it is encountering are mainly due to the link with NATO and, in order to be effective, we must solve them as quickly as possible. I would have liked more to have been said about this. My question concerns Pakistan, the chronic instability of which is, as we all know, a factor in the crisis for the entire region and for Afghanistan, too. I see, in the action plan, that cooperation with Pakistan is envisaged in the areas of counter-terrorism and security. In that country there is, as we know, a significant ideological and sometimes structural and organisational connection between radical Islamic movements that operate in Kashmir and at the Afghan border. I wanted to be sure that the methods, the nature and the timeframe of the assistance that we envisage are gauged properly, in order to prevent this connection from having extremely adverse and harmful effects.

Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, you rightly pointed out that the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon was going to enable us to enter a new era of enlargement policy, and we have to embark on this new process with realism and a clear head: that is the essence of this resolution. On the one hand, a new process does not mean going for broke. That would be the surest way of creating misunderstandings, even suspicion, among the public, and it would also be the best way of creating false ideas among the candidate countries and of encouraging them to take refuge in rhetorical and cosmetic policies rather than in policies aimed at more thorough reforms. We must be wary of steps, conditions and values on which we cannot compromise, and I believe in particular in cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal. On the other hand, it must be reaffirmed, in the clearest of terms, that the place of the western Balkans, of all the countries of the western Balkans, including Kosovo, is indeed in the European Union, and that we must encourage them to continue and to increase their efforts. There is no contradiction between making the demands clear, on the one hand, and showing full support for the process of enlargement to include the western Balkans, on the other, just as there is no contradiction between pursuing this philosophy of judging everyone on merit and having to take important initiatives for all of the countries in the region, such as visa liberalisation. Finally, allow me to say a word about Turkey. Before speculating on any very hypothetical future outcome concerning Turkey’s accession process, I will simply say that the Commission has noted, for the second year running, that no progress was made on the Ankara Protocol and that that prevented any new negotiating chapters from being opened.

 Madam President, Commissioner, what I have to say has been said many times over by my fellow Members. At a time when Europe is considering a common strategy for its supply of raw materials and especially rare earths, we cannot overlook the huge potential that the intelligent recovery of our waste offers. Strengthening European standards so as to improve the functioning of the collection chain, solving problems relating to the leakage and illegal export of WEEE, and setting more ambitious collection targets: that is what should be at the heart of this legislation. Let us not forget who is chiefly responsible for the success or failure of this legislation: the consumer. Empowering the public is crucial if we want to implement effective legislation. To this end, Mr Florenz, the eco-contribution, among other systems, has proved to be a very important tool. Of course, electrical and electronic equipment producers must become more involved in the collection and recycling system, but we cannot absolve the citizens of all responsibility for the waste they produce. Our citizens must become actors and not spectators in European environmental policy. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Madam President, Christians are, without doubt, one of the most persecuted religious groups in the world. In the Middle East, they are seen by some extremist groups as – I quote – ‘legitimate targets’, and the end goal is their departure, pure and simple, from this region, a region which saw the birth of Christianity, and a region in which their historical presence is essential for a certain kind of balance. The events in the Baghdad cathedral are merely the culmination of a situation that we have been observing passively for far too long. The European Union, as a global player and a business partner of various countries in this region, must strongly express its indignation with regard to this situation. Discrimination, of whatever kind, cannot be tolerated. Democracy will only be victorious in this region when the most fundamental human rights, such as religious freedom, are respected.

 In adopting this resolution, the European Parliament, the voice of European citizens and democracy, is sending a clear message to the Chinese authorities: that eradicating and subjugating one culture to benefit another is an act that is not worthy of any truly great and modern country. The Tibetan people have a wholly legitimate request: that their history and language should be respected. Tibetan culture is not the only one threatened by this unreasonable decision – Cantonese and other languages will also fall victim to the policy of standardisation. Given that the Chinese Constitution specifically recognises each citizen’s right to express him/herself in his/her chosen language, how can the political authorities justify this legal U-turn? The European Union’s motto clearly sums up the message that we have a duty to pass on to the Chinese authorities through this resolution: united in diversity. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, union and realism will be on show, at least I should like that to be the case, tomorrow when we vote on our resolution for this Sixteenth Conference of the Parties on Climate Change. I therefore hope that our Commissioner in charge will be able to keep the pragmatic targets that we must meet collectively, but also to defend the absolutely non-negotiable associated conditions that Europe has set. Neither must we lose sight in these negotiations of the expectations that our fellow citizens and our industries have of a fair balance. It is the world that must fight climate change, and not Europe on its own. Therefore it will be essential to recognise the importance of intellectual property that is inadequately protected. Green technologies must be of benefit to the greatest number, but that does not mean that we must sell our current and future knowledge on the cheap, even for the sake of this vital battle against climate change. Similarly, to ask for common methods of calculating emissions as well as verification and publication of data so that all emitting industries are put on the same scale seems to be a most legitimate request and not a negotiating tactic. Finally, and my fellow Member raised this just now, more controversial are the loopholes in the current Clean Development Mechanism that are also to be put on the table. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all, regretfully, well aware that the real negotiating power does not lie with the European Parliament. However, the willingness of a number of MEPs, myself included, to work and to participate in a positive outcome of this conference must be encouraged and not neglected, as we have felt it to be in the last few days. If Europe wishes to be strong at the heart of international dialogues, so must all its lawmakers be likewise. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 The vote on Mrs Estrela’s report is vitally important. The position adopted is purely demagogic and irresponsible. By demanding 20 weeks of maternity leave, we are discrediting the European Parliament. We are the citizens’ voice; to adopt such unrealistic positions would not do justice to them. Very significant costs for the social budgets of Member States would be incurred: as regards France, for instance, the amount would be EUR 1.3 billion. The current economic situation does not allow us to absorb this kind of increase within state budgets, not to mention the consequences for our companies who will have to bear part of these additional costs. We need to support and encourage women to better reconcile maternity and work, not scupper their chances of finding a job. The increase from 14 to 18 weeks proposed by the Commission was a real step forward; a step that could have been built on by giving some thought to new childcare options. The message conveyed by this text carries huge responsibility: maternity would clearly become a barrier to personal development in the workplace. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Madam President, the scale of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is clearly such that it demands us EU political representatives to ask ourselves questions about the safety of our own oil installations. In fact, one of the keys to protecting the marine environment is to ensure that oil exploration sites are as safe as possible. Nevertheless, the idea of a moratorium on current and future oil drilling in our waters is clearly premature and inappropriate. Premature, because the outcome of the investigation into the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is not yet known, and some preliminary conclusions confirm that it was due to a combination of behavioural, organisational and technical errors. Inappropriate because − as has been said several times − different regulations apply in the North Sea, in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico. Is it worth pointing out here the serious economic and social consequences that a moratorium would have, not to mention how it might jeopardise our energy independence? Last week, Norway and Russia ended a 40-year dispute and a 30-year moratorium by confirming the principle of a common maritime border in the Barents Sea and the Arctic. This agreement will, in practice, result in the two countries sharing a hydrocarbon-rich area. How, then, could the EU executive at the same time plan to ask for these oil activities to be suspended and for them to voluntarily place themselves in a position of weakness from an energy and economic point of view?

Mr President, as our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, reminded us, biocidal products play an essential role, be it in the domestic – and hence private – sphere or in relation to public places. Biocides safeguard our hygiene and health on a daily basis. It is important that we achieve a coherent Community text. It needs to be coherent, first and foremost, with other European legislation. REACH legislation, for example, cannot and must not come into conflict with the regulation on biocides. It is important to avoid administrative and legislative red tape which strangles and suffocates our businesses. On this point, I should like to express my support for the compromise achieved by our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, on the thorny issue of exclusion criteria and candidates for substitution. Similarly, the frame formulation approach for all biocidal products is an essential element of the regulation. It will significantly increase the efficacy of the Community authorisation system. Then, it is a Community text. The introduction of the concept of centralised authorisation in the Union, and the simplification of the procedure and the reduction in the authorisation times for certain tests relating to research and development activities, are two initial positive steps towards the harmonisation of the European market in biocidal products. Finally, we must not lose sight of our ambitions for this text: protection, of course, but the construction of our Community market and European innovation must also be an integral part of our approach.

 I deeply regret the fact that Parliament has adopted the motion for a resolution tabled by the Socialists, Liberals, Greens and Communists regarding the situation of the Roma people in Europe. I feel it is unacceptable to criticise France in that way, since it is not the only Member State to return Roma to their own country. The establishment of certain Roma camps is clearly prejudicial to public order and sometimes even a violation of the right to private property, and the burden it places on our social security system entitles the French Government to take such measures in accordance with the provisions of the European Treaties. The returns to Romania and Bulgaria were carried out in accordance with French and European law and in strict compliance with human rights. I welcome the decision by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to set up a working group on Roma integration in order to find a European solution to the issue of nomadism. We need to take a constructive approach to this subject. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

I approve of the result of the vote on the text referring to the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. It may not be perfect, but the Jeggle report seems to me at least to offer a good compromise; a compromise, moreover, that has won the support of the Eurogroup for Animals. The wording allows us effectively to limit tests causing pain to animals, while avoiding a diversion of research, and hence also of innovation, outside the Union, with the resulting loss of many jobs. As Vice-President of the Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals, I am moreover convinced that it is more valuable to keep animal experimentation on our territory, where it is strictly regulated, than to leave it to third countries, where sanitary conditions and respect for animal life often leave much to be desired.

I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on this very sound text, which has been adopted by a large majority in this House. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Affairs on business registers, I should like to stress the importance of this report. The data on commerce within the European Union are crucial to the positive development and the growth of our single market, and I look forward to the Commission’s legislative proposals on this issue. Mandatory participation of all Member States in a common business register would benefit the entire Union. However, this is possible only if care is taken not to impose additional administrative burdens on our businesses and if private data are kept private, in order to maintain a climate of confidence.

 Mr President, the final agreement which has been reached on the recast of the directives on industrial emissions is more than acceptable, and I welcome the work done to reach a compromise. This final package takes up the key points of the position which I defended with several of my colleagues within the Committee on the Environment, and which was designed to make this text an ambitious, yet realistic, piece of legislation. First, a degree of flexibility is maintained for businesses and for the authorities responsible for granting exemptions. Next, I must applaud the new version of the ESN, which caused so much controversy and which seems much more achievable now that it has been restricted to certain sectors. It is also important to point out that, thanks to the agreement reached, there is a stronger link with the Emission Trading System (ETS) Directive, and the somewhat irrelevant notion of creating an SO2
 and NOx quotas market has been removed once and for all from the text of the new directive. A few reservations should, nevertheless, be borne in mind, and they relate more specifically to the provisions on soils. The Soil Directive is still pending, and unfortunately, this major issue will be addressed only by those Member States which have their own legislation. Tomorrow, Parliament has a duty to adopt the points of the agreement reached at the end of the trialogues. Huge efforts have been made by all concerned to prevent this text from being sent back to the conciliation stage. It is a text which, may I remind you, is crucially important for industry and European environmental policy alike. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 I abstained from voting on the resolution on Israel’s boarding of the Mavi Marmara flotilla. I believe the resolution put forward unbalanced claims and an erroneous version of the facts. I think we need to await the results of the inquiry commission before trying to pass judgment on the Mavi Marmara incident. We must, of course, deplore the loss of human lives but, above all, we must analyse objectively and reasonably the decisions, actions and circumstances that led to this tragedy. Undoubtedly, Israel made political and military errors, but we should nevertheless remember that a naval blockade is a legitimate measure that is recognised by international law in the context of an armed conflict at sea. The blockade, which was put in place to stop arms trafficking in that region at war, was broken through and challenged by the same fleet which is now being presented to the world as the victim of an unjustified Israeli attack. Only a rational dialogue will enable negotiations between Israel and Gaza to move forward. In the framework of that dialogue, Europe is duty-bound to provide a calm, balanced view, without showing any undue partisan fervour. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

I am very pleased with the result of the vote on the Sommer report. The European Parliament has opted for a legible and informative labelling system that will favour balanced consumption patterns. Furthermore, I welcome the adoption of Amendment 205, which will allow for the inclusion of mandatory particulars for meat and meat products derived from animals that have not been stunned prior to slaughter. The consumer needs to be informed of respect for animal welfare practices, practices that are at the heart of European food policy. This is not about stigmatising religious communities or putting their meat production and distribution chain in difficulty, but simply about letting European citizens consume with full knowledge of the facts.

This report on progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals has developed into something that I was unable to support: I considered it was important to vote against the Cashman report as a whole, following the adoption of the second point of paragraph 42 of Mr Cashman’s draft report, which was put to the vote. The lack of clarity regarding the idea behind the expression ‘safe abortion’ was impossible to ignore. Abortion, although necessary in some exceptional circumstances, must not be regarded as a method of contraception. What is more, like all medical procedures, it is never without risk.

Reducing the Israeli­Palestinian conflict to a mere comparison of the number of deaths in one or the other warring camp can only distort our view of this war, which has been going on for too long now. We all agree that it is difficult to find a solution to this conflict, since the causes themselves are complex and deep­rooted. Thus, seeing things in purely black and white terms is impossible in this area of the world. The mission led by Judge Goldstone was tasked solely with listing the violations of international law. Although not all of the conclusions in this report are unjustifiable, voting against these resolutions, which approved the approach and the conclusions of a text that I believe has been managed in a biased fashion but, above all, on the basis of incomplete objectives, struck me as being the most honest intellectual solution. Yes, we do need to denounce and stop the abuses that are committed by one or the other of the warring parties in that region, but we need to be very careful with regard to the procedure used if we want the justice to be established in the region to lead us in the direction of a lasting peace.

Mr President, today there remains less than 15% of the original bluefin tuna stock. In the face of such figures, the solution seems obvious. Nevertheless, we should not forget about the jobs affected by the decision that we are discussing today. It should be pointed out that the aim of the CITES is not to prohibit fishing but merely the international trade in this type of fish, 80% of which is exported to Japan. By protecting tuna, we are certainly protecting an endangered species, but we are also encouraging the continuation of a more balanced and sustainable fishing activity, one that is destined for our internal market and which generates employment. I am in favour of the idea of listing bluefin tuna in Appendix I of the CITES and, while I believe that this decision will be positive, the help of the Commission will be crucial, since it will mean that the fisheries sector can be completely overhauled. My question therefore concerns the conditions of this support. France is requesting an 18-month extension accompanied by financial measures for those fishermen and ship-owners affected by a trade ban. What is the Commission’s view on the subject? Moreover, I, like many of my colleagues, am concerned about fairness. How can we guarantee that boats flying the flag of countries such as Tunisia, Libya and so on will apply the international trade ban as rigorously as we do? What will the new control and penalty measures consist of? Our policy of having sustainable economic activities has to be practical, and sometimes even unpopular in certain sectors, but I hope that the Commission and the Council do not lose sight of the adjustments needed in order to implement these measures.

 Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we no longer need to demonstrate the importance of the issue of climate change. Its short, medium and long-term impacts are undeniable, although the results from the JESC have made the front page of a certain national newspaper and will undoubtedly strengthen the sceptics’ position. The Copenhagen conference appeared to the world to be a unique opportunity for world leaders to bear witness to, act on and correct the effects of this process of climate change. The European Union was a key player at this forum, not only on account of the bold legislation we have passed to limit the impact of our activities on climate, but also because Europe represents a union of countries which can really make a difference. The outcome of the Copenhagen conference has obviously left a feeling of dissatisfaction, but I refuse to call it a failure. The world, including even one of the most reluctant countries, China, has agreed on the issue of limiting the increase in temperature to two degrees. Brazil has just passed a law aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by around 39% by 2020, in line with its undertakings. Many other countries also showed great ambition with regard to greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. I am thinking here of Japan and Norway. I must also highlight the very positive point that was the consensus achieved on the urgent need for a mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation. A specific and unanimous text was produced on the implementation of the so-called REDD+ mechanism to reduce deforestation and enable CO2
 to be stored naturally. Although far from a binding agreement, but clearly along the lines of a political agreement, the outcome of Copenhagen should lead us to question why it was such a disappointment. I attended the Copenhagen conference, as did a number of my fellow Members, with this desire to participate, to help and to see a Europe of negotiation and of leadership take action. I was hugely disappointed because Europe, and particularly Parliament, clearly did not play the role that it deserved to in the negotiations. To make its presence felt, Europe must be seen to be stronger in this area. The meeting of our environment ministers in Seville went nowhere, and our leaders were seen to be unsure and hesitant, and we are still divided over our targets. I hope that Mrs Hedegaard, armed with her proposals and the undertakings she gave before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will be able to restore the ambitions of the European Union.

Freedom of the press is an absolute requirement. A democratic legislative institution like the European Parliament obviously cannot question this benefit. The protection and defence of freedom of information must be guaranteed in all circumstances. Nevertheless, the European Parliament does not have a duty to be a supranational court of justice. Pluralism and freedom of all media must be ensured in the European Union, but it does not behove us as MEPs to judge a country and its leaders on the nature of the relations between the press and the political world. Interference by the European Parliament in this area is unacceptable. What is our legitimacy for issuing any opinion whatsoever on the condition of the Italian media? This is an internal political debate of a Member State, a debate that must be held and resolved inside the frontiers of the State concerned. The rejection of the amendment which intended to change the name of this resolution to give it a more Community-orientated feel demonstrates the targeted and purely political nature of this debate. We must be careful we do not transform our assembly into a court. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Following the vote on the joint resolution on freedom of information in Italy and in the European Union as a whole, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is very satisfied.

It would not have been appropriate for this disguised personal attack to have been supported by Parliament. I am very pleased with the outcome of the vote.

Providing aid to developing countries is one duty that the European Union must not abandon. The current economic and financial crisis has given a new dimension to globalisation. The idea of a tax on financial transactions was beneficial: President Sarkozy has made it one of his priorities. Europe, it seems, has set the pace and the world has followed. The new, sound workings of international finance will have to be based on fairness. Thus, I regret that the Striffler-Ponga amendment has been rejected, as it proposed a tax on financial transactions to be added to official development assistance, so that the least developed countries could benefit from it. It is true that our economies and our financial systems would have had a greater tax burden, but the European Union would thus have been the initiator of a great international solidarity movement. We can still hope that the resolution adopted here will encourage the Union to honour its commitments and to help developing countries keep pace with globalisation. Christophe Béchu  (PPE

Mr President, I would just like to say that it may be the case that we have not organised our agenda very well today. If having free trade agreements means that we allow products to enter Europe that respect neither our social standards nor our environmental standards, the reform of the common agricultural policy will be pointless. Clearly we cannot continue to take this hypocritical approach where, on the one hand, we impose environmental restrictions relating to health and safety traceability on our farmers, on the grounds that we have to protect consumers, and, on the other hand, we allow products that fail to meet these standards to enter our continent freely. That is precisely the issue being discussed behind the scenes at the negotiations with Mercosur. Although we are being told that Parliament was very well informed and that matters have been as transparent and as clear as possible, the way in which things have been initiated does not give us a good impression of a negotiation that is being held at the same time as other negotiations are taking place at the WTO. For the sake of consistency, and of protecting consumers and our farmers, I feel that we cannot continue down this track. Christophe Béchu  (PPE

 – (FR) 
Mr President, there has to be consistency in politics. Over the last few weeks, many of us in this House have demanded measures from the Commission. When solutions are proposed to us, we will vote in favour of those solutions, even if – I agree with what has been said – they are slow in coming and even if they have had to be extracted by means of the positions adopted both within the European Parliament and among ministers. This amount, which will be useful in the very short term, does not resolve, as many have already said, the long-term issues concerning the way in which the planned end of quotas is dealt with. If we want to be in a position to cope with and to prevent repeated crises within the agricultural produce sector, there is no way that we can do so without production regulation and control tools or without a combination of the two. That is not the issue at stake this evening, however. The issue at stake this evening, the only issue that counts at the moment, is that of Article 186. Commissioner, I have one simple question: in concrete terms, what is Article 186 meant to do, and from when and in what way? Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Ms Bauer for her work, which I fully support. However, secondly, and this request is for you, Commissioner, could you tell Ms Reding that our patience is running out? Today we are in a position where the Charter of Fundamental Rights is being blatantly violated by pay inequalities which trouble no one. I was upset by hearing you say that things had got better because the gap had been reduced from 17.5% to 16.4%. I was upset because I truly believe that Europe has a crucial role to play in showing the Member States the way forward. We must of course respect the equality of citizens before the law; that is a fundamental right and we must ensure it is respected. However, over and above this, what we want is transparency, transparency so that everyone is aware of the real pay gap that exists in our society. The public sector should set an example. SMEs too clearly have a role to play, as does the private sector, but the public sector must also set an example. That is why, when Ms Bauer calls for encouragement and also for sanctions, I think we should support any future legal appeals that women bring against pay disparities. The Member States clearly need to be coerced, private business clearly needs to be coerced, but we also need to coerce the public sector, and we must adopt every possible measure, as Mr Gustafsson said just now, to ensure that women benefit from the pay equality that is achieved. We have had enough. We want growth and, for there to be growth, we need women. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

 By voting for this report, I am supporting the clarification that is needed of the measures to combat imports subject to subsidies by countries not members of the European Union. This report recommends aligning EU measures for combating ‘dumping’ with the recommendations and rulings of the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). This provision will allow us to protect our businesses better against unfair competition on the part of certain foreign companies, and that is why I voted for it. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

 The Commission’s proposal, which enhances legal certainty and improves citizens’ access to European Union legal acts, has been approved by a large majority. The electronic edition of the Official Journal (OJ) will constitute the valid publication and the official and authentic version of the OJ. The European Union must be transparent and facilitate European citizens’ access to the legislative measures that it adopts because Europe affects its citizens directly. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

 By voting in favour of this report, I wish to affirm that Europe exists to serve its citizens. Until now, roaming tariffs have been much more expensive than the price of domestic communications, for no good reason. The new EU regulation puts an end to these unfair tariffs by imposing price caps and enabling consumers to choose an operator other than their national operator for roaming services. This regulation represents a great leap forward for European citizens, who will now have more control over their mobile phone bill. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this report, which highlights the importance of greater cooperation between Member States and institutions in the implementation of common core curricula. The report actually encourages them to strengthen their exchanges so as to adapt their curricula to a growing number of students from a wide range of backgrounds. It also calls for the links between higher education institutions to be strengthened so as to allow students to gain initial work experience, on the one hand, and have a choice of teaching that better responds to the specific needs of the labour market, on the other. By voting for this report, I am therefore encouraging the modernisation of our higher education systems to better face up to competition and increase Europe’s competitiveness.

 Through my vote in favour of this report, I am stressing the importance of taking gender into account to effectively combat climate change due to gendered roles. Indeed, the discrimination suffered by women makes them more vulnerable to this phenomenon which, furthermore, amplifies inequalities. I voted in favour of this report because it also strongly encourages the adoption of a gender-based approach and greater women’s participation in drawing up development, human rights and climate change policies.

 I welcome the approval of the European Union’s accession to the Offshore Protocol. This attests to the need for increased safety and sustainable governance of oil and gas activities in the Mediterranean. The Barcelona Convention mechanism supplements the commitments made by the EU in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Union for the Mediterranean through the flagship initiative for de-pollution of the Mediterranean, ‘Horizon 2020’. In addition to the ‘sensitive areas’ investment programme for the Mediterranean, supported by the European neighbourhood and partnership instrument, other EU programmes deserve a mention: strengthening the capacities of environmental authorities, systems for sharing information on the environment, sustainable water management, cooperation on urban development and dialogue and various other research projects. It is important for the next multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 to put EU support for de-pollution of the Mediterranean on a long-term footing. The priorities must include combating pollution by plastic residues, which are poisoning marine ecosystems. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 This Parliamentary report presents a balanced and calm approach to a highly controversial subject, and I am pleased about this. I am of the opinion that the choice of energy mix and shale gas extraction permits are of national competence. This conforms to the principle of technological neutrality I defend under the Energy Roadmap 2050. This is why I do not agree with the idea of a European moratorium on shale gas exploration and extraction. Nevertheless, the European Union should draw up, on a European scale, rules that guarantee protection of the environment and high safety levels. At present, hydraulic fracturing poses serious problems that cannot be ignored. Moreover, while there is talk of abundant shale hydrocarbon resources in Europe, no one can say with certainty that the potential is sufficiently promising to envisage industrial exploitation. Therefore, to make enlightened choices, let us continue evaluating the presumed reserves and researching exploration techniques. Let us not close the door on this energy source, in view of the developments on the world energy market and the stakes with regard to competitiveness for Europe. Gaston Franco  (PPE

I voted in favour of the 2013 budget because it maintains the European programme for the most deprived persons. I would stress, however, that this programme must be maintained in the next financial framework for 2014-2020; the challenge is to focus on the long term because the associations need to be visible in order to carry out their missions in full. A year ago, many associations expressed their concern that the funding for the programme had been called into question by the Court of Justice of the European Union, putting the food supply of 18 million people in jeopardy. That situation was unacceptable and it does not reflect the idea of a protective Europe that I defend. Thanks to the mobilisation of many governments, including François Fillon’s Government at that time, an agreement was reached in the Council of the European Union to maintain the programme’s funding for two more years, namely 2012 and 2013. The beneficiaries of the programme can be reassured that the financial envelope of EUR 500 million will certainly be maintained in 2013 and I welcome that. We must continue to strive for a sustainable and satisfactory solution for all of the Member States, the beneficiaries and the contributors. Gaston Franco  (PPE

I voted in favour of this text, which is excellent news for Peugeot employees, who are currently experiencing significant social changes. This EU programme is in line with a Europe that protects citizens and that intervenes after a social disaster. In all, some EUR 12 million will be released. Presented by France in 2010, this application relates to 2 089 workers who were made redundant in the group’s subsidiaries in Ille-et-Vilaine, Franche-Comté, Alsace, Lorraine and Île-de-France.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Mr Kariņš, for this difficult report, given the sensitive nature of bilateral negotiations in the field of energy between the Member States and third countries. The agreement reached in trialogue will allow the rapid implementation of the Commission’s draft decision and, wishing to be pragmatic, we cannot but welcome it. Europe of energy is making progress, admittedly slow progress, but nevertheless progress. The European Union relies heavily on imported energy, and is in a position of structural dependence on certain supplier countries. In order for our thinking on our energy strategy to become more European, it therefore became necessary to make information on energy agreements more widely available in the Commission, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity. The establishment of an information exchange mechanism with regard to intergovernmental agreements will therefore ensure greater transparency of the energy market and, thus, allow us to anticipate problems of energy supply. I welcome the fact that this decision does not create obligations as regards agreements between commercial entities. At times of crisis and, given the issues involved in terms of competition and competitiveness, we have a duty to protect our companies’ interests and the safeguards for private contracts. Gaston Franco  (PPE

This text is realistic and ambitious. The proposed regulatory framework is an important step towards achieving the goals set within the energy and climate package, as well as promoting green growth and employment. With the addition of the European sectoral measures on energy efficiency and the provisions taken at national level by Member States, the European Union should therefore be in a position to meet its indicative target for energy efficiency, set at 20% by 2020. It is essential to fight against waste, control energy use and drive innovation, without reducing our production and economic activity. At a time when the issue of energy costs is on everyone’s mind, let us not forget that the best energy is that which we do not consume. Finally, I am particularly pleased with the provisions of the directive which aim to promote heating and cooling efficiency. However, I do regret that the final compromise does not incorporate my amendment aimed at creating a category of cogeneration units between 1 and 20 MW in remote areas that are disadvantaged and have insufficient electricity, in particular where resources are available nearby. This could have helped stimulate decentralised energy production in rural areas. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Member for the quality of his report, which I will support with pleasure. Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, our economy and our industry in Europe depend on resources and raw materials, the prices of which are become increasingly unstable and access to which is becoming uncertain in a context of fierce international competition. These include, for example, rare earths, which are necessary for many new technologies, and of which China holds almost all the mining potential. In order to protect not only our industrial competitiveness but also our environment, it is imperative that we learn how to be less dependent on these resources by developing innovation and recycling. The European Union must move towards a real circular economy, in which extending the life cycle of materials would be a priority, from the product design stage right through to the re-use and recycling of waste. With a view to efficiency, recovering energy from waste must also be promoted. We must also turn to the sustainable exploitation of resources, the potential of which is still too often underestimated. I should like to emphasise the importance of the natural capital represented by forest resources. Timber is a renewable energy source and an ideal, healthy and natural building material. Faced with the dynamism of emerging powers, we must adopt a more proactive and more imaginative attitude in the use of resources so that we can return to growth. The European Union must encourage its enterprises to create more innovative and more sustainable products. It must also exert an influence on the behaviour of consumers by empowering them. I therefore support the experiments in progress on the environmental impact labelling of products, the aim of which is to give Europeans credible information on the environmental impact of their consumption choices. Let us not forget that resources like water, for example, are fragile and precious goods. Gaston Franco,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Leinen, thank you for the work that we have carried out together. The European Union needs a manifesto, a common political vision with regard to the major environmental challenges for 2020 and beyond. That is why it is so useful to launch a 7th Environment Action Programme harmonising the existing financial frameworks and mobilising new funding resources. This programme should ensure that the EU’s environmental strategies are consistent with, and integrated into, sectoral policies, whether these relate to agriculture, fishing, research and innovation, health, transport, regional development or land management and, of course, urban policies. In spite of the economic crisis that has been giving the European Union a hard time, we must not give in to a short-term vision and abandon all ambition in terms of the environment and climate. To do nothing would be fatal. The issues are too important, particularly with regard to efficient resource use and valuing natural capital. We must therefore invest resolutely in the sustainable economy and eco-innovation, which are sources of growth, competitiveness and jobs. It is up to us to promote eco-design and recycling, but also environmental labelling of products in order to avoid waste and poor consumption choices. We cannot overlook this environmental lesson that European citizens need. The Environment Action Programme is a political programming instrument, but it is also a communication tool. It must provide the readability and predictability that is necessary not only for national and local authorities and citizens, but also for entrepreneurs and investors with regard to the European Union’s environmental choices. European regulation must not become a punishment or a vice. Gaston Franco  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that this amending budget concerning the financing of ITER was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Budgets on 29 March. By financing this cost overrun, we avoid scrapping a fundamental strategic research project in which the European Union has a leading role, and we honour our international commitments. Let us remember that none of the seven partners of the EURATOM community has questioned its overall contribution to the project. Japan, despite the drama of Fukushima, decided to honour its budgetary commitments in ITER to the full. Without this agreement, hundreds of researchers would have had to suspend their work and the ITER project would have suffered detrimental delays. Today, 1 000 people work for ITER in Cadarache. In the period from 2015 to 2017-2018, the building construction and machine assembly phase saw between 4 000 and 5 000 people deployed on this site. In conclusion, Mr President, ITER is a project Europe can take pride in and a symbol of our excellence. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 I welcome the motion for a resolution adopted by the European Parliament ahead of the forthcoming climate change conference in Durban. It is vital that we reach an international, legally binding agreement. We call on the European Union to confirm its strong commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and to show its unequivocal support for a second commitment period post-2012. The EU must formally invite all of its international partners to do the same, in order to achieve the objectives set by the Kyoto Protocol, namely reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting global warming linked to climate change to 2°C. This resolution has allowed us to turn the spotlight on a subject that is very close to my heart: improving forest management as a prerequisite for reducing deforestation. In particular, we have emphasised the need to implement the mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). Parliament has thus sent a strong message aimed at the establishment of a proper mechanism for combating deforestation, which accounts for some 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Given the extent of the European and international disasters that we have faced, such as the tsunami in 2004, Haiti in 2010 and Fukushima in 2011, it is high time that Europe had an effective system to ensure a rapid response to disasters. That is why I welcome the adoption of this report, which is the first step towards a harmonised, organised and united response from the European Union. I tabled a number of amendments, which were adopted in the final report, to emphasise the importance of prevention in crisis management and the organisation of this prevention through operational tools, which I welcome. Until more thought has been given to the establishment of any real future European civil protection force, I think that the creation of a European emergency response centre will simplify the current European Civil Protection Mechanism. I called for this European centre to be equipped with two Community tools to protect forests from forest fires, EFFIS and EFFICS, which was adopted in the final report. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 As the rapporteur for the opinion of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I would like to congratulate Carlo Fidanza on his excellent report, which is a foundation stone for a true European strategy to stimulate and complement the Member States’ action in the tourism field. Tourism is a key industry, and a source of growth and job creation. Europe needs tourism that is in phase with the modern world, the changes in world demand and the changes in our societies. We need tourism that is innovative and competitive but that also respects the environment, local cultures and local conditions. In a context of international competition between destinations, we have everything to gain from promoting our assets, our trades and our know-how, and from better communicating our unique European and national features. Therefore, the recent creation of a festival of French gastronomy celebrated on the first day of autumn is an excellent initiative that we should welcome. Sustainable tourism, cultural tourism, business and conference tourism, health tourism: these are the priorities. We should also establish Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in the tourism field in the wake of the Arab Spring. We need to make every effort together to bring prosperity to the Mediterranean on the basis of common standards and projects. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 I welcome the adoption of this own-initiative report aimed at improving the safety of offshore oil and gas platforms. Following the Gulf of Mexico disaster, I voiced my support for an improvement in safety in order to prevent a repeat of this kind of disaster, which not only endangers marine ecosystems but also severely affects the economic sectors of fishing and tourism. Parliament has voted in favour of stricter controls by independent experts and of the adoption of contingency plans prior to each operation, which I believe is an effective and proportionate response to the need to improve the safety of these platforms. Parliament has also referred to the industry’s liability in the event of a disaster, in accordance with the polluter pays principle, but without overlooking the supervisory and coordinating role that the public sector must play. I am pleased that my political group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), has insisted that no moratorium be imposed on the subject. Indeed, the introduction of a moratorium on all new deep-sea oil drilling in EU waters would be a disproportionate reaction to the need to ensure high safety standards across the EU.

 I welcome the adoption of this report, which is undoubtedly a step towards an EU energy policy promoting the successful interconnection of energy networks between Member States across national and regional borders. In order to address major challenges in the development and security of energy infrastructure in Europe, the European Parliament wished to adopt an own-initiative report in anticipation of the legislative proposal concerning a new European instrument in this field. Interconnection capacity or its availability between Member States still remains insufficient in one-third of the Union. Modernisation, cross-border interconnection and timely adaptation of energy infrastructure are essential to achieving the energy objectives for 2020, especially those concerning the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix of Member States. Market-based tools and the user-pay principle should remain the basis for financing energy infrastructure. However, the rapporteur realistically identified criteria defining projects ‘of European interest’ likely to obtain public finance, which has to result in an innovative mix of financial instruments that levers private investment. Gaston Franco  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about improving the safety of nuclear power, not about calling civil nuclear power into question when it is an essential component of energy independence and of the fight against greenhouse gases in many Member States of the European Union. The European initiative of performing stress tests on all our power stations is a first essential and reasonable step which responds to the expectations of European citizens. We must carry out these tests using a common approach and common criteria whose methodology will have to be entrusted to the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group. The neighbouring countries of the European Union should also undergo these tests, given the cross-border risks that exist. Besides these tests, the European Union must work to harmonise international standards at the highest level, within the G20 and the International Atomic Energy Agency, on the basis of the Western European Nuclear Regulators’ Association’s objectives for new reactors. Within the European Union, we should promote and intensify cooperation between the national safety authorities. The European Union must serve as a model, both for the strengthening of the rules and for efforts in solidarity. In the face of this type of disaster, I think that the creation of a European Civil Protection Force is needed more than ever. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 I am delighted that, after five years of negotiations, Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) have been concluded with Cameroon and with the Republic of the Congo. These agreements will help ensure good forest governance by granting FLEGT licences to timber products from these countries and thus guaranteeing the sustainable exploitation and management of their forests. It is essential to have a system by which to monitor movements of timber and derived products from harvesting right up to export. Twenty to thirty per cent of world industrial timber production is illegal, as is 60% of the harvesting that has taken place in Africa over the last 10 years. These VPAs will therefore help preserve the forests in these countries by combating illegal harvesting, which causes significant environmental, economic and social damage. The main advantage of these VPAs is that they will apply to all exports between the EU and these countries, together with all other timber importing countries. I hope that this VPA system will be rolled out quickly to other forest countries. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is quite rightly asking itself whether an oil disaster such as the one that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico could happen in our waters. Since oil spills have destroyed our coasts and left a lasting impression on us numerous times in the past, we quite rightly believe that the preservation and protection of marine ecosystems, animal biodiversity and the economic sectors of fishing and tourism are of paramount importance. However, we must keep a cool head and resist adopting an extreme position which the introduction of a moratorium on any further deep-water oil drilling in Europe would represent. Firstly, because we have very strict safety standards for exploitation and exploration in Europe. Furthermore, national regulators and oil companies in Europe have themselves pledged to amend the exploitation and safety rules and procedures if the outcome of the US investigation into the disaster so demands. Secondly, in view of our requirement for energy independence, it would be highly risky, from a geostrategic point of view, to abandon our North Sea drilling operations. Ultimately, it is the future of our oil industry that we are jeopardising if we shut down its exploration and extraction activities. How could we justify the consequent impact on employment growth in a time of crisis? Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Nowadays, 20-30% of industrial timber production worldwide is from illegal sources. We need to clean up the European timber market as soon as possible. While it could still be improved, the proposed regulation is ambitious and courageous. In my view, it is an effective tool for limiting rampant deforestation, without imposing administrative constraints on our European companies or harming timber, which will, on the contrary, become more highly valued. The regulation establishes a binding provision which delegates responsibilities on the basis of the ‘due diligence system’. This allows operators to trace timber and timber products, to access information on observance of the applicable legislation and, thus, to obtain sufficient guarantees to prevent the sale of products from logging considered to be illegal. The obligations contained in the regulation must target those operators who place timber on the market for the first time, because that is when there is the most risk. Furthermore, in order to guarantee that this regulation is effective, we should emphasise the need for regular controls and a system of stringent, deterrent penalties for offenders.

I am surprised by the absence of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy from the scene of the natural disaster in Haiti. In spite of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union still has difficulty in showing its face on the international stage, and that is most regrettable. It seems to me that the European crisis response system is too fragmented, too complex and not successful enough. In terms of the rehabilitation of Haiti (for which EUR 100 million are earmarked) and the reconstruction of the country (EUR 200 million), what exactly will the EDF and the Stability Instrument fund? Furthermore, to respond to the UN request in terms of logistical and security support, the European Union must, in my view, be in a position to use all the instruments provided by the Treaty of Lisbon, including military response. I call for the rapid establishment of a European civil protection force as devised by Mr Barnier in 2006 with the aim of arriving at a European response that is planned, genuinely coordinated and effective. The recent statements by Mr Van Rompuy are along the right lines. He advocated the creation of a humanitarian rapid reaction force. What will be the exact nature of this project and when will it see the light of day? Gaston Franco  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this summer, once again, the Mediterranean forest was engulfed in flames: in Marseille and in southern Corsica, but also in Italy, in Spain and, on a larger scale, in Greece. More than 400 000 hectares of forest and field went up in smoke, causing considerable material damage, irreparable damage to biodiversity, and the tragic loss of human lives. Dismayed as I am by this assessment made repeatedly, year after year, and mindful as I am of the multiplier effect of global warming on fires, I call for European awareness of the need for more coordinated efforts and for the pooling of fire-fighting resources. I should like to see a huge Euro-Mediterranean cooperation project to combat forest fires take shape under the Union for the Mediterranean. I welcome the existing initiatives and, in particular, the European Forest Fire Information System – the pilot project. Nevertheless, I call for a reform of the European Union Solidarity Fund so that it will become an effective tool for responding to crises. I also call for the strengthening of the European protection force and of the ‘EuropeAid’ facility devised by Mr Barnier in 2006 for intervention on the territory of the 27 Member States, as well as abroad. I believe that one of the keys to the problem of forest fires has to do with information sharing and best practice as regards prevention, and I should like to point out the pioneering role played by the forest fire fighters in my own department. I can, of course, provide Europe with this example, which may be of use. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur
. − Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report today is an assessment of what is now a significant part of European economic governance. I would like to thank the group rapporteurs, with whom I was able − and this is not just words − to undertake genuine constructive work. I believe that this report, taken overall, reflects the concerns of everyone, even if not all have been taken up in a strict sense.  This report was also undertaken in close cooperation with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in accordance with Rule 50, which explains why the report takes up a number of provisions in their entirety, without a vote, so as to properly respect those rules and the ideas of that committee; the rules prevailed. I am not going to list the various points we are emphasising in terms of the Semester content; I would rather talk about what concerned us the most, namely the method. The Semester is, as I was saying, a very important element in establishing coordination of States’ economic and financial policies and involves both European and national levels. That is already something new. In fact, while the Commission’s proposals must next be validated by the Council before being reflected, as far as possible, in national budgets, there is a need, in terms of democratic control, for sound understanding and proper coordination with national parliaments. In this regard, we know − and I do not think anyone will mind me saying − that some of our national parliaments do not fully understand Community Mechanisms and there is a certain apprehension when they see the European level take precedence over national level. That is why some, quite legitimately, assert that national sovereignty entitles them to adopt the budget they want and that they do not have to obey instructions or orders from elsewhere. There is, therefore, undoubtedly work to be done to educate and explain. Indeed, a meeting was recently held in Brussels with the representatives of the financial or economic committees of the national parliaments to explain this European Semester. I had the opportunity, as rapporteur, to say that MEPs have no intention whatsoever of interfering in national relations or the working of national parliaments and that, in reality, the European Parliament and national parliaments have a specific task, that of providing democratic control at their level. I think that in future such meetings will have to be repeated to encourage understanding of the system and its proper application. In this regard, it would certainly be a good thing for these meetings, currently organised in a fairly ad hoc way, to be more formal and, in particular, for those attending the meetings to be able to do so regularly, so that genuine dialogue may be established between national parliaments and the European Parliament. On issues of method, we also stress the need, for instance, for recommendations to be more explicit so that outcomes may be evaluated and, if necessary, corrected. Lastly, I will add that it is also important for States to meet the commitments they have themselves made. It seems an obvious thing to say but, unfortunately, the opposite is often seen. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur
. − Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for passing on our observations to Mr Rehn, but he had taken the trouble of telephoning me yesterday to explain that he would be detained elsewhere today and I was grateful to him for doing so. Sometimes our debates are accused of being simply a string of words with no discernible direct impact on the work presented by the rapporteur. I would like, today, to try to prove the opposite and to respond to those Members − I thank all those who have spoken − who made a request. As regards Ms Trautmann’s request, I will give very serious consideration to withdrawing Amendments 4 and 5. Of course, I have to talk to my Group, since I am a loyal ordinary foot soldier; but I will do all I can to please you and to follow the recommendation made to me, by telephone, by my friend Mr Lamassoure. As regards the reference to the Fiscal Stability Treaty, there is a paragraph where we had fun but, strictly speaking, this reference is not of any consequence. In addition, we could be accused of talking about intergovernmentalism in a Union text; I will therefore also ask the Group for authority to remove paragraph 23 entirely. I hope that, in this way, the excellent cooperative work undertaken during preparation of this report may continue until the vote and thus show Parliament’s determination to make the European Semester a highly effective exercise. In this regard, I would like to say to Ms Zuber –
 I am a little sorry, Commissioner Barnier also just answered her –
 but it seems to me that we are not living in a time bubble and, without European solidarity, I dare not think what would be happening in some countries today. I think that has to be taken into account. Europe is not in the process of oppressing countries in difficulty. I think, on the contrary, that it is endeavouring to help them. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

Mr President, Commissioner, to start with, I would of course like to congratulate you and thank you for the extremely thorough and very expeditious work that you have carried out to introduce the two proposals that are here before us today. We shall play a different role in each of them, which will also be dependent on the legal basis. However, Commissioner, I feel, when I listen to what each of you has to say and read the newspapers, that these negotiations are fraught with danger, because people’s opinions are different. The commitments entered into are not clear. Yet, we are currently being watched closely by our fellow citizens, who want to understand and see what Europe is doing, by our entrepreneurs, who want to know if they can invest, and by the markets, which are anxious to know what to do. I believe that, in the coming months and weeks, the direction that the negotiations take will be a determining factor. I shall not go into technical details here, as they will be the subject of the debate, but I shall merely observe that, unless we show a real European spirit, unless we show that we can set aside short-term national interests and unless we are able to put in place genuinely robust European institutions, all our work will be to no avail and cause disappointment. I am confident in your determination, Commissioner, which I know to be unflagging. You have a record that does credit to you and, therefore, we can say that luck is on our side. It is now up to the Member States to shoulder their responsibilities and rise above squabbles over technical matters. The issue is not how we share out one minor competence or another. The real issue is whether we are able to create banking union, or at least a quality prudential control system, to put finance at the service of the economy. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, I am talking about the rule on blue-card questions. You have just made the observation that I wished to make. I wanted to know whether, on the subject of banking Union, we were not perhaps spectators at an island ping-pong competition. I believe that the system which consists of hijacking the use of blue-card questions by asking questions to friends of one's own group, thereby increasing one's speaking time, is essentially a poor use of the procedure. I am astonished that this should come from a country where fair play is generally held in high esteem. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Madam President, I would like to thank my colleagues for their support and I propose that the report be referred back to committee so that we can start the trialogue discussions and try to reach an agreement at first reading. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Minister, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to recap on why this report has come back to the plenary sitting today, after having been adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). The regulation on countries experiencing difficulties, for which I was rapporteur, was adopted by 25 votes to 4, with 13 abstentions. The abstentions were primarily by the Socialists. However, they did vote in favour of most of the amendments and all of the compromise amendments. Before opening the negotiations, which, from what we have been hearing from the Presidency, will not be easy, I felt it was important to obtain a more solid mandate from plenary. When the time comes, therefore, I will ask that we do not proceed with the vote on the legislative resolution so that, if applicable, we can secure an agreement at first reading. This draft regulation on strengthening economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability in the euro area is set against the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis that the European Union is facing and will continue to face. The Union is trying to learn lessons from the crisis, and to propose solutions. The Commission’s proposals complement the package on economic governance: the ‘six-pack’ adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2011. Excessive national debt can have dramatic consequences, both within the countries concerned and for the other Member States of the European Union. The difficulties of a small country can even have global repercussions. What is at risk is the euro area’s reputation, rather than its existence. The serious economic and social consequences that some Member States are experiencing today could have been avoided if early, targeted action had been taken. At the time, the European Union did not have the necessary instruments, but this will now be put right by the combination of the ‘six-pack’ and two new pieces of legislation (the ‘two-pack’), including this one. The ‘six-pack’ needs to be strengthened, in order to ensure both financial stability and economic growth in the euro area. Several Member States have had to seek financial assistance. Preventive action at an early stage is preferable to corrective measures taken later – perhaps too late – in the proceedings. The broad thrust of the draft regulation adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is in line with the original proposal, which provides for a Member State whose currency is the euro to be subject to enhanced surveillance when it is experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, severe financial disturbance. It should be swiftly returned to a normal situation and the other euro area Member States should be protected against possible negative spillover effects. The regulation sets out clear procedures to this effect for countries experiencing difficulties. The parliamentary committee was keen to increase the powers that the original proposal gave the Commission, in particular, by introducing wider use of the reverse qualified majority rule in Council votes. For example, this rule would apply when the Commission recommends that a country should take corrective measures, or when it instructs a country to submit new debt reduction plans. Such decisions would be deemed to have been adopted unless the Council categorically rejected them. It is worth mentioning that ECON adopted the protection system for States in major difficulties by a wide majority. I would like to point out that there were no negotiations on this amendment and that the vote was left to each individual’s judgment. A majority of our Members chose not to heed the arguments put forward by detractors of this proposal, which were partly based on a distorted presentation of its objective. The intention is not to organise a restructuring or reduction of the debt, but to allow the State to get itself back into shape so that it can deal with its obligations. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, in view of the time, we have to avoid making very long speeches. I would just like to mention to the Commissioner that I share his concern that we should move swiftly and thereby show how effective the community method is. I would like to tell the President-in-Office of the Council, who really could not care less, that it is our firm intention to gain a large majority vote here and to start the trialogue. Before the debate began this morning, there was the matter of Schengen and the Danish Presidency. I hope that on this subject, you will show that you are able to take Parliament’s opinions into account. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Mr President, this tax has caused quite a stir, and we have seen how some of our colleagues have engaged in mudslinging before immediately leaving the debate. I would like to simply reiterate the fact that Parliament has already made its position regarding this tax very clear through several resolutions and decisions. I think that the important thing today is effective implementation, because we are sustaining the report with a whole series of plans, a whole series of words and, behind it, nothing much is happening. In my opinion, it is important for us to be realistic. Since this is a tax matter, Parliament is only being consulted on this report and, in view of this, I feel we must be clear and concise when stating our views. The Commission’s proposal is interesting and good, and I believe we should support it. We must not try to weaken it; there are already strong disagreements within the Council and the chances of seeing the success of this report as we wish, at EU level, are relatively slim. That is why some people suggest that we work in closer cooperation. That is one of the ideas. Parliament is only consulted on this subject, but we should put all the necessary efforts in place. The position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is clear. After discussions and equivocations, the PPE Group is, today, in favour of the financial transaction tax. We would like the tax to be as comprehensive as possible, but, as the PPE Group is realistic, we know that this is not possible in the current climate. We would like the tax to be adopted at European level and that it not be implemented at a lower level, as this would certainly be detrimental to the European financial economy. We must not look the other way: if there were no European internal market – the European market forms a single entity and, personally, I do not believe in running away from things – if it falls to a lower geographical level, there is a real risk.

 Mr President, Mr Fox, we should always be optimistic. Anything can happen. They may see the light. I think that when faced with reality, with the problems of the economic crisis and the need to obtain financial means in a fair way, and also to avoid speculation and ensure the reform of financial activity, everyone can see that this tax would be useful. To reiterate my view, I would like this tax to be established at European Union level. If is it necessary to go in at a lower level, it must not go too low geographically, so as not to create distorted competition, which would be detrimental. I hope that the Member States who are not currently in favour of it will see the light. I am counting on Mr Šemeta’s conviction to drive this report forwards, and I encourage him to do so. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Commissioner, alongside the recovery of public finances, the question of growth is key to the success of the European strategy. In this regard, what is to be the role of the European Central Bank, which has shown extraordinary creativity during the financial crisis? Make no mistake. It is not a matter of making some completely unrealistic revision to the treaty. It is, in reality, about creating political conditions for the ECB to take the action it has undertaken further by buying sovereign debt on the secondary market and injecting liquidity into the financial system. Experience shows that this is possible within the existing legal framework without undermining the independence of the ECB or backtracking on its objectives. It is a question of European solidarity and political will, and not of legal provisions. However, recovery of public finances and prevention of the risk of crises remain a priority. Economic governance of the euro area is being strengthened. Mechanisms for the detection, prevention and sanction of abuses have been reinforced by the ‘six-pack’ initiative. The ‘two-pack’ initiative is under negotiation and there must be a conclusion on this subject soon. This negotiation must particularly make it possible to develop effective, practical measures for the benefit of Member States in difficulty or whose deficits are excessive. In this regard, we must ensure that democratic control is exercised as normal at European level to make the steps to be taken in this area acceptable to the people, the citizens. I would like to conclude by stressing that it would be desirable for the Commission’s proposal to be supplemented by legal protection for any Member State in extreme difficulty – not to encourage complacency but, on the contrary, to allow them to recover and meet their obligations. This provision should be controlled by the Commission under the supervision of the Council and Parliament. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the draft directive aims to implement within the European Union a common consolidated corporate tax base, known as the CCCTB. This has been under discussion since 2004. Today, Parliament, having been asked for its opinion and by way of Marianne Thyssen’s report, wishes – or in any case, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wishes – to send a strong message encouraging the Commission to continue its work in this area. The implementation of a CCCTB in the European Union offers many benefits, both for economic operators – by removing tax obstacles from the internal market – and for Member States – by enabling more transparent and therefore healthier tax competition between Member States. The report, voted through by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and presented by Ms Thyssen, is excellent. After lengthy negotiations and skilful identification of how best to address a very delicate issue, that is to say, the voluntary or optional nature of the system, she is proposing – and has reached agreement on – a phased transition, with the regime becoming immediately compulsory for European companies and cooperatives, to be extended to all companies with the exception of SMEs after five years, following review by the Commission. Commissioner, I believe the Commission should be more demanding in this area. I know the proposal is not strongly supported by several Member States, either due to a principled opposition, such as that of the United Kingdom, to complete tax harmonisation, or due to fears that would be provoked by implementation of this system. This is the stance of Poland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, for example. It must be disregarded. It is crucial for the European Union that this consolidated base, which does not involve a harmonisation of taxes, is implemented. That is the view taken of your proposal by the PPE Group. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Mr President, President Van Rompuy, first of all, let me congratulate you on your reappointment, Mr Van Rompuy. I am among those who, since you were first appointed, have been trying to explain to citizens that your task is a difficult one. I hope that you will continue to execute it with just as much persistence. I know that it is difficult. Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about citizens. I am sorry to have to say today that Europe is losing its credibility. I will not get involved in the national electoral battle: this is neither the time nor the place for that. One may, however, ask why such statements may be publicly accepted. Due to the fact that they are not rejected by public opinion, they are adopted by a very large majority simply because our fellow citizens no longer have any faith in Europe. It may be possible to exercise faith in certain areas. However, I believe that for Europe, what we need is reality. Today, I admire all those who, every month, or every week, make their speeches once again to say the same thing, and I pity those who write them, because what our citizens are looking for is action, and not words. We should spend less time speaking and more time taking action. Today, there are various causes behind the weakening of Europe. The first is, clearly, the way that the crisis has led to nations turning in on themselves. Each country is seeing things only from its point of view, looking at what is going on nationally without taking into account the European dimension, which is the only one that might save us. The second cause is the weakening of the Commission. The Commission appears silent. I am not saying that the Commission is not doing anything: it is working, but no one notices what it is actually doing because there is no clear plan. What is missing is a small package of specific actions that would allow citizens to compare what has been announced with what has been done. Let us take the case of Greece. It is very clear that Greece’s situation is tragic. Why are we giving the impression that it has now been resolved? It has not. One problem has been resolved to allow the plan to work, but in another year or two, problems will arise once again, because strong measures need to be taken. In addition, in the ‘two-pack’ that has been mentioned, I am proposing a safeguard measure for countries in difficulty. However, I was told by the Commission that it was an attack on the market. In fact, when you talk to the markets, what they want is to know where we are going and how we are getting there. They want to stick with the measures that have been taken, and not to change them every fortnight. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, first of all, I would like to say here that I think what is in the treaty could very well appear in European law, and on this point I believe I am in agreement with the Commission. This was said just now by President Barroso, when he stated that the Commission is making proposals to include a number of parties. Therefore, I do not intend to withdraw anything at all. I believe that we need rigour. Only a fool builds his house on the sand. If we now want to get the situation back on track, we must simultaneously balance rigour and growth. Growth, however, is not to be sought in newspaper articles or theories. Growth must be found in innovation, in entrepreneurship, in the mobilisation of entrepreneurs and in confidence. That is what we should work on together. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, every year, the Annual Growth Survey allows us to define the European Union’s economic and budgetary priorities and actions. I should first like to thank the Commission for having published its report before the end of November, thus allowing Parliament to carry out, in good time, some painstaking work. We would like this schedule to become permanent, so that Parliament has time enough to express its views before annual economic guidelines are decided upon by the Spring European Council. This year, on the occasion of the review of this report, Parliament wishes to strongly urge Member States to implement effectively those measures required by the policies that they themselves have undertaken to pursue. Obviously, the primary aim of these measures should be to find a way out of the sovereign debt crisis. They should go hand in hand with a growth strategy based on improving competitiveness. It is clearly also important to promote a sustainable economy which creates jobs. Parliament agrees with the Commission’s analysis that efforts at national and EU level should concentrate on the following five priorities: pursuing differentiated growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, while ensuring economic recovery and job creation; ensuring long-term financing of the real economy; promoting sustainable growth through more competitiveness and investments; tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis, and, finally, modernising EU public administration and services of general interest. As regards fiscal consolidation, Member States should pursue differentiated strategies according to their budgetary situations and keep their public expenditure growth below the rate of medium-term trend GDP growth. Member States must prioritise, on the expenditure and revenue sides of the budget, growth-friendly policies, particularly in the areas of education, research, innovation, infrastructure and energy, and ensure the efficiency of such expenditures and revenues. As regards ensuring the long-term financing of the real economy, Parliament welcomes the determined efforts by Commissioner Barnier to overhaul the regulation and supervision of the financial sector. If investor confidence is to be restored, the banks’ capital positions must be strengthened and measures must be taken to support their access to funding. Thirdly, the promotion of sustainable growth presupposes an increase in the competitiveness of investments. In this respect, Parliament is worried by the macro-economic imbalances within the EU and the fact that many Member States are falling behind in terms of productivity. Enhanced coordination of economic policies as well as structural reforms are needed to tackle these problems in both deficit and surplus countries in an adequate way. Modernising EU public administration and services of general interest is also a determining element of competitiveness and an important productivity factor. In future, Parliament wishes to be more closely involved in drawing up the main political and economic guidelines. It should be noted that the European Semester is now part of EU secondary legislation. The economic governance legal framework provides the tool of economic dialogue to enhance the dialogue between the EU institutions and to ensure greater transparency. We are anxious for this to be so, and I shall conclude shortly after the various speeches to be made, in the two minutes that remain to me, Mr President. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, this is certainly not the best time to speak. However, I, too, would like to commend the excellent cooperation between the rapporteurs, Ms Cornelissen, Ms Berès and myself and the shadow rapporteurs. On the substance of the debate, I would like to say that what is needed today is for words to be backed up by actions, and that is undoubtedly the hardest thing to achieve. As regards its form, I would like to point out that the 2012 European Semester will be the first to come under the new legal framework of enhanced economic governance. In order to ensure that Parliament is well informed, we urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the Commission provides a detailed assessment of the implementation, by the Member States, of the recommendations in each country. The Council, for its part, is required to provide a public explanation of its position within the framework of economic dialogue with Parliament, when its position deviates significantly from the Commission’s recommendations and proposals. It is quite clear that the States can retain a degree of discretion under the principle of subsidiarity. The new legal framework stipulates that Parliament must be duly involved in the European Semester in order to increase transparency and accountability for decisions, particularly through economic dialogue, as provided for by the relevant secondary legislation. In this respect, I should like to conclude by reminding you of the requests made by Parliament to the Council and the Commission in its resolution of 1 December 2011. It is important to give this resolution a precise public response. The reality and effectiveness of the democratic control for which this Parliament is responsible depends on it. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you know how much I appreciate your actions and everything you are doing. The issue we are dealing with this evening is important. It happens that I was rapporteur for the directive on payment services in the previous mandate. I therefore know how important it is to work towards harmonising payment services across Europe. This evening, allow me simply to discuss one issue which angers people: multilateral interchange fees. From the beginning, I have defended these fees and I had the opportunity to do so when we launched the first SEPA transfer in 2007. Interchange fees are legitimate. What is not legitimate is setting them at rates which are excessively high. Why are these fees legitimate? They are legitimate because payment services are a commercial service. The institutions, that is, banks or payment institutions established under Title II of the directive I mentioned just a moment ago, must undertake commercial activity. It is therefore normal that they should receive remuneration. This must obviously be justified by the service provided and, from this point of view, interchange fees — it is true — were, for a certain period of time, set unduly high. However, today, things have changed and the situation we are arriving at thanks to this new text, this regulation, is something of a paradox. Firstly, this text regulates an issue which was under discussion in the Court of Justice of the European Union; it authorises interchange fees at national level until 2017. It bans them sooner for cross-border operations but allows interchange fees to operate if payment is refused or rejected. None of that is very consistent. We must not let what has been done this time serve as an example for the coming regulation on bank cards. Reflection must be better led in this area and the fact that only six countries have resorted to using interchange fees does not mean to say that they are useless. Why? Because otherwise there is no transparency; we would pay for payment services using other means of payment, for example, cheques. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Madam President, Commissioner, Ms Matera, may I say, first of all, that we fully support Ms Matera’s line of argument concerning whether or not the decision to end the crisis derogation was justifiable, and I would like to thank her for all the work she has carried out in this area. I also share your view, Commissioner, on the disastrous impact it will have on the EU’s image if this measure is stopped despite its proven effectiveness. I should like to return briefly to the Renault case – and I also speak on my behalf of my colleague Mr Riquet, who is unable to be here today for personal reasons – in order to say that I also share your assessment of this issue. This case has had its ups and downs, no doubt due to the fact that two aspects have been mixed up: the question of which measures are eligible under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), and the strictly French issue of voluntary early retirement. As you said, there has been a kind of overlapping between the initial agreement and pension reform in France, which extended the period during which workers have to contribute, leaving a number of workers – the number of these varies, as does the time frame – concerned about their future. We share that concern, and it so happens that both Mr Riquet and I are deputies for the constituencies where the affected Renault factories are located. I can assure you that we have spared no effort in trying to encourage Renault to see reason. Just yesterday, I spoke on the phone to the head of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Health, who read Renault’s commitments to me. I believe they are serious about those commitments, but I can guarantee that, at local level, we will make every effort to make sure that the workers affected by this pensions problem – which you said is not directly part of this issue – can see a proper solution to their situation. On the basis of these observations I would call on all my colleagues to grant this assistance to Renault. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 I did not realise that this was what the Commission was proposing. My understanding is that the Commissioner said that he regretted this decision and was going to ensure that borderline cases could be studied in accordance with the criteria in force, but taking account of this crisis situation, which, he said – it seems to me – was going to continue and was going to continue to affect unemployment, unfortunately. That is why I said just now that I was in full agreement with the analysis of the Commissioner and the rapporteur on these matters and that this decision by the Council conveyed entirely the wrong message and gave Europe a very bad image in a difficult period for workers.

 Explanations were given to me just yesterday afternoon by the French Ministry of Labour, the Minister of which was taking steps to enable progress to be made on this issue under, it seems to me, less than pleasant conditions. The issue of pensions has in fact arisen in other French companies and has been resolved, notably at Michelin, for example, which does not come across as an allegedly left-leaning company. What is shocking – and I want to make this clear here and now – is that Renault, 17% of the capital of which is held by the government, has expressed some reservations. However, yesterday I wanted to make sure that these commitments had been made. These commitments – which were read out to me over the telephone, but which I did not get in writing – aim to ensure that people who do not receive an income because of an increase in the necessary contribution periods as a result of pension reform in France can have their contribution shortfalls compensated for, in particular through offers of temporary work. However, on humane grounds, this solution does not seem to me to be very satisfactory. That is why I said that, at local level – because I am in contact with the prefect of the region, and I am fully prepared to work with Ms Grelier to resolve this issue – I believe that, despite our political differences, we both have the same concern that workers who lose their jobs, who entered into an agreement contractually concluded when the situation was different, do not have their rights eroded because of subsequent changes to the legislation. I am perfectly willing to fight this fight, along with Ms Grelier, but I hope it will not come to that. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, of course, I shall say, like most of my fellow Members, that the Polish Presidency has been a success, and has worked effectively over a difficult period. However, contrary to what has just been said, perhaps the high point of this Presidency is the speech looking back over it that you have just given, Prime Minister. You encouraged us with utmost lucidity and a sense of realism – let me remain within the atmosphere of yesterday evening’s Polish Christmas dinner – to examine our consciences. This is something that we do less and less. Everyone shows their satisfaction, self-satisfaction or indulges in self-praise while you, today, asked some hard questions. However, the European Parliament also needs to examine its conscience. It is not enough to demand greater powers, greater cooperation and greater presence. We, too, have to be capable of a rapid and effective response if we are to survive within our institutional environment. I think that we shall have the opportunity to do so over the next few days with the growth report. I happen to have been tasked with the own-initiative report and we are going to suggest that Parliament be allowed to intervene and make proposals in relation to the Commission’s proposals, either to support them or to suggest new approaches. Today, the time has come to have a renewed democracy and Parliament must have a place within it. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this work that has just been done deserves to be highlighted and also deserves to be recognised for what it is. The work that has been done is an example of excellent cooperation with the rapporteur, Ms Berès, and I believe that tomorrow’s vote will show that it expresses the will of the vast majority of this House. Why is this the case? Because at stake here is the democratic scrutiny of procedures aimed at improving economic integration and cooperation among States. Clearly, Parliament is not asking to be an executive, nor is it asking to take the place of the national parliaments. However, everyone has a part to play at his or her respective level. The merit of this own-initiative report, which is perhaps a little longer than normal, is that it proposes practical solutions for this association, by adopting two points of view. Firstly, the point of view of the current Treaty, of the current rules. The rapporteur makes proposals on how to increase Parliament’s involvement so as to ensure democratic scrutiny. However, the report also reflects on the possibility of amending the Treaties and, at that point, indicates the improvements or the changes that should be made to guarantee this effective democratic scrutiny, which guarantees the legitimacy of the measures taken and negotiated at European and individual Member State levels. I should like to return to two specific points that were raised a moment ago, starting with the subcommittee on the euro. We have abandoned it so as not to create a divide among MEPs, but this report rightly points out that, when the time comes, Parliament will have to adapt to the structure adopted by the Member States within the Council or within the euro area. There is also the quasi-legislative, or quasi-codecision, issue. We must be practical and implement, on the basis of the Annual Growth Survey, a mechanism that allows Parliament to give its opinion, vote on amendments and, as the rapporteur was saying earlier, ensure that our President has a proper democratic mandate. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, Mr Juncker, I obviously agree with what was said by Mr Daul, Mr Langen and Mr Mauro, so I will not go back over the same ground. I want to talk to you about something else, about what citizens understand. Last night, I was with a hundred or so citizens who were asking me about the crisis, as, unfortunately, it is one of the issues that I am dealing with. What we need to do now for Europe is win the citizens over and, above all, get them on side. You have two categories of citizens: those who give in to the lure of populism and who scream and shout ‘Europe is a failure; Europe is good for nothing’; and then you have all the other citizens, larger in number, who say ‘We expect a lot from Europe, but Europe is not convincing us in what it is doing’. It is therefore our job to convince these citizens together. What is more, I say convince the citizens before convincing the markets. I have heard endless talk about the markets; I know the markets and I know them professionally. Has nobody ever told you that the markets will never be satisfied? They will always ask for more. There is a change of government in Italy, and now they are saying that it needs guarantees that it will do this or that. When it has done this or that, they will ask it to do something else. The politicians need to regain control. The markets are useful. The economy needs them. They allow it to work. However, they should not take advantage. When I see the Commission back down, yesterday, on the credit rating agency project, on innovative proposals which, in my opinion, did not go far enough, this is no way to convince the markets. This is proof that we are all weak, that we give in to those who put pressure on us, forgetting that we are here to serve the citizens. You can count on this Parliament. I have just heard that Mr Schulz endorsed the ‘Six Pack’, which he did not vote for. That just proves that here, once you have voted, you are able to follow the Commission, to help it. Mr Barroso, you have just said ‘Help us!’ Does Parliament not help the Commission to move Europe forward? Then let us all be courageous and brave together. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, I note from the Commissioner’s speech that the Semester has been a success. I can only be pleased about that. With Europe in the throes of a major crisis, this tool, as it is called, needs to help move the situation forward. I should like to address, in particular, the Council representative. It took you 16 minutes to explain the mechanism, which we were familiar with, and to tell us that all this is very technical, that it is ultimately too much for one to understand and that, if Parliament wants to be informed, then it is in luck, because it can consult the documents that are updated for the general public online. You might also tell us to read the newspapers, which we do as a matter of course. I find it quite shocking that the only response to the question that was asked about Parliament’s role in the European Semester was that we should read the newspapers and search the Internet and we will learn just as much about it. You know, when we meet our fellow citizens – and I wonder whether you ever have cause to meet them yourself – they ask us: ‘What is Europe doing with regard to these issues?’ Until now, we would tell them: ‘Ah, we have developed the European Semester!’ Well today, the European Semester is a damp squib. That is what I wished to say to you, Mr Dominik. The method that has been applied excessively for some months now is certainly not one that will enable Europe to overcome the crisis. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, what we need to do is to restore confidence: to restore the confidence of the public, to restore the confidence of economic operators, and to restore the confidence of the markets. We will not convince the markets by endlessly proposing to increase the funds mobilised for bailouts. On the contrary, we will weaken our position. We will not convince the markets by announcing, day in day out, measures that are not enforced. We will not convince the markets by showing that the banks need to be recapitalised but not indicating how or why. We will not convince the markets with rules that, once decreed, are not applied. This is the case where rating agencies are concerned, Commissioner. The three main rating agencies are still not accredited, are still not supervised, and continue to put an excessive strain on the financial markets. It is therefore time to do something to convince the markets, Commissioner. The European institutions need to solve the real crisis, that of policy making. It is up to the President of the Commission and you to adhere strictly to the principles that you have defined and with regard to which you have the support of Parliament.  (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, a few days ago, I told you, in a friendly way, a number of things. You have not missed today’s opportunity. We heard – at last, I would say – these strong words that are necessary if we want to address the political decision crisis that we are in, for beyond the economic, financial and social crisis that you described, and the confidence crisis, there was and is a political decision crisis. By asserting today loud and clear the Commission’s role and its constructive proposals – of which some have already been implemented, on financial regulation in particular – and thanks to this Parliament, thanks to what will be voted for later on I hope, and thanks to the joint work that we will once again undertake – like Mr Schulz said earlier on – I think that we can make Europe move forward in the right direction and give you all the support you need, and that, henceforth, you fully deserve.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Minister, the current uncertainty over the EU’s response to the crisis is particularly harmful, firstly for the countries concerned, but also for the markets, on which the pressure is becoming unbearable and dangerous. I would like to raise a purely technical issue in relation to this point. Since we recognise that a Member State may default, it is now crucial to define rules to govern this situation. When a business becomes insolvent, there are exceptional rules to protect it. However, there are no such rules for Member States, because it has long been accepted that Member States cannot default. Yet, the example of Greece clearly shows that constant pressure on a Member State prevents planned measures from being implemented effectively. It follows that the European Union must decide, within the framework of the euro area, which rules shall prevail. Membership of the euro area creates an original and ambiguous situation for every Member State: it is no longer the one issuing its currency, but its financial policy is still out of sync with that of the other countries. Clearly, the first imperative is the rapid completion of the economic policy coordination arrangements and of the European Stability Mechanism, but we also need to establish the rules that will apply in this area. In the case of countries under arrangements with the European Union or the International Monetary Fund, this would involve introducing provisions to freeze clauses concerning early repayment, forfeit of terms or credit events, which are today standing in the way of a genuine recovery. Introducing such provisions would ensure both transparency and credibility. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to use an image much loved by the Commissioner, this is a new brick in the regulatory and supervisory system that he is courageously and effectively putting in place. A new brick, and soon there will be another one, with short selling. To ensure that those bricks are firmly in place, however, we need the Council’s agreement, and that is why I believe we should make the most of the coming days in order to try to make a success of a trialogue that will enable us to reach a decision at first reading. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is in favour of postponing the vote on the legislative resolution until the next part-session. Doing so will give the negotiators time to reach a proper agreement. As Mr Langen, who has done a remarkable job in this difficult affair, said, this agreement specifically deals with the role of, and supervision by, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). ESMA is a key element in this financial regulatory system that has been established. The conditions must be in place, at European level, for that authority to carry out all aspects of its role, which is very important in this case. On the issue of scope, we support the rapporteur’s proposal to limit it to over-the-counter derivatives and their markets; it is also important to consider the issues of interoperability and of third countries. I would also point out that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in an effort to be practical, believes that there is no point in imposing the provisions retrospectively, except, perhaps, in the case of transactions that are carried out over a long period of time. This system is difficult and complicated, but it is vital if we are to prevent a repeat of the financial crises we have gone through. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I have a comment and a request to make. My comment is to emphasise that, thanks to Mr Stolojan’s work, we have been able to reach an agreement at first reading; I hope that this dossier will encourage the Council to successfully conclude the negotiations on the three other dossiers. Then I would like to ask you, Mr President, to give the floor to Mr Bodu. He mixed up the texts before and was supposed to take the floor on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs. I am making this request as coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, having listened to this debate as a layman, I think that we need to show some common sense in this affair. When crises occur, the citizens are the ones who directly or indirectly pay the consequences. I believe that when they realise the absurdity of selling something that one does not own, or of insuring against a risk for which one is not liable, they understand that this is an inappropriate system. I believe that we should try today to apply some common sense to this complex financial legislation, so that the human spirit is back at the heart of this work, instead of computer programs that are all configured in the same way to ensure that, when ridiculous transactions take place, no one really understands what is going on. I believe that Parliament has adopted some reasonable positions, and I hope that the Council will support them. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of this text is clearly to protect private investors from the fraudulent or deeply flawed practices of investment firms. This text is designed to increase confidence after a crisis in which retail investors, as you said, Commissioner, were definitely the most vulnerable stakeholders and the ones who suffered the most. It is important to understand that this text provides for the payment of compensation as a last resort. It is not paid out on an ad hoc basis, but as a last resort. That is why our committee unanimously adopted this report, which seeks to fully harmonise the rules and to increase the ceiling to EUR 100 000. In the specific case of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), the Commission’s feeling was not that measures to protect investors should be overlooked, but that this very specific product, which, incidentally, has an excellent reputation, deserved its own rules to be laid down as part of the revisions of the UCITS Directive. That is why the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has asked your Commission to undertake a study to discover what the advantages and disadvantages would be of extending the scope of this Directive on compensation for private investors to include UCITS. It is now up to the Council to agree so that the text that we adopted at first reading – since we will also be voting on the legislative resolution – can quickly be applied. I repeat: for Europeans and private investors, there is also a feeling of belonging to the European Union which must take the form of equivalent protection for all. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, many comments have already been made on the different reports that make up this governance package. What are the most important points, at this stage, to help us appraise the work that has been done? The fact that we have this package today, which is the result of negotiations between the Council and Parliament, already constitutes considerable progress. It fills an obvious gap in the development of the euro, and sadly it took the debt crisis to prompt us to do this. In this respect, we should stress the commendable work done by the Hungarian Presidency and the quality of the negotiators from this Parliament. I would also like to emphasise the results that Parliament obtained in the discussions with the Council, as the latter demonstrated genuine openness. We must remember how the situation used to be and measure the improvements objectively. Having said this, are these provisions satisfactory, and are they enough? There is always room for improvement, of course, but this package already provides real solutions to strengthen the euro area and to create the concerted economic approach that is needed. Can we seriously argue, as the opponents of this package do, that we can build growth on top of a mountain of debt that is continuously put off further and further into the future? To those who blame us for supporting a governance package that is not based on any theoretical or econometric model, I will simply say this: did the models you are talking about foresee or prevent the crisis we are going through and that has not ended yet; or did they lead, instead, to high-risk behaviours under the cover of mathematical truth? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow Parliament will have to make its decision, and I hope it will send out a signal loud and clear, both to our citizens, to restore their confidence in Europe, and to the markets, to stabilise our currency. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I rise on behalf of Mrs Lulling and Mr Langen, too; they had their own speaking time, but I assure you that I will not use it all up. I would just like to point out, as every one of you has done here, that the process of selecting a new Managing Director of the IMF has begun. It is important for the European Union to express a unanimous and strong position that is conveyed not only by the various Member States, but also by the Commission, and you have pledged to do that, Commissioner. Many of us in this House, with the exception of Mr Farage, are very keen to see the balance – a popular one until now – between the United States and Europe maintained during the process of appointing the Managing Director of the IMF and the President of the World Bank. We fully understand that emerging countries – particularly the largest ones – would like more of a say in the IMF’s decision making. It is important, therefore, to continue the reforms under way regarding the governance of that international institution, and particularly the ones that you also mentioned, Commissioner. However, it is definitely too soon for any radical changes to the balance achieved as a result of the Member States’ respective financial contributions to the Fund. Only one European candidate has launched a proper campaign by making contact with the various Member States. That candidate – who, by the way, is a woman – has the qualities required. Her skills, political experience, moral authority and perfect command of English, coupled with her experience of working across the globe, make her the ideal candidate for the post of Managing Director of the IMF. As has been said, the Managing Director must be someone who seeks consensus and is effective at a time when the institution has a vital role to play in helping to redress the economic and financial balance with a great sense of purpose. Our Union must therefore do whatever it takes to secure Christine Lagarde’s appointment. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, as you acknowledged just now, last year’s tests have not had the anticipated effects. We ought to avoid the same errors of conception and implementation. The fields of investigation must be consistent and similar. There will be no stabilisation if the diagnosis is not correct. Governments must be aware of that. This being so, the tests must quite clearly be realistic. The solutions that you have just given us, in a particularly detailed fashion, are of a kind that can provide an answer to our questions. It is now the job of the European Banking Authority, in supervising and examining the conclusions of these tests, to give a first test of its effectiveness. The tests must allow us to better define the potential recapitalisation needs of the banks and to take the measures that you have just mentioned. However, performing credible stress tests is the best way to calm the financial markets and to limit the influence of credit rating agencies and the negative effects of their decisions on the whole of our economy. The credibility of the results of these tests can end the dependency on these agencies, or at least can reduce it. The supervisory authorities have no choice but to ensure that the tests are successful; that is, that they provide convincing evidence. Let me use my allotted time, Commissioner, to draw your attention to the fact – in my opinion, a serious one – that the legislation relating to credit rating agencies, which has now entered into force, has not been applied, and that the authorities to which these agencies submitted their files did not take steps to inform them of the requirements of the agreement. We planned a transitional period pending the establishment of the European Securities and Markets Authority, yet today we are continuing to act as if nothing had happened. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, after the remarks that I have just heard, which are unworthy of this House, I should like to tell you that the majority of us believe that the EIB’s action is very positive. The improvements made by the Treaty of Lisbon provide new scope for action, which should help the EIB to become even more effective and to provide relevant solutions to the global financial crisis. As you emphasised, the EIB provides real support to small and medium-sized enterprises and makes a crucial contribution to the EU’s cohesion policy convergence objective. Those actions must be pursued and, if possible, increased. The EIB must do more to promote strategic investments in Europe, and so I should like to invite you to support those who have taken initiatives to improve long-term financing and, in particular, deposit and consignment offices − the caisse des dépôts
 and cassa dei depositi
 − and KfW. I believe that they should be supported, because the banking regulations and accounting regulations that are developed today do not encourage us to factor in long-term investment and penalise those who opt for it. Moreover, contrary to what is often said, we need changes and not just adaptations. Long-term financing is, as you also said, essential in order to open up a new horizon for Europe. Outside the European Union, you are right to say that the EIB must act as a driving force and hence must propose initiatives, in particular, for the financing of the Mediterranean countries. In the current turbulent conditions affecting a good many of those countries, the EIB can make a useful contribution to economic development within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean through its targeted financing, and can thus help to establish democratic civilisation in those countries whose future is still uncertain. I have noted your willingness to make that contribution if the Union asks you to do so, which I hope it will. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. 
– (FR)
 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I agree, of course, with what Mr Brok said. I should just like to draw attention to two points: the important thing today is to have legal certainty. In other words, there should be no ongoing debate regarding the legal bases of action that may be taken at European level, whether it be intergovernmental or Community action; our preference, of course, is for Community action. Why do we need this legal certainty? Because Europe and the euro area are under constant pressure from the markets. We cannot destroy the markets but we can try to bring them under control. To do so, we must eliminate uncertainty, the decisions that are put off each day, and we must stop constantly wondering whether or not we can take decisions. It is therefore a matter of urgency, Commissioner, for you to heed Parliament’s requests and for us to quickly amend the Treaty so as to guarantee this legal certainty, which is necessary in order to respond effectively to the difficult economic circumstances we are facing. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, I regret that there is some confusion in this report by Mrs Podimata, which raises a number of important issues with regard to innovative financing. I would like to ask the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament to withdraw the alternative motion it has tabled so that the joint drafting work that has been carried out can be concluded. Secondly, I regret that a slightly artificial opposition has emerged on the issue of a tax on financial transactions and that there are two very similar amendments. I regret that, as a result, Parliament cannot express its overwhelming support for this tax in conditions that are reasonable with regard to Europe’s competitiveness. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).  
– (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot but endorse what has just been said by Mrs Goulard on the basic presuppositions that mean that while we are well aware of the need for effectiveness and speed in the decision-making process, it is essential for Parliament to be involved. This is the only way in which our fellow citizens, of whom we are the elected representatives, can understand what is happening and explain it to them. I would like to raise one very specific point. We are buffeted, on a daily basis, by the financial markets, these financial markets, which stand for everything and for nothing, are most often inhabited by young people who have moved from Game Boy
 to computer without thinking too much about it, and yet who strike fear into the hearts of our countries. The way to bring the markets under control is not to eliminate them. I do not belong to a group that seeks to abolish the markets. However, what do the markets seek? They seek to avoid risk and the rule of the game in the markets is to pass risk on to someone else. This means that an operator will never feel happy as long as there is risk. I feel that if we are to have an impact on these financial markets, Europe must be able to draw some very clear lines, not change direction every other day, and not bubble with hosts of ideas which are never, subsequently, put into practice. If we want to bring this financial aspect under control, and this is vital for the economic stability of our countries, we need to be able – and it is your role, Mr Barroso, to provide this impetus – to set clear goals, clear measures and to show a clear determination in regard to good economic coordination. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to make two comments in relation to form: the rapporteur has just acknowledged all those who contributed to this report. This work was indeed a real team effort, in which our group member, Mrs Hübner, was particularly involved as shadow rapporteur. However, I have learned that the socialist group has submitted an alternative resolution, which means that a document on which there has been no consultation shall be put to the vote first. My second political comment – I do not usually make such comments – is that we are creating an artificial opposition here, especially with regard to the tax on financial transactions. The position of our group is clear: we are in favour of such a tax at global level; we are in agreement with it being trialled in Europe if it cannot be trialled globally. We simply feel that we cannot rush into this kind of decision without carrying out a thorough impact assessment in order to verify that the competitiveness of Europe’s financial centres will not be affected. In this regard, Commissioner, I would like to state clearly that the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is not to play for time, or to put matters on standby. We urgently and strongly request that the impact assessment which we have repeatedly discussed in this Parliament be duly and promptly carried out to allow us to make an informed decision on the matter. I think that, on the one hand, there is the hype which the opinion columns in some European newspapers serve to create, and, on the other, there is the real situation, where we have to manage this issue seriously by having a thorough knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages and making a political decision as quickly as possible. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, I will address an issue that has been raised on several occasions and often presented as a single reason: speculation. I believe that, with regard to speculation, moderation is required. It is clear that there is a definite link between certain financial activities and increased volatility and prices for raw materials. However, looking at the entire issue solely in terms of financial speculation would certainly be a mistake, since part of what we call speculation is actually the legitimate hedging of prices on the part of producers and, as we are well aware, these producers could not do without this hedging possibility. However, a situation must be avoided in which direct investment in commodities has a harmful impact on price volatility because of its massive scale or its purely speculative nature. In this regard, the proposals made by Commissioner Barnier on financial matters, in particular the regulation of short selling and derivatives, and also the revision that is going to come from the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), must give Parliament the opportunity to take account of aspects of commodities speculation in financial regulation and supervision, which will be put in place to ensure that those markets are also regulated in an effective yet pragmatic manner. Commissioner, you said that these efforts should continue, and I believe that Parliament which, in a financial crisis, has complied with and, sometimes, anticipated what the Commission proposed, will live up to its responsibility. Finally, I welcome the declaration of the Hungarian Presidency indicating that Europe would support the French Presidency of the G20, which has made the regulation of the commodities markets one of its priorities.

 Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Barnier, this debate right now is not a legal debate; it is a true political debate. It is a debate on the future of financial regulation in Europe. It is the culmination of one aspect of the work conducted by Parliament, with the Council, under the guidance of the Commission. I am therefore going to be quite clear. For us, it is not about indulging in some sort of revolution or showing our biceps just for fun. It is about ensuring that the spirit that presided over the agreements between the Council and Parliament is, in fact, respected. It is not a lesson in law. The texts do not matter. We know the texts. What matters is the way in which these texts will be put into effect. In this regard, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the clarity of his speech. We have never sought to call the Commission into question, and the words spoken by the Commissioner are totally in accordance with the wishes of Parliament. We are talking here about a political act that consists in saying: ‘These institutions have been established, so we must give them the concrete resources to function properly.’ Yet, I think that we do not simply have doubts but also suspicions about the way in which these provisions have in fact been implemented by a number of Member States, by those that wish to unravel European supervision and prevent financial regulation at European level. That is what we are speaking out against, because we believe that, if that had been the case, we would have been cheated in the negotiations on supervision. The negotiations were long; they were difficult. Everyone made compromises. The Belgian Presidency did some remarkable work and the Commissioner provided extraordinary impetus. Today, we could be faced with institutions without effective power: due to the low status of the staff appointed; due to the fact that the Member States did not choose the best, and perhaps because the salaries were not attractive. In any event, today Parliament needs a concrete answer. Minister, I am bound to say that, despite the friendship that I feel for you, having sat on the same bench, in the same group and on the same committee as you, the letter, which I have seen and which, I admit, is only a first draft, is inadequate. I will give you the response of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is simple. You say, on behalf of the Council, that you fully endorse what the Commissioner has just said. I can tell you that, for us, this will be a satisfactory declaration. The statement made by the Commissioner is precise. It deals with problems of human and financial resources. Your letter needs to state: ‘We agree with virtually everything the Commissioner said’. Mrs Győri, this is very important. We agree with virtually everything the Commissioner said in plenary this evening. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I have listened to this long debate as a citizen. I would say that Mr Barroso’s proposals were very interesting. We would like to see them acted upon. A clear and comprehensible political will and a discourse of truth are the necessary conditions for restoring our citizens’ confidence. It is imperative that we do not mask realities. There is public spending, which we must cover or reduce. There are public and private debts, which we must repay. There are numerous experts who have ideas on everything. Those who did not see the crisis coming are now full of brilliant solutions. But in a difficult situation, let us use common sense. Let us not reproduce in the management of public finances the mistakes and errors of the private sector that led to the financial and banking crisis. Sophisticated arrangements do not create value and wealth. They create illusions and often benefit only the speculators. The fact of the matter is that the Member States have lived beyond their means. We must have the courage to draw the necessary conclusions and ensure that the burden of recovery is apportioned fairly. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, this is a purely technical amendment, to take into account the date that the regulation establishing the European Securities and Markets Authority will come into effect and the fact that this regulation can only come into effect at a later date. We should consequently adapt one recital and one article of the text on which we are going to vote. In recital 22, we should cut the second sentence and in article two, I also suggest that we cut the second sentence. This oral amendment has been the subject of an item of information and an agreement by the different groups that signed the compromise agreement. This text we will be voting on today completes the regulation of rating agencies and is part of the European Union’s policy to improve the regulation of financial services. I should like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Barnier and the Belgian Presidency for their very strong involvement in this issue. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, here we are in the third act of the financial legislation for 2010. Following supervision, following the directive on alternative investment fund managers, we are once again looking at credit rating agencies. I say ‘once again’ because Europe has not been slow in bringing in a regulation in this area which was conceived in 2009 and which is now taking effect. Credit rating agencies, in general, issue opinions, literally in the form of ratings, on the creditworthiness of businesses and states and on complex financial products. The rating reflects an assessment of the risk of issuers of financial instruments not being able to honour their debts. These agencies have gradually become very important in the financial world, for a variety of reasons. First, ratings are taken into account in banking regulations in order to determine the amounts of own funds that will be used to back investments. The second reason is that ratings have been a factor in the success of issues, since they have become a major indicator for investors. Yet, although credit rating agencies were not the main cause of the recent financial crisis, they did have a harmful influence. Indeed, they underestimated the probability that issuers of certain complex financial instruments would default. Faced with the need to restore confidence in the markets and to strengthen protection for investors, in 2009, the European Commission proposed a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies. Thus, in the same year, Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies was adopted. During the debates in the European Parliament preceding the adoption of this regulation, your rapporteur stressed the need for EU-wide joint oversight of credit rating agencies’ products and integrated supervision of them. At the time, European supervision of this type was legally impossible. However, the Commission undertook to draft a legislative proposal along these lines, and you, Commissioner, kept this promise. The agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament on the architecture of European supervision, which will enter into force on 1 January 2011, now makes the effective implementation of rating agency supervision possible. It is stressed in the Regulation establishing the European Securities and Markets Authority that this authority will exercise its own supervisory powers in relation, in particular, to credit rating agencies. That was the objective of the additional amending regulation on which we reached an agreement and on which we will vote tomorrow. What I wanted – and my colleagues supported this request – was for the other issues relating to credit rating agencies, allocation of sovereign debt, remuneration schemes and competition, to be postponed and dealt with in a study taking the form of an own-initiative report, which will precede the legislative proposal that you are due to make in the first half of 2011 and for which you have launched a consultation. I believe that, by establishing European supervision of credit agencies, we are taking a big step along the same lines as the supervision arrangements that have been implemented. I now want to thank the Belgian Presidency for its tireless efforts on the financial dossiers, you and your teams, Commissioner, and, obviously, my fellow Members in the European Parliament who participated in this study and who supported our positions. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, after the comments that you have heard, you can draw two conclusions. The first is that Parliament will overwhelmingly support this report tomorrow, which will show once again that Parliament, or a large majority of it, appreciates the actions on regulation and supervision that are being taken by the Commission and which have been strongly supported by the Belgian Presidency. The second conclusion that we can draw is that I will not come to a conclusion today, but that a new debate will open up, on the basis of this consultation, of Mr Klinz’s own-initiative report, to examine all these difficult questions. Thus, we cannot avoid the fact that in 2009, when we brought about the first regulation, we were already asking ourselves these questions. If we have not dealt with these questions, it is because we have not found an appropriate response. I hope, therefore, that, thanks to the thought that is being given to the matter with the submission of Mr Klinz’s report, the discussion about consultation which is taking place will this time enable us to provide responses to complete the regulation on rating agencies. In conclusion, however, if you will allow me, I will repeat a phrase by the President of the Securities and Markets Authority, who said that, at the very least, it would be good if the financial markets detoxified themselves of the rating agencies to allow investors to gain a greater personal appreciation of situations and risks. I think that that would also be a guarantee. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Mr President, I believe that I have one minute if what I have been told is correct. President-in-Office of the Belgian Presidency, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to say, Minister, how much I appreciated your lucid assessment of the latest G20 and how supportive I am of your proposals for the future. I think it really must be said that the results have been fairly poor, even though Basel III and the IMF reform were approved. We can only hope, like the President of the Commission, that the Seoul summit paves the way for the implementation of the French Presidency’s ambitious proposals, which are justified by immediate need and the ongoing difficult circumstances. The European Union will need to be consistent if it is to carry the weight it deserves. Concrete results are essential, and I agree with you, President of the Commission, when you say that our fellow citizens are expecting action and not mere words or statements. The globalisation of the economy and finance require us to make real progress in the international harmonisation of regulations. Markets react much quicker than politicians. Europe must not be naive and must ensure that there is reciprocity. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).  
– (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, as the coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to emphasise two points in your programme. Firstly, strengthening economic governance and initiating the European Semester. We were pleased to welcome the package on economic governance. Achieving this target is critical. In this respect, our group would like to see effective and binding measures that go further than what is being proposed. It is also necessary for Parliament to be truly involved in finalising the processes envisaged and in their implementation. Legal bases should be found to prevent the treaties from being substantially amended, which would only slow down the implementation of measures that must be taken. The second point concerns the continuation of the work on financial regulation. The projects are on the table, or will be soon. 2011 will be a decisive year. We appreciate Commissioner Barnier’s pro-activeness. In 2010, Parliament showed its determination in adopting the supervision package, the directive on alternative investment fund managers and, in all likelihood by the end of the year, the regulation that will set up the European supervision of credit rating agencies. We want to continue on the path of a pragmatic, intelligent and effective regulation. That is what we are expecting from the Commission today. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Mr President, Mr Trichet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, I join the chorus of praise for the ECB’s work, and I shall not repeat what my colleague, Mr Balz, said or what is said in the resolution. In the short time allotted to me, I would simply like to say that we must consider our fellow citizens. Why do I say that in this way today? Because, yesterday evening, on all the French television channels, a future presidential candidate made a spectacle of himself by tearing up a EUR 10 note that he had photocopied and enlarged, and showing that, by tearing up that note, he was tearing up the cause of all our ills. Of course, that is not true. All that is needed is for us to make an effort, together, to communicate. The work that has been carried out in terms of supervision, organisation and regulation, to which you have referred, Mr President, is excellent. You know you have Parliament’s support: you said so yourself. However, we have a real task on our hands with regard to those of our fellow citizens who do not understand the messages that are being conveyed. Every day, the headlines in the press are of increasingly grim solutions and unlikely situations, and I can tell you that, on Friday, when I was out in the field, as we say in politics, I saw nearly 100 to 150 people. They all asked me the same question: what is going to happen with the euro? The fear felt by our fellow citizens is out of sync with what is being done, and done well, by the European Central Bank.

rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote that you are going to cast concerns one of the key elements of Europe’s response to the financial crisis, namely, the regulation of alternative investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. This compromise document, this compromise text, has been long in the making. We have succeeded in reaching a broad agreement, and I should like to pay tribute here, before the ECOFIN President, to the Belgian Presidency, which has been directly and significantly involved in this matter, in particular, through the Minister’s active participation in key trialogues, and I should also like to thank Commissioner Barnier, whose work has been particularly useful. Lastly, I should also like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs, the Secretariat staff and the experts who assisted us. This work took more than 14 months, and there were 1 690 amendments. It was a lot of work, but I believe that today, we have come up with a text that, thanks to the Belgian Presidency, marks a significant step forward in the field of European financial regulation.

Mr President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, the text we are debating this evening, and which will be put to the vote in Parliament tomorrow, is the result of a long period of work. On 30 April 2009, the European Commission published its proposal for a directive on alternative investment fund managers. It aims to establish a safe, harmonised framework at European Union level to monitor and supervise the risks presented by managers for their investors, their counterparties, other actors in the financial markets and financial stability, while making it possible for managers, subject to observing strict requirements, to provide services and market their funds throughout the internal market. Mr President, may I just pause a moment, I wanted to know whether, given the length of our work, I had no time limit, because I see that the clock has not started. It does not bother me but, for honesty’s sake, I wanted to draw it to your attention. Parliament received the text about 14 months ago. It has aroused obvious interest among Members of the European Parliament, as a record number of 1 690 amendments have been tabled. Professionals have been involved very extensively and the rapporteur has had nearly 200 discussions on this text, not counting the discussions with national authorities. Finalising the compromise text that is being debated today has been particularly hard work. Half a dozen informal trialogues took place under the Spanish Presidency during the first half of 2010 in order to facilitate the exchange of information on the progress of the work. No agreement was reached in the Council during this period. On 17 May 2010, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, by a large majority, voted in favour of the report, which was the result of collective deliberation by Members of the European Parliament. Parliament introduced proportionality, differing rules for different categories of funds, regulation to protect the private equity of target companies and jobs and a passport system for funds and alternative investment fund managers based outside of the European Union. There then followed a dozen trialogues. A working party was also set up between the three institutions specifically to deal with the technical aspects of the proposal in a number of meetings with the Belgian Presidency and the Commission. On 26 October 2010, the trialogue, which was to become conclusive, was held, with the active participation of the President of ECOFIN, Mr Reynders, and of Commissioner Barnier, and an agreement was reached on a compromise text which the rapporteur felt could be put to the vote in Parliament. I shall not go into the detail of this lengthy technical document but will highlight the essential points. The directive will make it obligatory for alternative investment fund managers located in the European Union to be authorised or registered, and to comply with operational and organisational requirements, codes of conduct and transparency rules, and will make them subject to the power of the competent authorities of the Member States and of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to supervise and to impose sanctions. It will give them access to the Union’s internal market by means of an intra-European passport to manage and market their products. Eventually, managers based outside of the European Union will be able to qualify for a passport provided they meet the same requirements as managers whose head office is in the European Union. The number of meetings and the intensity of exchanges and negotiations between the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, the Presidency at the time and the Commission have very significantly enriched the initial proposal in a number of areas. In this respect, I need to make it clear that the progress sought by Parliament was achieved gradually in the course of negotiations and not, of course, only in the last trialogue during which some adjustments were made, but at the political level, it was decisive. I would now like to emphasise the areas in which Parliament’s intervention has been decisive. First of all, on two highly political issues, with regard to relations with third countries, the existence and implementation of a passport – well, now I really do not understand because normally I have four minutes – for managers residing outside of the European Union have been approved. Specific conditions for the granting of a passport have been laid down. With regard to private equity, Parliament has succeeded in ensuring that the directive includes provisions to avoid potential asset stripping of the target company and also specific rules concerning reporting obligations in relation to target companies, their employees or their representatives. Given the erratic behaviour of the clock, I shall not go back over some of the provisions that were achieved in accordance with Parliament’s wishes. I shall simply say that Parliament would have liked to have gone further, but it was able to influence negotiations so as to give more recognition to the ESMA’s role. The solutions that were upheld nonetheless constitute significant progress towards improving monitoring at European level. Parliament has been careful to strengthen the powers of the Council and of Parliament in the process of adopting acts delegated by the Commission. A majority in Parliament would have liked very strict control over passive marketing, or even its prohibition. The inclusion in a recital of the principle whereby professional investors have to carry out due diligence when they invest in funds located outside of the European Union constitutes a significant first step. That, Mr President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, is what I wanted to say in opening the debate. In closing, I shall take this opportunity of two minutes to thank all those who have contributed to this success. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, earlier, I spoke about the technical details. Allow me to use my last two minutes to express some richly deserved thanks: thank you first of all to all the fellow Members who have spoken today. My especial thanks to those who have said that they will be supporting the text, but to those who will not be voting in favour, I do not believe that putting me in the same bracket as Mr Cameron is really an insult either. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the groups: Mr Goebbels, Mr Bullmann, Mr Canfin, Mr Klute, and Mrs Regner, the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. I wanted to name them all in recognition of the incredible support that they gave me during the first phase of this process. We were able to work together productively, each putting forward his or her own points of view, and I would like to thank them for that. I am delighted that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the European Conservatives and Reformists have joined us now that a compromise has been reached and hence, I am delighted that Mr Klinz and Mr Kamall have co-signed with me the amendment that replaces the initial report. Particular thanks go to Mr Barnier for his considerable involvement in this dossier: he knows how much I appreciate him. I know that he knows that Parliament is relying on him and will support him in putting in place these building blocks that are so dear both to him and to us. I know it is unusual, but I would also like to thank Ugo Bassi, with whom I have had a very fruitful working relationship during this time, and so the text is also the result of work done within the Commission. As for you, Minister, earlier I felt that you contributed something when, in your thanks, you asked whether we would continue to make progress. So let me begin by thanking you, because without you we would never have achieved anything on the Member States’ side. These are genuine thanks, not simply a polite gesture – I believe that your personal commitment has been key to the progress made in the Council and to the fact that we have reached an agreement. You have also succeeded in ensuring that all the main groups can identify with parts of the text and in obtaining the majority that we both wanted for this directive. My thanks also for the contributions from our fellow Members on the left, without whose support the directive would not have the credibility that I am confident it will have tomorrow after a very broad vote. As you pointed out, this was vital for supervision, and vital for this directive too. I am also very grateful to your teams, Minister; please pass on my thanks. Some of the debates were pretty lively, but although I now live in Normandy, I come from the south, and sometimes my southern temperament wins out over the more balanced Norman approach. I also wanted to say, Minister, President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council, that I really hope that we will complete our work on rating agencies before the end of the year. For our part, we have the committee vote on 22 November, the vote in Strasbourg in December, and then, if the Council is ready, we will be ready. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, in 1968, our fellow Member Mr Cohn-Bendit’s friends wrote, ‘words, not deeds’ on the walls of Paris. Today, citizens are asking for the opposite: deeds, not words. We are hearing a lot of words, but our fellow citizens are not seeing results. The European Union’s slowness to respond is not good enough given the imperatives we need to deal with. We need to move forward together, with a united European spirit. In this respect, I would like to say a word about the role of Parliament. Here too, there is still work to be done in terms of upholding the codecision principle. The President of the Commission thanked Parliament several times for its support, but Parliament is not here simply to play a secondary, support role, or to ratify decisions taken by the Council without having the chance to discuss them first. Parliament is on a par with the Council. It is time we recognised this, and the debate on economic governance will be a test in this respect. Finally, as regards the forthcoming G20 summit, the European Union must present a united front to ensure that this international body plays the role that is expected of it and does not merely indulge in endless talk. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, the Treaty of Lisbon unquestionably provides Europe with new social objectives. Sustainable development in Europe is based on the high competitiveness of the social market economy, which means full employment and social progress, the fight against social exclusion and discrimination, the promotion of justice and the eradication of poverty. The Treaty of Lisbon confirms the role of the social partners and promotes social dialogue between the trade unions and the representatives of employers’ organisations at European level. On these various points, the actual situation is certainly not the one described by some speakers here. Today, we can dramatise the situation; it is true that there are worrying situations, that the crisis is not yet over, and that it has consequences. However, Europe is taking measures in this area – which we must explain to our citizens – to create some order in the financial sector, in particular, and in this regard, it is one of the first to be making efforts to organise that sector, on the basis of our work. Allow me to make a few short remarks. On services of general interest in particular, I will say clearly that we should take specific national circumstances into account, because it is true that some of our fellow citizens are a little alarmed – I am thinking, for example, of the French – when they feel, wrongly, that Europe is endangering the public services which are a French tradition. Likewise, in relation to public contracts, we should take account of individual circumstances, and especially of those which allow for collaboration between several public authorities. Nevertheless, social policy is dependent on the health of the economy and on economic growth. That is the primary objective of a social market economy. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by briefly praising Mr Karas’ excellent work. I was one of the people who were in favour of an own-initiative report being produced before the Commission makes its proposals on the framework for transposing the Basel Agreement, and I am delighted that the work done by Mr Karas with the help of the various shadow rapporteurs has highlighted the main points for consideration. I will not repeat them here, Commissioner, and of course I welcome the points you make and your determination to ensure that this regulatory framework is effective and workable and above all that it creates no distortion of competition at international level. To move on to a different subject, I cannot help noticing that there is often a big difference between the statements that are made publicly and the commitment to these in practice. I also note that countries outside the European Union, and I am thinking of the United States in particular, have an irritating tendency to make value judgments about how we operate, whilst they themselves are not putting the systems into practice as they ought. As regards Basel, it is vital that European companies are dealt with on an equal footing and are not penalised more than US companies. In the United States, few banks are taking notice of these directives or of the Basel Committee and, at present, nothing is actually being put into practice. I would hate to see the provisions adopted in June to regulate US finance – the statements made about these exaggerate their real impact – being used as a legal basis for not applying the provisions which might be introduced by bodies outside the United States. Commissioner, I trust in what I know to be your total determination and vigilance to ensure that this does not lead to a distortion of competition for the French banks, the European banks, and for those who finance the economy in general. It is right that we should be steering the banks back towards their primary role of financing economic development, but we must make sure that they are not penalised disproportionately. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, I recall a few years ago asking the then Competition Commissioner whether she was aware of any evaluation being carried out on the effectiveness for consumers of fines set, and on this matter, the then Commissioner indicated at the beginning of our committee meeting that she had managed to claw back so many million euro in fines. And so the answer was that it had not been considered. It would appear that since then, you have carried out studies to find out what damages were actually incurred. However, I would like to draw your attention to two matters. The first being that prices are fixed on the basis of a group’s turnover. However, the company that may have violated competition rules, and I am not condoning it, may be a relatively small company within the group. That is what bothers me, especially when there are separate legal entities involved. Secondly, Commissioner, and it is you who said so and not your colleague, you often talk about the need for prevention, saying that prevention is better than repression and, in any case, more effective. So the question I ask is whether these huge fines, which always make the front page of the newspapers in which they are delivered, really have any role in terms of prevention. And I wonder whether it might not be more effective in terms of prevention to focus more on the number of checks rather than on the level of fines. As has recently been the case in France, sentences can clearly be passed for sums of money requiring 4 or 5 000 years to be paid off. I think that we should not become fixated on these figures. We need to look specifically at the repercussions for the company, at a time of uncertain economic circumstances. Skewing the rules of competition is not right. It is quite right that a penalty is applied but this penalty needs to be truly proportional, which is why we wanted to know whether or not the Commission would amend its rules. I think you said that this would not be the case, which is a shame. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Mr Van Rompuy, first of all, I would like to say how happy I am to see that, on the question of the Roma, the positions for resolving the problems of poverty faced by these populations are balanced, reasonable and forward-looking. I would like to say to you, Mr Van Rompuy, that I appreciated your way of presenting the achievements of these last eight months. You presented them with vigour and precision. We do not say enough about Europe’s work, and neither do we say enough about the part Parliament plays in it. You spoke just now of collaboration, in particular, as it relates to supervision. This is good, because Parliament wanted agencies with a true European competence, which this supervision was able to introduce, because, as you know, the position of the Ecofin Council in December 2009 was much more reticent on this question. We must continue, at a time when the G20 will have a European Presidency, via France. We must say more, and we must say it stronger, with one voice. We must also have specific proposals for the future. We are counting on you, Mr Van Rompuy. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, I would, of course, like to add to all the congratulations offered and I would like to underline the work done and the excellent collaboration within this Parliament and also to remind you that without the will of Parliament, this supervision would certainly not have had the European characteristics that it has today. As far as the future is concerned, Mr Reynders, before the end of this period and perhaps even before the end of this month, I would like us to be able to reach an agreement on one of the subjects that concerns us to which you have dedicated yourselves, and not in vain I can assure you. In the coming days, thanks to the great minds of the Belgian Presidency, we will find a satisfactory solution on hedge funds and private equity. To repeat one of the Commissioner’s analogies, I think that we must add bricks to this framework that has just been outlined that will ensure that financial regulation is intelligent and affects all products. It is not about regulation for regulation’s sake. It is about trying to ascertain the effectiveness of regulation that is intended to limit as far as possible the risks inherent in the financial system. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Mr Wright who regrettably is leaving us. We hope that after all the work he has done to help Parliament achieve results, we will see him again soon on the European way. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I should naturally like to add my congratulations on the good result obtained in the area of supervision. As Mrs Goulard reminded us, Parliament’s effort has not been in vain, and in December something new and unique happened: a statement was issued by the four coordinators of the main groups saying that Europe needed to play a greater role in this supervision. Thanks to your dynamism, Mr Reynders, a good solution has been found. The Commission has clearly worked hard, and I welcome the financial services programme announced to us by Commissioner Barnier. It is fortunate that this happened, that this agreement was reached, because the EU’s financial credibility, its financial credibility in the eyes of our fellow citizens who, since the crisis have been asking us, ‘What is the EU doing? What concrete results have you achieved?’ is ultimately at stake. We can tell them that we are thinking about and working on this issue, that we are holding trialogues and meetings, but what they want is results. The EU’s credibility in the eyes of our international partners, particularly the US, is also at stake. I have recently been in contact with representatives from the US finance sector and, ultimately, what bothers them about the EU is this impression of legal uncertainty: we change regulations; we introduce revision clauses and sunset clauses; we do not build anything solid. I think that legislation must be definitive, albeit subject to amendment. We must not, above all else, give the impression that we are going to amend the texts two or three years down the road. Madam President, Mr Reynders, I should like to plead on my behalf: a very important trialogue will take place this afternoon with Commissioner Barnier and my colleagues on the regulation of hedge funds. It is essential that we find a solution soon. I am very conscious of the commitment on the part of the Belgian Presidency and of your personal commitment. We must reach an agreement over the next few weeks, so that next time you report on ECOFIN’s work, you will be able to say, ‘An agreement has been reached on the regulation of hedge funds.’ We are counting on this, and I know that you also are counting on it. We must now take the final step so that the right solution can be found. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, credit rating agencies were a matter of concern to this Parliament at the end of its previous term, and I should like to highlight in this regard the responsiveness of both the Commission and Parliament, which has adopted a regulation on credit rating agencies. Today, we are raising this issue once again because of the observations that it has been possible to make about the role of credit rating agencies during the crisis. They can be criticised for not having seen the crisis coming, they can be criticised for the volatility of their ratings and for their untimely decisions in announcing their ratings, especially when they relate to sovereign debt. Nevertheless, I believe that we must examine this issue with a clear head. Firstly, the fact that credit rating agencies rate products that they have submitted to investors is not, in itself, shocking. Investors who invest, who provide funds, are entitled to try to discover the risks or the difficulties that may arise, just as they are entitled to try to discover which ratings are good. Where the situation becomes slightly more ambiguous is when these ratings are used, in banking regulations, to determine the amounts of own funds that banks must have in exchange for some of their investments. From this point of view, the 2009 regulation does not really provide a solution since the idea was to provide for both the approval and the supervision of credit rating agencies. Therefore, a rating may be legitimate, but is it legitimate to issue ratings as the agencies do? I believe that the texts that you will propose – I would emphasise, Commissioner, that you have just submitted the text on the introduction of European supervision of credit rating agencies within the framework of the new financial regulation – must enable a solution to be found to these issues, especially that of competition in the field of credit rating agencies. From my perspective, I do not think that simply confirming the creation of a European agency, even if it is public, solves the problems. If the idea is to have an agency that issues ratings in a kinder, more generous fashion than the others, it will not be of much use. More questions need to be asked, in my opinion, about the conditions in which the agencies issue their ratings. There are ratings of private enterprises, and there are ratings of sovereign debt. I shall emphasise the ratings of sovereign debt. The authority which, at Parliament’s request, will be responsible for monitoring and supervising those agencies that will operate in Europe is ESMA, the new financial services authority. I also think that the powers conferred on ESMA should include the possibility not only to supervise the agencies effectively, but also, as regards sovereign debt, to provide for a facility by which to monitor, though not censure, the way in which credit rating agencies issue sovereign debt ratings. We cannot allow a situation – and such situations have indeed arisen – in which, 15 minutes before the markets close, an agency downgrades a country, thus giving rise to completely undesirable consequences. In fact, what needs to be done is to implement a preventive system that will force credit rating agencies to inform the supervisor, within a very short timescale, if need be, of the conditions in which they envisage issuing ratings so that the supervisor can verify both that the standard procedures have been followed and, above all, that the conditions in which the ratings are issued will not adversely affect the situation as regards, in particular, sovereign debt. The debt of businesses is not the same as that of states; it deserves to be treated differently. That being said, some people have mentioned the Court of Auditors, but such courts do not exist in every European country, and they are not all independent. That, Mr President, Commissioner, is the thrust of our questions. How can we improve the operating methods of credit rating agencies and, above all, the dissemination of information, and how can we improve competition? Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial situation in Europe fully justifies the drastic measures which have been taken, in particular, to stabilise the euro area and to avoid the undermining of our single currency. The urgency of the situation justifies the practical approach adopted. However, when it comes to implementing the adopted measures, it should be ensured that Parliament is involved, within the scope of its powers, and can exert its democratic control in appropriate conditions. Indeed, we must ensure that our fellow citizens do not lose confidence, and can regain confidence, in the political institutions. Without such confidence, no structural reform or acceptance of the necessary austerity measures will be possible. Faced with the financial crisis, Europe has not been inactive. We do not say this often enough. In 2009, we drew up and adopted regulations on the credit rating agencies, the implementing provisions of which will be published very shortly by the Commission. Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted a few days ago for the package on the supervision of financial activities. Last Monday, the same committee adopted the report on regulation of hedge fund managers by a large majority. Trialogues have been initiated to seek an agreement with the Council. This agreement must be obtained rapidly, so that our institutions retain their credibility. Our fellow citizens often ask us: ‘What is Europe doing?’ We must meet their expectations. In this regard, I should like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on your determination, and to encourage you to continue with the work programme which you have set out, in accordance with the undertakings made at your hearing. Your ambitious but essential timetable has our support. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with you so that the necessary regulation of financial services takes place. This is not a question of bullying the finance sector, but of establishing the rules to ensure that an activity which should be regulated is regulated, and of making transactions more secure and transparent. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis we are experiencing has forced public authorities to intervene financially using public money. Under these circumstances, it is tempting to consider the implementation of a tax on financial transactions. The income from this tax would be used, for example, to finance the recovery and to develop a sustainable economy, and could initially serve to offset the cost of the crisis borne by the real economy and the taxpayer. This tax would be added to the regulations governing the financial sector, the elimination of tax havens or even the regulations currently being drawn up for derivative products. At this stage, it would be advisable to evaluate the effects of a tax on financial transactions. That is the main purpose of this oral question: to encourage the Commission to examine in practical terms the various points listed in the draft resolution in order to give an opinion on the feasibility and timeliness of such a tax. Commissioner, what you have just said is a step in the right direction. It should, however, be stressed – as you have done – that this measure will have to be approached in a realistic and pragmatic way. Such a tax must not be harmful to the European economy or to the competitiveness of the European financial industry. More generally, it is important to underline the consequences of implementing this tax in the European Union alone, as some people are advocating, if no agreement were possible at international level. We believe that this sort of purely European solution cannot be countenanced. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I do not doubt your determination, and you have, in the points that you have just covered, already answered most of the questions we were going to ask and that are raised by this resolution. I will simply remind you that the difficulty of the subject stems from the fact that the single euro payments area (SEPA) is an initiative of payment institutions, particularly banks. Also, may I say that the purpose of the directive on payment services, for which I had the honour of being rapporteur, was specifically designed to enable us to identify and define the legal instruments needed in order to put this European payments system in place. Another purpose of the directive was to improve competition in the area of payments, and Title II made provision for the creation of payment institutions, which were intended to break the monopoly of the banks. This complicated beginning certainly explains part of the delay, but it is certainly also true, as you have said, that payment services establishments – that is, banks – have demonstrated a certain reluctance to implement this mechanism. There is an explanation: the cost. I am sure you already know this, but to give you an idea: in France, for example, the cost of implementing SEPA is higher than that of changing to the euro. There has also been the matter of interchange fees, which deserves to be tackled. There are two issues involved. The first, as you mentioned, is that of conformity to the rules of competition, but the second issue, which must not be neglected, is that the payment service is a commercial activity for payment institutions which must, therefore, be fairly remunerated. What has been condemned is the possibility of setting interbank margins unilaterally, arbitrarily and without consultation, when these rightly appear excessive. Commissioner, we are counting on you to ensure that the progress we have made with the creation of a single-payments market can result in the swift implementation of European tools for transfers and direct debits. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).  
– (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with many of the arguments put forward by Mrs Thyssen, Mr Karas and Mrs Castex. Nevertheless, I ask myself the following question: following the compromise that we have managed to reach, allowing national options to survive, must we block this directive which constitutes a positive sign of simplification for micro-entities? If I may, Commissioner, I would like to make a non-committal proposal. First of all, I would suggest that Parliament must support Mr Lehne’s proposal and that you take into account what has just been said about modifying other directives. In that way, we will very quickly reach agreement: accounting rules for small businesses, and a European system in that area. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, President, Commissioner, like Mrs Wortmann-Kool before me, I am, of course, going to tell you that we approve of the positions adopted by the Commission to deal with the current situation in Greece. As regards the Spanish Presidency, we are pleased to note the objective that you are setting yourself to improve the coordination of economic policies. This strong political will must also be applied in order to see through two current and important projects: the structuring of a genuine form of financial supervision and the regulation of hedge funds. True, Europe must not be a fortress, but nor must it be a sieve. In both these areas, the Presidency really must have room to manoeuvre so that it can negotiate productively with Parliament. We expect the Council, at its next meeting, to send out a strong signal to the public and to the market: to the public to restore confidence in the euro, and to the market to show its solidarity with Greece. The Council must give a strong indication that it will not let itself be overawed by the attempts to destabilise the euro made by certain speculators who have no hesitation in speculating against those Member States that are currently facing economic and social difficulties. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the commissioner’s comments just now genuinely answer the question that was asked. The European Union does not make funds available without conditions. Those conditions have been mentioned: quality of public spending, sustainable development objectives, employment policy, climate change, but also, of course, the need to make up for the shortfalls of the previous administration as quickly as possible, so that these countries that we are helping can reach the level required. However, in a crisis such as the one we are going through, I believe that we must not go overboard with conditions. We must trust the governments of the Member States that receive European aid to implement the necessary provisions and avoid, as the commissioner said, provisions that could be retrograde or backward-looking. Social spending is, of course, important – it must be preserved – but here, too, we must trust the Member States to adopt the measures needed to rectify the situation and not carry out nit-picking checks, which would be ineffective anyway. The time to assess the way in which the Member States have used European aid will be when any new aid is granted, and it is then that we will perhaps be able to draw conclusions from measures that were unsuitable, particularly in the social sphere. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome your determination. Europe has begun to put in place effective regulation, but Europe must not find itself isolated. Close international cooperation is necessary, and this is exactly what we expect of the G20. It must pursue the reforms, which were initiated at previous meetings, with rigour and vigour. The international framework for regulating the financial sector must be completed, so that it can aid investment, growth and employment. Guiding principles must be affirmed. The crisis is not over. We must not return to the situation ex ante and abandon measures needed to avoid, as far as possible, the renewal of crises which are particularly damaging to the real economy, growth and employment. The strengthening of supervision and regulation is equally necessary. The obligations for supervision should reflect the level of systematic risk that the financial institutions impose on this sector. Speculative activities, which represent a significant risk, should be discouraged by increasing the capital requirements and applying the Basel rules internationally. As for salaries in the financial sector, we should recommend pay committees, increase transparency of these salaries with stricter disclosure requirements and supervise variable salaries, notably bonuses. The strengthening of global financial institutions is likewise an imperative, as is the reform of governance and representation at the IMF. Commissioner, these are some of the expectations citizens have of the next G20, where Europe must speak with one voice, with determination and conviction. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

) Madam President, President of the Court of Auditors, I would like to start by thanking you and all of the members of the Court – including Ms Kaljulaid, who is here with you – for the work you do and in particular for the attention you pay to Members of the European Parliament. You pay us a great deal of attention and I really wanted to thank you for that. I would also like to thank Commissioner Šemeta, who, following on from the remarkable work of his predecessor, continues to improve the auditing of our accounts and the quality of special reports. I would like to apologise on behalf of my colleague, Bogusław Sonik, who has been detained by other parliamentary commitments. I too regret the absence of the Council, which is the budgetary authority. Mr President, this report comes too late. That is not your fault. I tabled amendments to the Financial Regulation to change the timetable. The European Commission must present the accounts before 31 March each year, the Court must publish its report before 30 June, and Parliament must vote before 31 December. It is inconceivable that today, in November, we should still be talking about matters concerning 2011. I suggest that the working group that I have proposed should meet to change this timetable. I would like to make a few observations: Article 323 of the Treaty suggests that Parliament should ensure that the necessary financial means are made available to the European Union. I wonder if the Court could not play a role in raising the alarm about the Union’s cash position: we have learned that we had a shortfall of EUR 9 billion and we are incapable of paying our bills. I would therefore suggest that the Court can help us to monitor the functioning of the Union. A final word about shared management: I think that we need to take another look at it here. I wonder about the independence of the audit authorities and about relations with our national audit institutions, and I think that the shared management system – which has proved useful in its time – should be re-examined. I wonder if we should not create our own finance function at Union level and get rid of this system of shared management, which contains a lot of errors, is very expensive and the efficiency of which merits re-examination.

 Firstly, I regret that the President of the European Council did not attend the debate. The crisis has caught up with the debate on the European budget. We argue: that is normal. However, we need an agreement; otherwise, we will be the laughing stock of the international community. Yes, we must support the European Commission’s excellent proposals. At the same, however, we cannot ignore the financial difficulties that many Member States are experiencing. In this context, I have a suggestion to make: we should maintain the overall multiannual ceiling proposed by the Commission and establish two separate periods. The first would last three years and we would agree to freeze appropriations to give the Member States time to put their finances in order and ratify the Treaty on Stability. During the second period, from 2017 to 2020, we would increase the budget slightly to reach the amount proposed by the Commission, and this would be financed, in particular, by the own resources established in the meantime. In 2014 we will have a new European Parliament, a new Commission and a new President of the European Council. In 2015 the United Kingdom might leave the Union. We could have a political debate on all of these matters when we come to the 2014 European elections. Jean-Pierre Audy,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control

Mr President, Commissioner, my first words will be to give apologies on behalf of Ms Ivanova, detained by other Parliamentary activities, who has entrusted me with summarising for you the report of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Our committee recognises that financial instruments are useful in creating multiplier effects and leverage effects, such as guarantees and tolls. However, we draw your attention to the recommendations of the Court of Auditors and its 2010 opinion on ownership of instruments, risk-taking, accounting, transparency and reinforcement of EU staff capacity to operate them. The second point concerns links with financial markets. We think that these instruments should only be used when there is no offer from the private sector, so as to avoid any distortion in financial markets. Lastly, speaking personally, I am sorry that the idea of introducing an obligatory user contribution was not explored, in particular for trans-European transport networks that need financing, particularly those are not immediately profitable.

Mr President, I want to say something about the interpretation of Rule 191 of the Rules of Procedure. As there has been no announcement, I gather that there has been no opposition to that interpretation. For the sake of democracy in our Parliament, I wanted to be sure that it had no retroactive effect, that it did not affect the current mandates and political agreements within the committees, and that this rule would apply to the renewal of future mandates in the parliamentary committees concerned. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we must reach an agreement if we do not want to be the laughing stock of the international community over what, unfortunately, remains a small budget. That agreement is difficult to reach, however. I would like to emphasise the need to establish a review clause for 2017. By 2017 the Member States will have had time to ratify the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance. The issue of public finances will be resolved, as will the issue of sovereign debt. In 2017 we will have a new Parliament, a new Commission and a new President of the European Council. Consequently, if we do not reach an agreement, let us open a political debate on all of the issues. In this regard, I would like to emphasise this review clause, which, in the context of this political debate, will allow us to set out perspectives that correspond to the European ambitions to which we all aspire. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I want to make a point of procedure to the members of the Conference of Presidents under your authority, Mr President. I regret that we did not have a political debate to prepare for this European Council with the General Affairs Council. I would suggest, and I hope you agree, President-in-Office of the Council, that you should come and prepare for the European Councils with us so that you can hear the political debates in this House. I was disappointed in this European Council: very little was said about growth; practically nothing on competitiveness; no proposals on a major infrastructure investment plan. Indeed, all we heard about it in the press was that agreement had been reached on the timetable for the banking union. When it comes to the proposals concerning the contractual relations between the Member States and the European Union, like some other speakers, I have a hard time believing them. Take the national reform programmes: France, under Mr Fillon’s Government, put forward proposals that were accepted at the June European Council, with the new President of the Republic. Where are the recommendations for each Member State? France had proposed reducing public spending, and reforming pensions and the labour market. I think that we need to monitor these country-specific recommendations. However, we can tighten contractual relations through convergence on social aspects; Article 155 of the Treaty provides for this. We must ensure convergence of minimum wages. The former communist countries have been members of the European Union for eight years. We must factor convergence of minimum wages into the price chain. As you said, President-in-Office of the Council, we need to restore confidence. We need to use politics to restore the confidence of the people. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, I should like to speak about those paragraphs which refer to Parliament’s organisation and its seat. Paragraph 86 [sic
: 87] states that Parliament believes that, like every directly elected parliament, the European Parliament should have the right to decide on its own seat. This statement is an error, Mr President, and I should like to request that, in accordance with the appropriate procedures, this error should be removed. Admittedly, the German Parliament, the Bundestag, decided, on its own account, to transfer its seat from Bonn to Berlin, but constitutional and political practices differ widely from one Member State to another. In the Member State to which I belong, the seats of the National Assembly and the Senate are determined by statute. Then there are the paragraphs which call for studies regarding the savings to be made. From the carbon-footprint point of view, a seat in Strasbourg is exactly the same as a seat in Brussels. As for savings, I believe that it is necessary to include a study of all EU seats: the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, the European Medicines Agency in London, the European Banking Authority in London, the European Patent Office in Munich, etc. If we are going to carry out a study, let us do it covering all the seats of the European Union rather than, as it were, deliberately singling out the European Parliament. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to express my regret at the absence of the Heads of State or Government. That is nothing against you, Minister for European Affairs, but there is no Head of State here, not even their representative, President Van Rompuy. Where is Baroness Ashton, attending the European Council meeting? Yes, we need a federation of nation States in the long term, Mr Barroso, and we support you on this matter. However, we must not forget a Europe of results. Above all else, we need a Europe of results. We need to keep an eye on our banks, our major infrastructure, on budget cuts, diplomacy and defence. I should like to draw your attention to social convergence. Look at the former communist countries. It is not eight days that they have been members of the European Union, but eight years. The minimum wage is EUR 200. We should be ashamed. We have the necessary legal bases – Articles 154 and 155 of the Treaty – and therefore wage increases should be achievable through social negotiation. Yes, we need to move towards a federation of nation states. However, we need less haste and more speed. If we were to hold 27 referendums, 25 or 26 of them would say ‘no’. Do not rush us; we will not move towards a political Europe without democracy. And we must consider the suffering of the people. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for all the competence, patience and vision that you have employed in performing your duties. I should like to make some observations on your proposals. Firstly, I am surprised that the Council is not here, because it is the Council which really should have presented this proposal to us. It is in charge of this matter and not the Commission. It is up to the Council to make this proposal for a specific mission of the Central Bank relating to prudential supervision. I agree with some of my fellow Members: this legal basis does indeed have the merit of being efficient, but I do not think it meets our fellow citizens’ expectations, as they wanted regulation at European level. Furthermore, I am puzzled about Article 15 of the proposal, which lays down sanctions, while the legal basis, namely Article 127(6), only provides for prudential supervision. We are told that managers will be removed or fines imposed of up to 10% of turnover. I believe that we should have this point checked. I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, for approximately the last four years, the Committee on Budgetary Control has, under this legal basis, been calling for regulatory supervision of the European Investment Bank, and it would be worthwhile for this regulation to extend to cover public banks, and particularly public development banks. Finally, I believe that, under Article 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, we could consider introducing a European policy on regulators, for, under this Article, the Union is entitled to adopt any measure it needs to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market – regulators for credit institutions, and also for insurance, which is not provided for under Article 127(6), and for energy and digital technology. In short, we must introduce a genuine regulatory policy for our European markets if we wish to achieve a genuine internal market. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Commissioner, finally, we have a European Council on growth. I am sorry that in December 2011, when the Heads of State or Government agreed on the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, the President of the European Council did not call a specific Council to look at growth, but we have got there in the end. I think that we need to call formally on the 25 states to ratify this Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which sends out a message of confidence and solidarity, in terms of both the markets and the people. I appeal to the political powers in France to honour the signature of the French Republic without delay. We have talked about growth, but I think that we also need to talk about competitiveness. We need to talk about the competitiveness of our continent: yes, we need a major infrastructure plan. We do not need EUR 10 or 20 billion; we need investments of between EUR 1 000 and 1 500 billion. We lack imagination when it comes to own resources. Why not establish compulsory contributions for digital measures, energy networks, roads, railways and water? I am proposing once again that we carry out an audit of public spending and pool military, diplomatic and research spending. Finally, on an institutional level, I was pleased that our Chair, Mr Daul, reiterated the suggestion that the President of the European Parliament be invited to the European Council. However, Mr President, the President of the European Council himself needs to establish a relationship with our Parliament. Since the establishment of a permanent presidency, we have had no contact with the Heads of State or Government. We need political dialogue at the very highest level with the Heads of State or Government and with Mr Van Rompuy, who is absent from this House far too often. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Madam President, this is a point of order under Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union.

 Mr President, as part of these discussions on Venezuela’s decision to withdraw from an inter-American human rights organisation, I would like to draw Parliament’s attention to the fact that very important trade negotiations are currently under way between two trade blocks, the European Union and Mercosur, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, and that Venezuela is a candidate for accession to Mercosur. That might appear a little irrelevant, but I believe that we, ourselves, cannot work with areas which do not respect a body of rules of law. We are clearly not going to interfere in the procedures for States to become members of Mercosur, in the same way that Mercosur has no right to intervene to decide whether Croatia joins the European Union or not. Nevertheless, in the negotiations between these two blocks, I feel that the European Union and South America should share in a common destiny. It would therefore be a very bad signal if Venezuela did not respect human rights, and that is an issue that this Inter-American Commission is meant to monitor. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

) Mr President, Minister, Commissioners, I will never get used to European Councils being prepared by the General Affairs Council, and I am disappointed that Mr Van Rompuy has not come to debrief us at this meeting, even if it is informal. Actually, Minister, the problem at hand does not come under the authority of the rotating Presidency. Since there has been a permanent Presidency, we at the European Parliament no longer have any contact with Heads of State or Government. We are facing a problem which falls to the European Council and Heads of State or Government. I regret that we have no dealings with Mr Van Rompuy because the truth is that the Council convened tomorrow and one at the end of June is intended to close the European Semester. This is not exactly the European Council on growth that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) asked for as far back as early December last year. A few thoughts on the matter: firstly, we are no longer listening to advocates of zero growth. This is good news. Next, I reiterate the idea that we should examine the effectiveness of public spending. I propose an independent audit, conducted by the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors, to find out where we could make savings: 27 armies, yet no enemies, research programmes that have been funded 15 times without any coordination, hundreds of diplomatic buildings where the costs are not even shared. The second point of thought is competitiveness. A word that is not used enough. Firstly, the competitiveness of our companies (flexicurity, labour costs) – and this does not mean public spending and higher levies as proposed by Mr Hollande to resolve the problems of competitiveness that we face in Europe and France. Next, the competitiveness of the continent. Yes, we need a major infrastructure plan for roads, digital technology, space and universities. Finally, for struggling States, I suggest, in line with Jean-Paul Gauzès’ proposals, that we consider establishing hive-off vehicles, beyond ratios, with a banking licence, in other words, access to the European Central Banks (ECB)’s cash to help States recover. However, each State needs to pay off its debts. We are never going to get a political majority whereby the people of one State pay off another State’s debts. Each State needs to pay off its own debts. Lastly, Mr President, the speech on the State of the Union is woefully inadequate. I propose organising a Congress of the Union in the autumn, which would bring together Heads of State or Government, the European Commission, the European Parliament and national parliaments to ensure that the direction of the continent is in the interests of the European people.

 Mr Hoang Ngoc, you are talking about taxes and collecting taxes. I am talking about public spending. The experts tell us that, in terms of public spending at each of the three levels, in other words, European, national and regional level, which includes local authorities, if we were to take a close look at our public spending, without touching upon the issue of sovereignty, if we were just to look at how we can make improvements to pool our expenditure, we could save billions and billions and billions, which could be used to reduce debts and to make investments. I am not talking about taxes; I am talking about making savings in public spending. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, the Heads of State or Government are meeting in an informal Council. It was customary for the President of the Council to come and report on the Councils, even when they were informal. However, I believe you will take the floor at 19.00 – I also hope that they will let you stay for dinner so that the President of Parliament can stay at the Council – but has the President of the Council been invited?

 On the basis of the report by Portuguese MEP Vital Moreira, I voted for the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the 2009 regulation on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. On 28 July 2011, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) adopted the Appellate Body Report in the case ‘European Communities – Definitive Anti-Dumping Measures on Certain Iron or Steel Fasteners from China’. In the reports, it was found, inter alia
, that Article 9.5 of the Council Regulation of November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community was inconsistent with WTO rules. This legislative proposal aims to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings. I hope that the Commission and the Committee on International Trade have indeed respected the principle of reciprocity. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

I voted in favour of discharge to the Commission on the basis of the report by my excellent colleague, Christofer Fjellner, who has accomplished an immense task in difficult conditions. I do not understand why the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors do not work together enough. With regard to the consolidated accounts, it is not normal to present them with negative equity and not include the EU’s ownership over the Members States in terms of staff pensions, the debt for which is, moreover, provisioned as a liability.

 I did not vote for the proposal to postpone discharge to the Council proposed by the report of my Spanish colleague, Inés Ayala Sender. By mistake, I did not vote for discharge in the Committee on Budgetary Control. As last year, my intention was to do so. I note that the European Court of Auditors did not comment on the management of the Council. I am also disappointed that my proposal for a legal study of the power of the European Parliament to grant discharge to the Council was rejected. That would have identified, in particular, the consequences for discharge of the creation of the European Union as a legal entity by the Treaty of Lisbon. I think these debates between the Council, which thinks that, unlike the other EU institutions, it is not responsible for the use of the funds made available to it, and the statement that granting discharge to the Commission equates to granting discharge for the entire EU budget, including the parts of the budget used by the Council, are derisory. All these debates do not reflect well on the Committee on Budgetary Control. I hope things will quickly become clear. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, my first words will be to congratulate Ms Ticău on the tremendous work she has done in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on this eGovernment dossier. I would like to thank the Commission for its work. I should like to make three comments. First, we need assurance that we have the coverage that will enable us to use all these new technologies across the entire European continent. This is an important factor for the competitiveness of our continent. In the canton of Meymac, in Corrèze, of which I am the elected representative, and also in Limousin and Auvergne, not all of our territory is covered, and this is a real problem. We need to achieve 100% coverage within the European Union and the Member States. Secondly, government must not, under the guise of making life easier, become more complex. We, the citizens, are tired of excessive complexity and bureaucracy. Finally, I would like to make a comment concerning the siting of officials. These new technologies must enable officials to stay where they are and give them the possibility of teleworking with their central administration, thanks precisely to eGovernment.

 Considerable work has been carried out in the area of financial stability – congratulations! However, it is incomprehensible for Spain or Italy to borrow from the banks at 6% while the banks borrow from the European Central Bank at 1%. I propose that we create, within each Member State of the euro area, special purpose defeasance entities, with a banking license to manage bad debt that exceeds the ratios authorised by the Stability and Growth Pact. I propose a political debate between national parliaments and the European Parliament on savings to be made in public expenditure (e.g. armies, diplomatic buildings, research programmes) at three levels – national, European and regional – based on an independent audit which could be conducted by the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors. I reiterate the idea of a major investment plan of EUR 1 000 – 1 500 billion over the EU 2020 period and the creation of an investment section in the European budget. Finally, I regret that President Van Rompuy did not attend this debate, as there is an increasingly urgent need to convene a European Council meeting with only one item on the agenda – growth.

Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday at 06.46, Strasbourg time, time stopped in Japan. In a joint prayer, the Japanese people turned their thoughts to those killed or injured by the natural disaster together with the serious nuclear incident at the Fukushima power plant. One year earlier, on 11 March at the same time, 06.46, an earthquake of 8.9 on the Richter scale caused the loss of the plant’s electricity supply. The reactors shut down and the emergency generators went into operation. Unfortunately, 55 minutes later, 14-metre high waves devastated the plant: 19 000 dead, 340 000 displaced persons, an earthquake and a tsunami produced the greatest nuclear disaster in the world. Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) I would like to thank you for your initiative and to say that the dignity and courage of the Japanese people, their government and the families affected are in our thoughts. We are thinking of them. This disaster led to a political debate, as you have pointed out, involving all sectors of the public. In the heat of the moment, some states decided either to shut down nuclear power plants immediately or to gradually phase them out. However, worldwide there are more nuclear plants being constructed than the number shut down, and so the issue is a topical one. Moreover, this disaster is just one in the list of increasingly frequent disasters worldwide. Who could forget the earthquake in Haiti or the Deepwater oil disaster? Commissioner, the European Union reacted immediately, and I would like to thank your colleague, Mr Oettinger. After the disaster on 11 March, the European Council met immediately, on 24 and 25 March 2011, and called for a comprehensive evaluation of the safety risks of nuclear power for all the plants in the European Union. The European Commission was asked to review the June 2009 directive on nuclear safety, and the programme was thus set up. Today, all the Member States have carried out their evaluations; we await a peer review and the European Council in June 2012 will make an overall assessment. The PPE Group would like thinking to focus on the following areas for improvement. Firstly, with regard to safety standards, the European Union and its citizens must be assured that we have the best safety standards in the world. We know that these safety standards develop in line with scientific expertise and that they must be continually amended and made binding upon operators in the sector. Secondly, governance must be reviewed so as to give greater independence to the national safety authorities. My third point relates to transparency. In this sector, transparency must be beyond reproach. All national safety authorities must make their documents public to ensure that their citizens are properly informed. Fourthly, we must review development and the technical criteria relating to the selection of sites where nuclear power plants are located. Fifthly, we must jointly improve emergency preparedness and response. I would like to remind Members of the proposal to create a European civil protection force. Sixthly, operators’ civil liability needs to be clarified. We must include all the costs of nuclear power within cost prices, including possible risks and the costs of decommissioning power plants, either through suitable insurance, or through own capital requirements. Seventhly, the full costs should be included – sorry, I just said that, in relation to risks and decommissioning. Eighthly, I would like to mention scientific training and research. On this point, I welcome the Commission’s proposals to extend the Euratom research programme by two years. Worldwide, we will not be able to resolve our problems concerning energy and competitiveness, maintaining our lifestyle while tackling global warming, without addressing all these issues, which are necessary for the operation of nuclear power plants throughout the world and, in particular, for maximum safety.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Šefčovič, I am having trouble getting used to the fact that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, it is the General Affairs Council that prepares the European Council meetings and it is you, Mr President, who wishes to participate in the European Council. I propose that President Van Rompuy be invited to prepare European Council meetings. I would like to discuss three ideas, primarily with regard to making savings, but specifically savings in the sense of avoiding public spending. I propose that we consider pooling the resources of the European Union and the Member States, starting, for example, with an audit by the European Court of Auditors, in partnership with our 27 national courts of auditors, on the savings we could make. Twenty-seven armies, more enemies, research programmes financed 15 times over without coordination and hundreds of diplomatic buildings for which we could guarantee management for 10 years. Finally, for growth, we should return to this idea of a major investment of EUR 1 000 to 1 500 billion in the Europe 2020 strategy. I also think we are not working enough on social convergence, with minimum wages that are not progressing. What hope do our people have if we fail to factor into the price chain a return to social convergence? Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, President of the Commission, let us start by talking about economic and financial subjects; you have stated, Prime Minister, that Denmark did not envisage being involved in the economic integration of the euro area. Could you reassure us of the swift implementation of legislative proposals on derivatives and the two regulations which must accompany the overhaul of the Stability and Growth Pact? We really do need these texts. Majorities – particularly a political majority – are forming on the tax on financial transactions; could you give us your exact political position on this matter? Next, I should like to draw your attention to trade policy. It is the Council that gives the Commission the mandate to negotiate on the Union’s behalf. It is a competence of the Union, and we, the European Parliament, have a new political competence to approve treaties on trade. I should like to draw your attention to the need to avoid being naïve and the need to apply the principle of reciprocity; for example, will proposals on negotiations with Mercosur be exchanged at the end of your Presidency? I would advise you to be very careful. Finally, with regard to growth, when President Van Rompuy came to tell us about the last European Council, I proposed holding a special European Council entirely dedicated to growth. You are a Member of the European Council, with a special position. President Schulz wishes to be invited to the European Council; will you support us on the presence of our President at the European Council and on the need to have a true European Council dedicated entirely to growth? I wanted to talk about social convergence but my speaking time has run out. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution of 14 December 2011 on the impact of the financial crisis on the defence sector in the EU Member States. I am committed to defending the notion that a common research policy can, and must, be an essential component in building an industrial base for defence. In the absence of a common European industrial defence policy, the defence market has become very fragmented in terms of demand, supply, regulations and standards. I am pleased that, at my behest, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, having been asked for its opinion on this report, took the view that a European industrial defence policy would be valuable in reinforcing the European Union’s role on the world stage and maintaining Europe’s technological capacity, while also taking into account the specificities in each Member State. Cross-border and transatlantic industrial cooperation can facilitate access to new technologies, promote advanced product development and encourage the adoption of effective measures to reduce costs. The financial crisis means that it is not viable to build a European defence industry at a national level. I welcome the work done by Mr Danjean, as Chair of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence.

 I voted in favour of the resolution of the European Parliament of 14 December 2011 on the next EU-Russia Summit. I regret the fact that my proposal of January 2011 to invite the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, to speak at a formal sitting of the European Parliament, which was accepted by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), was turned down by the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament. The Russian Federation is an important neighbour. Five Member States of the European Union share a border with it. Between Europe and Russia, there have been centuries of relations marked by remarkable successes, but also immense suffering. Our common history is indisputable. It derives from the evolution of our respective peoples, the rise and fall of empires, the links between the royal families, culture, the arts, writers, religions, especially Christianity, military combat against fascism, positioning in respect of communism, and so on. Today, Russia has been overtaken by the success of China and is rediscovering its Western roots. It is and will be the essential link in the dialogue between the West and the East, which will serve as a basis for political negotiations aimed at establishing future global governance.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, I should like to begin by saying a few words about currencies. The 19th century was dominated by the pound sterling, the 20th century by the dollar; in the 21st century, we have no idea how currencies will be organised. This was one of the issues tabled by the President of the G20. We have a duty to manage our currency. Traditionally, we had one currency per State. We are experimenting with a currency for a region, a supranational currency. The creation of this economic area of 26 States is good news, Presidents and Heads of State or Government. Hungary has changed its mind, and Denmark is uniting with the euro area even though it was not obliged to do so. This is good news! The United Kingdom is a major European country. We know why it has not joined the euro area: because of its financial services industry, as you said, Mr President. It is also because, in reality, it does not want the financial transaction tax, on which a political consensus is in the process of being reached. The second piece of good news concerns financial stability. All of our great democracies, with the exception of Greece, which is a special case – the conclusions say as much – have changed their government, have taken serious measures in relation to financial governance. We are putting plans in place to ensure the financial stability of our continent. This is good news. I do not believe in such a thing as contagion. We have to consolidate the golden rules and reform our Stability and Growth Pact. There are two issues that have not been resolved. The first is growth. Mr President, I believe the time has come to hold a special European Council in order to examine growth conditions and the terms of a major European investment plan. The second issue concerns the huge disappointment of democrats. Contrary to what was written in Ms Merkel and President Sarkozy’s letter, there has been no mention whatsoever of a parliamentary dimension. The Heads of State or Governments’ failure to add a parliamentary dimension to economic governance is plain wrong! I suggest you do something about it.

 Mr President, I share your point of view. I did not understand the question, but I think that we are in agreement, Mr Koumoutsakos. I think that the issue to be dealt with concerns the broad guidelines on growth set by the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States. That is why I would reiterate my proposal: a future European Council should set broad guidelines on growth. In truth, we know what the two broad guidelines are. The first, as the Commission President mentioned, is a major plan for investing in infrastructure via project bonds. The second is an internal market that can be more than 27 national markets, with flexicurity, and in which we will find the one or two growth points that we need, both to pay off our debts and to finance social progress with the economic prosperity we will create.

 Mr President, we are in the process of holding consultations on the nominations of the Members of the Court of Auditors. I would remind you that the Court of Auditors of the European Union is composed of 27 Members. Under Article 286 of the Treaty, the Members shall be appointed by the Council after it has consulted Parliament. Today, we are holding a consultation, which will be referred to the Council. Therefore, the governments are the ones that propose candidates, and the European Parliament provides an opinion. There is a total of eight candidates, proposed by eight States: Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Sweden. Four of those States – Belgium, Italy, Denmark and Spain – have recently seen a change of government. Two States – Denmark and Spain – with elections, and two – Belgium and Italy – without. In one of those four States, the Kingdom of Spain, the political forces have changed – I was at the summit of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in Marseille – whereas the other three States have made no demands. On the subject of Spain, the Spanish political forces have asked me to request that Parliament postpone the vote – as is possible under Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure – in order to give them time to assess the situation. The King of Spain is due to appoint the government next week. The request being put to our Parliament is to postpone the vote, and it has come from the PPE Group, Mr President. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 I voted in favour of revising the multiannual financial framework to address additional financing needs of the ITER project. The figure stands at EUR 1.3 billion. My first words will be to commend the huge effort made by Alain Lamassoure, Chair of the Committee on Budgets, to gather everyone’s views while emphasising the European interest and that of the European people. Like the generations before us, we know that we will overcome the challenges we face by drawing on mankind’s scientific expertise. This is the case where energy is concerned. Furthermore, there was an urgent need to send a message to our international partners on this remarkable project telling them that we can deliver on our commitments. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to congratulate the rapporteur, my friend Jean Březina, on his excellent work. The European Council meeting of 4 February 2011, known as the EU ‘Energy’ Council, adopted an ambitious European energy policy, intended to assure the people of Europe that they would have safe, sustainable energy at the best price, whose supply would be guaranteed and which would contribute to Europe’s competitiveness. This policy, born out of the Europe 2020 strategy, provides for investment in the development of low-carbon technologies. Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are included in these energy technologies that we Europeans must maintain, develop and implement. We must do so all the more since we are the undisputed and world-recognised leaders in this field thanks to our businesses, our universities, our engineers, our specialist workers and our research centres. I should like Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, to congratulate the European Commission, for having quickly tabled this proposal on 7 March 2011, before the tragedy at Fukushima. I should like to support this proposal for five reasons. First, it aligns the schedules for research programmes with the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013. Second, it stresses safety, which is an essential component of the confidence that the operators of this form of energy have a duty to provide to our fellow citizens. We are pleased that the Union can continue to invest in the area of safety, which is evolving with advances in science and the expectations of our fellow citizens. Third, this proposal allows us to maintain our status as world leaders in the nuclear sciences. Fourth, we are supporting our universities, our research centres and, notably, I want to emphasise this, the European Joint Research Centre, all of which are doing a remarkable job. Finally, it allows us to resolve a part of the cost of the ITER project, which is going to demonstrate the industrial feasibility of producing electricity by nuclear fusion. This will allow us to honour our international commitments to our partners in the ITER project – China, the United States, Russia, Japan and South Korea. Well done, Commissioner, you have our support and thanks. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, my first words will be to echo the compliments made to the Court of Auditors, to President Caldeira, and to Commissioner Šemeta. I am disappointed that the Council is not here, since it is the second budgetary branch, and I join my colleagues in saying that within the shared management, this is where we have the highest error rate, and the Council is not here to discuss this. Need I remind you that we refused to grant discharge to the Council? The least we could expect is that this institution be here today. I would like to say a few words on the DAS, which is the statement of assurance. This is an obligation under the Treaty. I would like to know, Mr President, Commissioner, whether we have a positive or negative DAS. I should also like to congratulate Ms Kaljulaid for her work in presenting the DAS opinion. Regarding the annual accounts, we have an unqualified certification opinion. I must say that I cannot get used to the fact that we are not entering in the accounts the EUR 30 billion that Member States owe us in respect of pensions, in application of accounting standards in the public sector. On the underlying transactions, we have two opinions and one observation. I therefore believe that we need to make progress so that we in Parliament know what is the general opinion on the accounts and underlying transactions. Finally, I think that the number of tests is far from enough: Two-hundred and thirty-eight in agriculture, 90 in outside access. I believe we need to analyse whether this number of tests is sufficient and once again, I would like to reiterate the proposal whereby the European Court of Auditors relies on national courts of auditors for its opinion on shared management, as authorised by the Treaty.

 Mr President, President of the European Commission, President of the European Council, I would like to welcome you as you are a great European democrat and European democracy finds its expression in this House. This House is your home. I would like to make two or three comments. Firstly, we are not in a crisis of the euro. The euro is not the problem. The euro is the solution. We are not in a crisis of Europe. Europe is not the problem, it is the solution. The problem is the indebtedness of Member States. You have protected the financial stability of the Member States at the level of the euro area and the European Union, and I thank you for that. We should ask ourselves the following question: what would have happened had we not had the euro? The franc, the escudo, the peseta would all have been devalued by between 10 and 35%, the Greek drachma by 40%, and the Deutschmark would have been re-valued by 20%. Let us reflect on this question and recognise that we are extremely lucky to have the euro, which is a solid currency, with vast foreign exchange reserves, which are respected on a global scale. The truth is that we are making progress towards greater European Union and, as the European Council of 23 October stated, towards a growth strategy with the single market. We shall enter the G20 summit with our heads held high. As Jean-Pierre Jouyet has written, too bad indeed if the financial markets end up imposing political Europe in an example of major historical irony. It is very good news that we are making progress towards this political Europe that we all want. Jean-Pierre Audy,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, my first words must be to congratulate our rapporteurs, Ms Gräßle and Mr Rivellini, as well as the rapporteurs for the groups, who have all done important work. The first thing I want to mention is simplification, and I would like to thank both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for having moved towards simplification. Both citizens and central and local government bodies are at the end of their tether. Every time we see an increase in the error rate, it is because the rules are too complicated. I warmly thank you, therefore, for the Cohesion Fund resources, and for the research that has been done, continuing on from Mr Carvalho’s excellent report. I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for having agreed to introduce a measure of consistency, by allowing the use of international accounting standards applicable to the public sector in future. We had to put an end to this inconsistency whereby the EU’s accountants made their own rules. Thank you also for having looked into shortening the timescale for granting discharge. It is only given after 16 months, which is far too long. I will end by mentioning two other subjects. The first is the national declarations: I have a lot of reservations about these. I believe we ought to discuss the matter from both the political and technical points of view, to make sure that these declarations are in keeping with international auditing standards applicable to the public sector. In auditing, we never ask for declarations of assurance from managing authorities. We ask them for representation letters stating that nothing has been concealed, but not letters of assurance. It is not the job of ministers to perform audits. What is more, in the Member States that have agreed to the principle, the error rates are no lower than in other countries. To conclude, I would like to thank the committees for having agreed to the principle of an investment section within the European Union, in order to keep investment operations separate. We will at last be able to have a budget framework for our major investment projects, such as GALILEO or ITER, which are planned over periods that go well beyond the annual framework, or even the financial perspective. Another significant step forward that is within sight in terms of budget presentation is the inclusion of the future project bonds in our accounting system, and the establishment of a major European investment plan to help growth within the Union. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, well done Mr Barroso, you have a balanced and apt view of the seriousness of the situation and of the common solutions that need to be found. I have listened carefully to the criticisms on the methods. Today, in this House, there are notable absentees: our Heads of State or Government. I have the following dream: that we would have a great political debate on the state of the Union, with the European Commission in its entirety – that is the case – representatives of the people, Heads of State or Government with their representatives, and President Van Rompuy. I would like to ask the heads of the political groups: did we invite Mr Van Rompuy? Did we invite the Heads of State or Government, as well as representatives of the national parliaments? There is a European Council on 17 October. It will be a momentous political moment. We must put your proposals on the table, Mr Barroso, we must have a big political debate with President van Rompuy, who could prepare this European Council session, at our mini part-session in Brussels on 13 October.

 A modern and effective infrastructure is of key importance for achieving the Europe 2020 objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as reducing unemployment, through the completion of the internal market. To this end, the Commission has proposed a ‘Connecting Europe Facility’ (CEF) for the next financial framework in order to accelerate infrastructure development in the fields of transport, energy and information and communication technology (ICT) networks, with particular emphasis on strategic cross-border aspects. In addition to equity instruments and grants, the CEF includes a new financial instrument to mobilise more private sector funding, as well as project bonds. However, the initial report by the Committee on Budgets and the subsequent negotiations with the Council focused on a limited number of issues including, for example, defining project bonds and evaluating the facility. Nevertheless, I welcome the proposals made in this report, which encourages projects in the fields of transport, energy and trans-European networks. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 Launched in 2009, the Baltic Sea macro-region brings together a coherent set of territories that want to cooperate in order to find better solutions to the economic and environmental problems facing them. This cooperation has taken the form of a ‘macro-regional strategy’, designed to coordinate the existing extensive sectoral cooperation and based on four pillars – environment, prosperity, accessibility and security – and an action plan setting out 15 priority areas and 80 flagship projects. The entire Mediterranean basin shares the same natural environment, and its shores are connected by the same history and culture. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which cannot be seized without the coordination and overview permitted by the definition of a macro-regional strategy. In terms of developing potential, maritime traffic must be placed at the heart of a transport strategy for the whole area, particularly for goods. The report also underlines the possibility of boosting the southern dimension of the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy, taking on a concrete territorial dimension which would guarantee greater management of migration flows and impact positively on the performance of the economies of the countries concerned.

 For the majority of the European Union’s neighbours, in other words, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, the EU is the main export market and the main source of imports. Therefore, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area is the most important and most effective instrument at our disposal for strengthening our trade links. The gradual dismantling of trade barriers and regulatory convergence in areas that have an impact on trade are rightly included in this Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. Beyond the economic aspect, free trade areas can be a core component of a wider political agreement, leading, in particular, to an association agreement. The rapporteur also stresses that, with the signature of agreements and the creation of the free trade area, the European Union might also provide its assistance and strengthen the role of civil society or even steer reforms, both in the public and private sectors. My vote in favour of the Ransdorf report applauds its social and democratic goals, which are fundamental aspects of our partnerships. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 On 30 September 2011, the Board of Governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) voted in favour of the necessary amendments to the agreement establishing the EBRD to enable it to expand its region of operations to the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. The report by Mr Binev explains that, in response to the political and economic situation in the countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean, the EBRD has developed a phased approach to the start of its activities. This report gives the European Union much more room for manoeuvre in its cooperation with the countries surrounding the Mediterranean. In fact, the EU representatives in the EBRD should encourage the bank to contribute to the transition towards open market economies by promoting social inclusion and energy efficiency, while taking into account the social, poverty, civil and human rights context. My work at European level has exactly the same goal: that of helping and supporting the Mediterranean countries during their democratic transitions following the wave of revolutions associated with the Arab Spring and during their political and economic transitions.

 The European Union is the principal donor of development aid, the principal investor and the second largest trade partner in Latin America. Latin America has not been hit as hard by the financial and economic crisis as the European economies, with a +4.5% growth outlook for 2012. Unfortunately, 180 million people are still living below the poverty threshold in Latin America. It was therefore important to define a new cooperation with Latin America, in particular, by changing the tools to help this cooperation. Indeed, as the rapporteur recommends, the focus should be on the gradual withdrawal of bilateral aid to middle income countries (MICs) in order to reinforce aid to low income countries (LICs). Faced with the humanitarian and health situation of Latin American countries, it is vital that essential services such as education, training, health and hygiene, removed by the European Commission, are reprioritised. Finally, and as a driving force behind the future of this cooperation, regional policies need to be stimulated in order to reset budgetary and fiscal policies. I voted for this report in order to highlight the need to shift the focus of regional cooperation policies onto urgent health and humanitarian matters. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 As the world’s largest importer of energy, it is now time for the European Union to define a European energy policy in order to provide more effective guidelines for energy use, both within and beyond our borders. The report emphasises, in particular, certain key concepts such as better coordination, diversification, energy sustainability/viability and stronger partnerships with supplier countries. Priority is given to important areas such as the major energy networks and infrastructures, strategic dialogues and international partnerships. It is also important to be able to exchange information, with the establishment of a platform for that purpose, and learn about European and third-country projects in the field of energy. I voted for this report in order to support a vital aspect: improving cooperation with third countries on energy and infrastructures. This multilateral cooperation will help to consolidate the partnerships with third countries in several areas; innovation and research into building reliable networks and facilities will ensure that the European Union has a diversified supply.

 Bluefin tuna stocks in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean have fallen dramatically over the years, and urgent action is needed to protect them. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), to which the EU is a contracting party under the common commercial policy, adopted a new recommendation at its annual meeting in 2010. The amendments include reducing the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and strengthening control measures used to implement a recovery plan. I am therefore in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 concerning a multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. The financial returns on fishing are so high that they actively encourage illegal fishing and other illegal activities. The time has come, therefore, to reassess the management measures adopted by ICCAT and to adapt them to current activities. It is also high time that the European Union acted quickly on its own initiative and as a precautionary measure to protect bluefin tuna and to rebuild stocks. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The European Commission has put the proposal for a financial transaction tax (FTT) at the centre of the debate, particularly in response to the serious consequences of the financial crisis. Ms Podimata’s report proposes to make the financial sector bear a share of the costs of the crisis, to dissuade financial establishments from taking excessive risks, to supplement regulatory measures aimed at preventing future crises and, finally, to generate additional revenue to finance the EU’s general budgets through the enrichment of the residence principle and the removal of pension funds or institutions for occupational retirement provision from the list of financial institutions to which the FTT would be applicable. The report puts forward strong arguments in favour of the application of the FTT at EU level. I am therefore in favour of this proposal. However, the report does not address the management of the revenue from the FTT and opts to have it managed by the multiannual financial framework programme. The FTT would make a significant contribution to the EU’s own resources, thereby broadening the framework for financing specific policies, projects and public goods. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 It was in 1985 that the European Union and China signed the first bilateral cooperation agreement. However, after almost 30 years of partnership, there is still a significant imbalance in trade relations between the EU and China. The list of these disharmonies shows worrying signs: access to Chinese public procurement is limited for foreign enterprises, protection of intellectual property is weak, there are systematic restrictions on the exportation of Chinese rare earths to European industries and, finally, the undervaluation and non-convertibility of the yuan pose a serious problem. Reciprocity, the cornerstone of the agreement, seems no longer, or insufficiently, present in trade relations. European enterprises are currently unable to invest in China under conditions similar to those governing Chinese investors in Europe. My vote in favour of the report by Ms de Sarnez lends support to the proposals made to rebalance EU-Chinese relations. It is also important to provide compliant protection tools and measures to update the terms of this agreement between the EU and China. Finally, we need to address the lack of transparency and reciprocal competition, which sours Sino-European relations today. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The Arab Spring represents an unprecedented revolution in the Mediterranean world. These revolutions have redefined the relationships between the Southern Mediterranean and the European Union, and have built a new trading partnership, founded on fundamental values such as human rights and democracy. This partnership must therefore be consolidated through the establishment of a free trade area, regional integration and a trade strategy. We have a unique opportunity to cooperate in the fields of employment and growth, to step up regional integration and the presence of the European Union through its trade, investment and financing activities. The report reaffirms trade as a solid pillar in the European Neighbourhood Policy, and as a means of involving SMEs by making them an additional tool for economic democratisation. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 There is no doubt that this draft resolution on maritime piracy strengthens the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP). Indeed, maritime transport has been a key vehicle for European economic growth, and not just growth in Europe, as more than three quarters of world trade is carried by sea. The European Union therefore has a genuine interest in ensuring that security is a factor in the common maritime policy. Over recent years, we have seen in the news a resurgence of criminal acts at sea. We find the greatest number of acts of maritime piracy in targeted areas, often concentrated in the Red Sea, and through which large numbers of European and international transport and trading vessels pass. Most of these acts remain unpunished. That is why this motion for a resolution is essential because it calls again for immediate and effective measures against impunity of this nature and calls for the need for strategic coordination between the European Union and third countries.

 Water is a resource for humankind and access to water is fundamental. Due to climate change, there are fears of a decline in the quantity and quality of water available, particularly drinking water, as well as a rise in the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. It is therefore necessary to rationalise water use and the European Parliament’s motion for a resolution calls for more efficient water usage especially in the sectors where most water is used, such as the agriculture sector. Also, the resolution underlines the need to make concrete commitments towards the promotion and protection of water resources, especially in light of the upcoming Rio+20 conference. That is why I voted for this resolution during the very week when the World Water Forum was taking place in Marseille. Jean Roatta  (PPE

The report underlines the importance of taking concrete steps to achieve gender parity in elected offices in the national parliaments and in the European Parliament. We should aim to achieve parity in electoral lists. The report also proposes measures designed to ensure parity within the European Commission, the EEAS and other political and administrative bodies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the signature of the agreement between the European Union and Morocco concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures on agricultural products and fishery products has an economic dimension and, above all, a political dimension. The agreement with Morocco represents support for the rural development policy, support for local farmers as well as support for the democratic process that was initiated several months ago after the parliamentary election. This agricultural agreement is therefore a major component of the advanced status granted to the Kingdom of Morocco in 2008. It also shows that the EU supports and encourages the programme of constitutional and democratic reforms in Morocco. Over and above the economic dimension, this agreement will formally enshrine the rapprochement between the European Union and Morocco. The credibility of the European Union is at stake. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot maintain bilateral relations that merely limp along. That is why I would encourage you to vote in favour of the signature of this agreement. It is a balanced, coherent agreement, which we need so that we can open as soon as possible the negotiations on a free trade agreement. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The European Union is the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid. In 2010, the European Union’s contribution totalled EUR 2.957 billion, and 36% of that aid came from the Commission. The Commission manages its humanitarian activities from its headquarters in Brussels and with the help of a network of local offices all around the world. The average annual budget managed by DG ECHO for its humanitarian aid activities between 2006 and 2010 was EUR 889 million. The report focuses on the following key issues: efficiency and effectiveness of the ECHO control, monitoring and supervision system, especially when framework partnership agreement (FPA) partners or international organisation partners (such as the United Nations) are involved. The report also underlines the need to ensure the sustainability, coherence and complementarity of humanitarian actions, which are key objectives of the EU’s development policy. I therefore voted in favour of this report. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The Committee on Development, on which I sit, worked with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, which was responsible for this report on women’s situation in war. This report deals with the responsibility of women in peace negotiations as well as the impact of armed conflict across the globe on women. The report recommends the creation of a post of Special EU Representative on Women within the European External Action Service (EEAS) and calls on the Member States to put in place action plans to improve the situation of women in conflict countries. As I agree fully with the actions to be taken to improve the situation of women, I voted in favour of this report. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The objective of ‘universal access to energy by 2030’ was launched in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In developing countries, households generally spend a high percentage of their budget on the purchase of low-quality fuels for heating and cooking compared with households with access to electricity and to liquid and gas fuels. In developing countries, sustainable energy access for the poor faces a number of barriers, notably: the inability of the poor to pay for the services, investment costs, connection costs and no national capacity to produce the energy generation equipment and spare parts required. The report stresses that, whilst none of the MDGs are specifically related to energy, access to modern, sustainable energy services for all is a prerequisite for achieving the MDGs. We now need to bring energy to the fore in the debate on the eradication of poverty, by establishing a specific programme focusing on ‘energy and development’ within the framework of the European Union’s development cooperation policy. It is for these priorities that I voted in favour of this report. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

 As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development on Mr Gallagher’s report, I thought it was important to point out that when the European Commission wants to impose sanctions on a country for unsustainable fishing practices, it should take into account that country’s level of development. This is because, according to the principle of policy coherence with development goals, it is crucial, in my opinion, that the measures adopted for fisheries do not undermine the development plans and strategies implemented by the European Union in these countries. Mr Gallagher’s draft report takes up this important idea for our Committee on Development specifying that the measures should not be unjustified, or even discriminatory. I therefore call on the European Commission, when it adopts such measures, to respect this principle of policy coherence with development objectives and to duly consider the level of development and the vulnerability of countries. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

 In an effort to promote and to allow access to energy in developing countries insofar as this access contributes to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), I feel that it is important for the European Parliament to respond to the United Nations General Assembly’s declaration of 2012 as the ‘International Year of Sustainable Energy for All’. However, Norbert Neuser’s politically biased report refuses developing countries the right to be free to choose their energy policy by calling on ‘the Commission and the Member States neither to fund nor to otherwise encourage the use of nuclear power in developing countries’. I therefore voted against this paragraph which imposes choices on developing countries by limiting the energy sources to which they can have access. Nuclear power is a clean energy source that could give millions of citizens in developing countries access to basic services such as mains electricity. Maurice Ponga,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, we will give our verdict for the third time on the new development cooperation instrument (DCI) providing for Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM) for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) banana-producing countries following the reduction in tariff preferences. This aid programme has a budget of EUR 190 million and is intended to support 10 ACP countries until 2013. It is crucially important for our African and Caribbean partners, since the banana sector is of considerable economic and social importance in these countries. I bitterly regret the fact that not all of Parliament’s demands concerning the use of delegated acts have been accepted for this instrument. We have nevertheless managed to make progress. Indeed, the text outlines clear objectives and specific criteria for the allocation of resources to the Commission. The Commission has also made a statement specifying how these criteria will be applied. Moreover, we have a statement from the Council regarding the next Multiannual Financial Framework, specifying that the latter will take due account of delegated acts in external aid instruments post-2013. Finally, Parliament states in its resolution – and this is a crucial point in my view – that the outcome of this conciliation does not set any kind of precedent. I have just come back from Togo, where the 22nd session of the ACP-European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly was being held, and I believe I can say that our ACP partners are counting on us, given the urgency of the situation. The funds ought to have been released two years ago. We must be aware of the terrible consequences for our ACP partners should the DCI/BAM Regulation be rejected. The situation of some farmers is catastrophic. We cannot wait any longer and must act accordingly. I am therefore counting on you to endorse this text. Maurice Ponga,

 Mr President, I wanted to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Ms Lövin, on her excellent work. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development, I am pleased that the Committee on Fisheries has taken up the points contained in our opinion, because it is vital for the development dimension to be taken into account in the measures to combat illegal fishing at the global level, for the sake of policy coherence and the close links with development policy. Indeed, combating illegal fishing requires global solutions and the involvement of all countries, including developing ones. However, countries’ technical and financial capabilities also need to be taken into account in the actions to be undertaken. The same constraints cannot be imposed on developed and developing countries without support measures. Small island states have very limited capabilities, for example. Therefore, they must be supported in their efforts to combat illegal fishing. That is why the Union will have to increase the budget for the fisheries sector when it signs agreements in this area in developing countries. Furthermore, it is vital to ensure that the measures to combat illegal fishing are actually applied, because this practice harms the development of countries insofar as it reduces the financial resources they could earn from fishing as an economic activity. The fact is, developing countries need those resources to implement social, economic and education policies. Lastly, it is important for the European Union, when implementing these measures to combat illegal fishing in developing countries, to encourage the involvement of civil society and businesses alongside the countries receiving aid. A holistic approach needs to be taken to halt the scourge of illegal fishing. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

 Madam President, I wanted to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Kaczmarek, on his excellent work. It is important that every year, the European Parliament take stock of the work of the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), insofar as this assembly plays a determining role in enhancing the North-South dialogue and in implementing a development policy that is founded on partnership and exchange. 2010 was an eventful year for the JPA, which met twice – as previous speakers have said – in Spain and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to discuss, among other things, the impact of climate change in ACP countries, the impact of the global crisis, freedom and independence of the media, and food security. In 2010, the JPA also sent the first election observation mission of this parliamentary term. I had the honour of co-chairing this mission in Burundi for the presidential elections with Mr Assarid, a Malian MP. This election observation mission was a real success. We were able to meet all the political players involved and thanks to the dual origin of this delegation, both ACP and European, we embodied a different legitimacy from European and African missions. I therefore call on the JPA Bureau to renew this experience, since it will make it possible to put into practice solidarity and the special relations that unite the European Union and ACP countries.

 I am glad that Parliament is stating its views on the current EU-Canada trade negotiations and outlining its priorities in this regard. Canada is undoubtedly a trade partner of the EU, but it is imperative that we in Parliament relay the concerns of our fellow citizens located both on European territory and in regions forming part of the European family, namely, the protection and defence of their interests. By ‘European family’, I mean the overseas countries and territories (OCT), which, although not strictly European territories, maintain a special relationship with the European Union, and, in particular, with the Member States of which they are part. In the trade negotiations currently under way, it is the archipelago of St Pierre and Miquelon, next door to Canada, that is particularly affected. I therefore call on the Commission, during the negotiations, to defend and protect the interests of that overseas country and territory situated in the North Atlantic Ocean. Maurice Ponga,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will today give its verdict for a second time on the amendment to the financing instrument for development cooperation providing for the establishment of Banana Accompanying Measures for the main ACP banana-producing countries. These accompanying measures are justified by the reduction in tariff preferences granted to the ACP countries following the conclusion, in December 2009, of the Geneva Agreement with the United States and the countries of Latin America. The European Union made a commitment at that time to provide EUR 190 million in support to the ACP countries to help them cope with this new competition. We amended both the form and the content of the Commission proposal at first reading. The Council disagreed with us on the form, which is why the regulation has been submitted for a second reading today. Indeed, the Council refused to allow the delegated acts procedure to be applied to strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes, and hence refused to implement the advances of the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament decided to react quickly, and that is crucial. We are therefore sending a strong political message to the ACP countries. The European Parliament is behind them and is doing everything in its power to ensure that the EUR 190 million are released as quickly as possible. Yet we are also sending a message to the Council. The European Parliament is defending its prerogatives as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. The ball is now in the Council’s court. The European Union made a commitment to the ACP countries. The Council should therefore shoulder its responsibilities, as Parliament has done. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question (Rule 149(8)) Maurice Ponga  (PPE

 Thank you for your question, Lord Dartmouth. All I would say is that there are international agreements in place that require the European Union to invest in its relations with the ACP countries, and this is one of the agreements that the European Union must prioritise. As far as I am concerned, I have never felt that this 190 million should be frozen. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

 I welcome the European Parliament’s decision to approve the interim agreement between the European Union and the Pacific States. This agreement reflects the commitment of the European Union to this region of the world and sends a strong political signal to the States in the region. I am pleased about that. The political resolution that accompanies this decision to approve the agreement provides an opportunity to point out our demands. We want to establish a balanced and fair relationship with the Pacific States; one which allows for the development of these island States while protecting the interests of our own citizens. While the interim agreement includes specific provisions on the rules of origin for fishery products, it was important to manage this derogation. Indeed, in order to ensure that this derogation, which should allow for the creation of jobs and wealth, is of genuine benefit to local populations and does not harm the European fishery product processing and canning industries, it was vital to provide for an assessment of its impact as soon as possible and to allow for its suspension, where necessary. Guarantees exist to ensure that the agreement is fair and that measures will be taken, if necessary, to protect our interests. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many years, the European Union has maintained a special and strong relationship with ACP countries. This special relationship has resulted, in particular, in the granting of tariff preferences. Such is the case for the banana sector, in which ACP countries have benefited from a preferential trading arrangement for their exports to the European Union. This preference has been challenged at the WTO, especially by the Latin American countries, which are large exporters of bananas. Therefore, in order to comply with WTO rules and to end a long dispute, the European Union accepted to reduce its tariffs in the banana sector in December 2009. On account of the privileged partnership that it maintains with ACP countries, the European Union nonetheless wanted to help banana-producing ACP countries to cope with this increased competition. Consequently, Europe has pledged EUR 190 million until 2013 to help banana-producing ACP countries to adapt, be competitive and restructure their sector if need be. In the report on which we will vote tomorrow, the European Parliament is reaffirming its commitment to, and support for, banana-producing ACP countries, and I very much welcome that. Thus, we have suggested, among other things, that the European Union could adopt complementary measures after 2013 if necessary. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleague Mrs Morin-Chartier and the other Members have said, on 27 and 28 February the violent storm Xynthia battered several French regions, claiming 53 lives and causing huge material damage. The storm was exceptionally intense; it caused devastating floods along the French coast. After Madeira, Europe has once again been affected. Brittany, the region of my colleague and friend, Mr Cadec, has been severely affected. A state of natural disaster has thus been declared in three French regions: Brittany, Poitou-Charentes and Pays de la Loire. In the face of these disasters, the European Union must demonstrate its responsiveness and express its solidarity. Words and a resolution alone will not enable us to support the victims of these disasters; we must also and above all provide financial aid. I therefore call on the European Commission – and my colleague Mr Béchu supports my request – to swiftly release the EU Solidarity Fund so as to help the disaster areas cope with the damage. This disaster shows that Mr Barnier’s proposal to create a European civil protection force is relevant. Europeans must take action together, since more and more disasters are occurring and they are affecting our European territories and, in particular, our most isolated and vulnerable regions, such as the islands in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean islands.

 I welcome the adoption, today, by a large majority (558 votes to 57), of the report by Mr van Nistelrooij. By adopting this report, Parliament is sending out a strong message to citizens and is responding to the social concerns relayed in particular by Eurocities. The report provides for the possibility of using the ERDF for the renovation and replacement of existing buildings and for new structures designed to help marginalised communities in rural or urban environments in each of the 27 Member States. This extension from the 12 States that joined in 2000 and 2007 to all the Member States offers solutions to the problems that insalubrious housing poses for certain marginalised communities throughout the EU. It will thus be possible to establish an integrated and sustainable approach at EU level. Furthermore, this extension dovetails perfectly with the aim of the 2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. I am pleased that Parliament has voted for these amendments and I hope that the regions concerned will find it a useful tool for solving what is an urgent and fundamental problem for these communities.

Mr President, thanks to the tenacity of the Swedish Presidency, which I too thank, we have the Treaty of Lisbon. However, a treaty such as this is not a project, but a tool, a toolbox to serve the European project, and it is therefore up to the men and women who manage the institutions – the Commission, its president, the Council – and to us here to make good use of these tools in the future, at the end of a transition period that has been long, too long. For we are now better equipped to take up three major challenges in the face of which, ladies and gentlemen, we will together be playing not only for the credibility of the European Union, but also, to repeat the word used by Mr Havel just now, for its sovereignty. The first challenge is that of the crisis, and we must not – we cannot – come out of it as we went into it, as if nothing had happened. There are lessons to be learnt in our dialogue with the United States, in particular, regarding governance, regarding solidarity, regarding transparency and regulation of the global economy, and for we Europeans there are lessons to be learnt as regards the safeguarding – I use that word deliberately – the consolidation of the internal market, in the ‘reconciliation of the market and society’, to repeat a word that I have adopted as my own, used by Mario Monti, to whom President Barroso has moreover usefully entrusted a task on this issue. The second challenge is that of green growth. In Kyoto, we took the lead on this issue, thanks to the European Commission. We must maintain this position by ensuring, of course, that our partners, the other large countries, the large regions, adopt a reciprocal attitude. And then, the third challenge is for us to be at the table, not ‘behind the table’, but ‘at the table’, of those who are going to decide on the world order – or disorder – over the next 20 years. This is not easy when we number 27 nations, but it is crucial all the same, unless we do not mind – which I personally do – being subcontractors or being under the influence of the other countries. This is why we have a great deal of confidence in the future work of the High Representative, whose job it will be to create a real common diplomatic and strategic culture. Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the sooner we are ready, the better it will be for European citizens. That is why we eagerly and confidently await the decisions that you will take. Michel Barnier  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Mr Barroso, there are several elements to, and reasons for, our show of confidence and our very clear vote tomorrow. The first element is that of democratic consistency: with regard to the choice of the 27 Heads of State or Government who chose you unanimously; with regard to what we said during the electoral campaign – it was not so long ago – and with regard to the citizens’ vote. We are not going to apologise for having won the elections, even though we are aware – we are well aware, I would say to our fellow Members – that we will have to surround you with more ideas than those of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) alone. Then, there is democratic consistency with regard to the exercise that you have been conducting for several weeks, in the demanding, sincere and humble dialogue with Parliament, and we are here to bear witness to it. There is a second reason, which is a conviction: the very strong conviction that there will be no strong policies in Europe if the institutions are weak. We need strong institutions. This is why we hope that the Treaty of Lisbon will be ratified. It is a tool box that will make the institutions work. We need a strong Commission that can confront the crisis as quickly as possible. The third reason is a contract of confidence that we have signed with you. In the face of this, the most serious and most profound economic, financial, food – let us not forget the one billion starving people in the world – and environmental crisis, we need the Commission to show its fighting spirit. We need you, and us with you, to learn all the lessons from this crisis, in terms of governance, regulation, innovation and new policies – I am thinking of the idea of a European savings bank to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the strategic sectors – and, with regard to the most profound crisis, the environmental crisis, to introduce a new model of economic and social growth, of green growth, as you yourself said. That, Mr Barroso, is why we shall be ready, tomorrow, to sign the contract of confidence with you. Michel Barnier  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should, of course, like to thank Commissioner Dimas for his presence and his answers and for the attention that he continues to pay to all these disasters. We did a great deal of work together when President Barroso asked me to draft a report, which he also mentioned, on the creation of a European civil protection force. I presented this report on 9 May 2006. When I re-read it, and I see all the disasters that have happened, I realise that it is still topical. Mrs Tzavela, obviously, it is not just Greece. Every country is affected, and I would add that there are not only natural disasters, there are also human disasters, caused by mankind. I am thinking of maritime disasters – Erika
 and countless others – and of Chernobyl-type industrial accidents. There are natural disasters other than fires. I am thinking of the tsunami. One day we can expect a tsunami in the Mediterranean such as the one at the start of the 20th century that totally destroyed the city of Messina. Frankly, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tools we are using are not up to these disasters, which are going to increase under the twin effect of global warming and transport. Hence the reason why I think we should be more ambitious. I am grateful to the Commission, to Commissioner Dimas and to all his teams from the Directorate-General that are putting the civil protection mechanism into operation. I believe that we must go further. It is conceivable to have enhanced cooperation with those Member States that want it. If there are not 27 of us to make up this civil protection force, let us start with 12 or 15 of us. Then you will see that this affects everyone. When I compile the list of disasters, I can say that everyone is affected: the floods that hit Germany in 2002, the major pandemics and also terrorism. That, Commissioner, is why I would like the Commission to take the initiative to go further, to propose that the Member States go further. Our Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, will support you in these proactive initiatives.

 Controlling production volumes is an essential tool which must be made available to all bodies involved in defending and managing protected designations of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indications (PGI), following the example of the cheese sector with the adoption of the Milk Package in March 2012. This will enable them to maintain a high level of quality and added value in their products and avoid market imbalances. Unfortunately, the Council and the Commission were unable to reach an agreement on this provision, which was supported by a majority in Parliament. However, other points in the quality package represent real progress, for example, in terms of protecting against misuse and shortening procedures. The Council, which is divided on this issue, has nevertheless agreed to confirm in a statement that this debate is not closed, but that it will now be included in the discussions on the reform of the single common market organisation (CMO). That is why I do not wish to call into question the agreement reached with the Council, as this would block the adoption of the text and put the debate on volumes management on hold. I will therefore vote against the amendment authorising this mechanism, which I otherwise fully support. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 Mr President, the 2006 reform was supposed to improve the competitiveness of the sugar beet sector in Europe. This reform was carried out at great sacrifice in terms of men and land. Factories were closed. Whole areas of land had to abandon beet production. Cane sugar refiners are now calling for the suspension of tariffs on sugar without any trade negotiation. Increased imports of cane sugar from other third countries would undermine the preferences granted to our traditional partners in developing countries and could halt investments in these countries. The European Union sugar market is totally open. As far as I am concerned, any delay in investments in African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the least developed countries (LDCs) cannot justify the refiners’ demand to disregard them. As a rapporteur for this House on the common market organisation (CMO) in the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), the ACP countries that I have encountered have explicitly asked me to keep the system in place today. Ladies and gentlemen, this House has already, on a number of occasions, had discussions, regarding, in particular, the Dess report in July 2011 and Resolution No 2010/2110, passed in March 2011. Yes, we must defend jobs. However, under the pretext of defending dozens of industrial jobs, do we need to have more people abandoning our lands with the removal of European producers? For three years now, is it not the case that our Parliament has, all too often, affirmed and reaffirmed its determination to defend our food self-sufficiency and to promote our agriculture as much as possible?

 After an amazing campaign of misinformation, Parliament has rejected the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). Just one article concerned Internet users. The prime purpose of the text was to protect us against counterfeiting, in particular intellectual property.

 We should welcome the adoption of this text as some excellent work has been done. Whilst not entirely perfect, the policy changes are significant in comparison with decisions made in recent years, notably, the measure that gives producers the right to group together so that they gain greater clout in bargaining with processors and distributors. From now on, interprofessional agreements will be an integral part of the European vocabulary, and the right of producers of protected designation of origin (PDO) / protected geographic indication (PGI) cheeses to manage their production volumes has finally been recognised. Other improvements such as, the requirement of contracts in the supply chain, or a mechanism ensuring that disadvantaged regions are not ‘drained’ of their milk production upon the expiry of dairy quotas, must be achieved in the years to come. The ‘soft landing’ promised by the Commissioner at the time of drafting, Ms Fischer Boel, should well and truly become a reality for European producers. From now on, producers must fully embrace the new tools established by European legislation in order to help further their interests and to take part in the running of their market. Michel Dantin,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, we have reached the end of our work. Commissioner, we agree with some of the points you just made. There is one word, however, that I wish to highlight: the word ‘quickly’. I do not think that we can agree on that. It was in February three years ago that the milk crisis erupted or reached its peak. That is how long it has taken us to reach a compromise allowing us to offer milk producers new prospects. I welcome the spirit in which we worked and congratulate our rapporteur, who, for this first, because it was a first for us to legislate together, enabled us to work in a spirit of genuine dialogue and with a shared desire to build something. We are therefore offering producers a new capacity, that of derogating from competition law and organising themselves into stronger units. However, Commissioner, we all know only too well that this is just one stage, just one step, and that we have not yet found the real solution and the real tools to move beyond the era of milk quotas. An exit phase should be prepared. That phase has not yet been designed. We have to continue to work on that aspect. As you said, we have not yet completely resolved the issue of vulnerable regions either. Even if we are offering them a tool, with the possibility of organising themselves better with the geographical protection mechanisms, we are still not enabling them to keep milk in those regions. It is absolutely essential for the report that you are going to submit to us in 2014 to set out solutions that allow us to maintain this activity in vulnerable regions, where grass is often the only production and where milk is often the only way of making a living. Without it, all of the work and all of the hopes that we have put in this text will be in vain for many farmers. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, you fulfil your duties well. You defend a text with conviction. This is not your text, however. It is an inherited text. We know very well that, if you had had to negotiate this text yourself, it would have been different because you are currently involved in the CAP negotiations and you are aware that it is difficult to impose environmental constraints on European farmers when texts such as this proposal ignore that issue completely. You are aware that it is difficult to establish a common framework for the CAP because the standard of living differs from one EU country to another. Here, we are not taking into account the standard of living of Moroccan producers, whom, we are supposed to believe, represent El Dorado. Yes, the situation is complicated as I am sure that nobody here in this House wants to jeopardise Morocco’s development. Morocco is a country that we need for stability in North Africa. Morocco is a gateway for developing new trade and we know that every time we develop new trade, both parties benefit to some extent. However, I will get back to what I was saying about the environment. How are we going to explain to European farmers that we are perhaps going to force them to comply with the Water Framework Directive under the system of cross-compliance but that at the same time we are not going to pay any attention to the production conditions of the tomatoes that are allowed to enter? How are we going to explain to them that the water table is falling by two metres per year in some regions but that that is being ignored? I firmly believe that the model that we are proposing to the Moroccans is not a sustainable model. Perhaps our producers do not have to worry because, with the system they are being offered, Moroccan producers will die before them. This is serious, however. In my opinion, we have to defend Morocco, we have to defend democracy in Morocco but we also have to take care to ensure that what we are proposing is balanced from an environmental, social and economic perspective. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is now three years since the debate on the aid programme for the most deprived got desperately bogged down in Council. This untenable deadlock is not acceptable. It is all the more unacceptable given that the death sentence has been pronounced on the programme at a time when our continent is going through an economic and social crisis of unprecedented violence, which is throwing so many of our fellow citizens into turmoil. Some symbols construct Europe; others weaken it dangerously. Let us ensure that we do not destroy today what was patiently constructed yesterday, especially at a time when the difficulties we face seem to be straining the bonds that unite our States. Those same difficulties are pushing people towards nationalist sentiments and to turn their backs on Europe. Re-establishing the every man for himself principle as a normal and acceptable reflex is far removed from my idea of Europe and from that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), to which I belong. Our people deserve better. They deserve the Europe we have been building together for more than 50 years – a Europe that is more than a simple economic agreement. Quite the opposite, Europe embodies values that, more than ever, we need to embrace – values that place human beings at the top of the political agenda. Today, it is imperative that we move away from sterile legal debate in order to take fair and responsible political decisions. Allocating resources to the European Social Fund within a fund created specifically for that purpose under the revised common agricultural policy is not what the debate is about. It is no longer what the debate is about. The ruling of the Court of Justice has now created an emergency which will soon affect 18 million people receiving food aid. The real question now relates to our common vision of Europe and its future. I am convinced that its destiny does not, under any circumstances, lie in the full or partial renationalisation of food aid, however symbolically. Let there be no mistake: only if we act together will we succeed in tackling the huge challenges we face today. It is only by acting together, showing solidarity and standing united that, on our continent, we will retain the resources to guarantee the future prosperity of all our fellow citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Dess, the shadow rapporteurs and other contributors on the work that they have done to draft this text. In my opinion, it is both balanced and ambitious. We will be voting on the report tomorrow. Almost six months after Mr Lyon drafted his report setting out the European Parliament’s views on the common agricultural policy (CAP) post-2013, the European Commission decided to draw on the report by including many of its ideas in the communication issued on 18 November 2010. The new report, which was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, affirms the new direction that we would like the common agricultural policy to take in the coming years. Our farmers are not there to produce mere commodities, or wares to sell. They are there, above all, to produce food for Europe’s 500 million citizens, but also to help to feed the rest of the world. Stating it in these terms is not just semantics: it is a philosophical choice that we are making. Mr Dess’s report endorses a positive approach to agriculture’s environmental and ecological contribution and therefore appeals for a reduction of the often onerous administrative procedures generated by European and national legislation. By arguing in favour of graduated direct payments and a review of the regulatory instruments, the report also provides a new perspective on social perception of the CAP and of global trade. As we speak, the G20 in Paris is beginning discussions on regulating the global commodities markets, with particular reference to agricultural commodities. Parliament’s approach, then, has not been defined in a vacuum, where we are cut off from the world. Rather, it is part of the wider deliberations on how to come up with a global response to a global challenge. As with Mr Lyon’s report one year ago and Mr Garriga Polledo’s report on the financial perspectives last month, tomorrow we will be voting in favour of maintaining the agricultural budget for the 2014-2020 programming period. I am sure that it will be a close-run thing, but we do need to take a stand and to make choices, because we will not have the money to do everything ...

 Mr President, I should like to thank the Spanish producers who submitted this timely petition to us. Indeed, for months now, we in Parliament have been warning the Commission of the danger to our internal market of a number of bilateral agreements. Clearly, we are sensitive to the issue of Morocco’s development. Clearly, we know that creating stability for the Moroccan people in their own country is the best possible solution, and that it will stop us from having to solve numerous immigration problems in the future. However, when the Commission tells us that a new agreement will simply ratify a situation, we can plainly see, through the reports by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), that the situation to which the Commission refers is not the real solution. Furthermore, I should like to alert the Commission to another point. We are told that the negotiated – the renegotiated – agreements will enable us to support Moroccan producers. Which producers are we talking about, though? The exporters are primarily large agri-food companies that have set up huge farms in Morocco. Small Moroccan producers are not the ones who benefit from our agreements, as they do not have the capacity to produce in conditions acceptable to the European market. Let us not confuse the issue, but do not mislead the MEPs either: that is my request to the Commission. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for my group, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the conditions in which we were able to work with him on this matter. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe this is a truly strategic matter at the moment. We have already heard about China. I should like to quote a figure: in 2010, the Chinese bought 49% of the soymeal placed on the market. The forecast for 2011 is that the same customers will buy 57% of the total quantities placed on the market. Hence, it really is a matter of European independence that we are looking at in the medium term. Imagine for a moment that some very intensive farming regions found themselves without imported soya for a week: what would happen? We urgently need to redevelop these crops in our region. My country introduced a policy in the context of Article 68 back in 2010. This policy demonstrated that production could be adapted to policies.

Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I believe that we should be pleased, because we may be talking about a crisis today, but this is because our system has worked. We have the strongest consumer protection system in the world. Consumers need to bear that in mind right now. However, the system did not work properly, and before we come up with another one, I believe that we must carefully and comprehensively look at the reasons why the problem was discovered so late, and we must ask ourselves about the causes of this delay. However, I think that, apart from denouncing the criminal act itself, we must also question why it happened. I believe that, because of our actions, the agricultural and agri-food sectors are in a race towards low costs and towards the lowest prices on the supply side, and we are no longer shielded from deviations such as this type of unacceptable behaviour. So, Commissioner, do you intend to increase the penalties for such acts? My second question is about how we will provide immediate support – and I mean immediate – to the breeders concerned. This is because the margins are so weak that, if some people do not receive support very soon, or even advances on amounts owed to them, these breeders will disappear by the time the procedure reaches a conclusion at what I would call ‘normal’ speed. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Madam President, I think that the Member who asked a question actually had a comment to make on a situation rather than a question to put to me. Obviously, we know that the system has gone wrong. However, with regard to European consumers, I would like to emphasise how strict our protection system is. We cannot let the statement that nothing has been done go unchallenged, given that we have the highest standards in the world. Michel Dantin  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in the thanks and congratulations addressed to those who have managed to conclude these very difficult negotiations. We are getting ready to approve a budget tomorrow which is a big step forward for the Europe of mobility and the Europe of young people. Above all, this budget demonstrates Parliament’s determination not to abandon large-scale European investments during this crisis period. However, I would like to share with you my concern and my displeasure about the choice made today by some political groups and, in particular, the Socialists, whose representatives were in government jobs at key moments, to jeopardise ITER, the only fundamental long-term research project in the European Union in which we play a leading role. As you know, the European Union made a commitment last June to contribute an additional EUR 1.3 billion to this project, which is crucial for our security. It is therefore Europe’s credibility in the world that is going to be called into question by our vote. This attitude has meant that we have lost nearly EUR 600 million of unused money in 2010, which could have been allocated to ITER. This is ridiculous! Michel Dantin  (PPE

 Mr President, our fellow citizens have expectations of us, they have expectations of Europe on the issue of world governance. We must be a proactive force, we must be a decisive force. Several speakers this morning have made the point that the French Presidency of the G20 could represent an opportunity for Europe. I clearly share this view, and I believe that our Parliament ought to be regularly informed of the progress of the G20’s work by the Presidency itself. I understand that the President of the French Republic would be willing to come and address us. Mr President, I think that you should invite him to do so. Michel Dantin,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, Commissioner, you have a good command of the French language and you know my country well. In France, there is an expression that describes something one dreams of but which never materialises, we talk about the Arlésienne
. For farmers, simplification is undoubtedly one of the forms, one of the faces of the Arlésienne
. As you have said, the Commission has already taken action to try and simplify procedures and I would like to go into a bit more detail. To my mind, there are two aspects to this issue. Firstly, there is everything to do with the requests for aid. I think it should be recognised that there has been an effort to simplify the paperwork during these last few years and months, and we give you credit for that. Secondly, there are the restrictions relating to all the conditions, the never-ending reporting requested from farmers for everything they do: taking a trailer full of manure to a field, using a dose of fertiliser in another field, using a dose of plant protection product in a third field, and if they make a mistake, they are sanctioned. Faced with this situation, Commissioner, I believe that we certainly need to find solutions. Last week, while presenting the proposal for the future common agricultural policy, you mentioned a few integrative measures that could be implemented and that could, in fact, lead, through the outcome produced by these measures, to measures that can be controlled by opinion, by farmers as well as by the Commission, measures for which we can be sure of the scientific effect. I have in mind the example of crop rotation. These measures should enable us to simplify the obligations imposed on farmers. This represents a considerable amount of work for the future. Furthermore, today as you did last week, you mentioned what is incumbent on Member States and I think you are right. Every year, the Commission controllers visit Member States before visiting the farmers. They go there with a critical eye to find what is not right. Yet could we not change their mission slightly, Commissioner, and ask them to also list – this would be beneficial to the Member States – areas where the Member States are going too far in applying EU legislation? Going too far is to impose on farmers obligations which are pointless in relation to the regulations. By doing so, you would have improved Europe’s image among our fellow citizens.

Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has been said, for bees are indeed a symbolic species, guardians of our environment. Currently, there are many research programmes dedicated to bees, with sometimes contradictory findings. A few days ago, a scientist came to see me and explained that the numerous planes that we can see in the sky have an effect on the diffraction of sun rays, leading to exhaustion and therefore to the excessive mortality of bees, for instance. Contrary to what one of our fellow Members on the right of this Chamber just said, I believe that here we have an example of a sector where pooling our knowledge and coordinating research programmes can provide a solution to the problems faced by each of our countries. Yes, Europe can be useful. This example of bees is maybe representative of European integration. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what a funny old world the agricultural world is! A year ago, in this Chamber, we were all bemoaning the general production situation. Today, one production sector, the cereal sector, is doing better than the others – and I think we should, all the same, welcome that. However, its success is unfortunately having very serious repercussions for another sector, the livestock sector. The real issue today is the agricultural industry’s inability to pass on the costs it has to incur to consumers. Therefore, as has already been said this morning, we need to help organise producers so that they can make their presence felt in their dealings with their customers and, in particular, in their dealings with the large-scale distribution sector. However, the chain, the functioning of the markets is more pernicious. How can we explain the fact that, for years, decades, we said that South American countries were placing a strain on production and bringing prices down? How can we explain that, although prices are today increasing again in those countries, we cannot pass on that increase to our producers because, yes, there has been an increase in costs, but – and this must also be said – there has been no increase in producer prices? How can we fail to mention the cost differentials that exist between our countries? Admittedly, this is partly a question of national responsibilities. However, the dumping that goes on today between our various countries helps destabilise markets, and I believe that Europe should tackle this issue. Yes, solutions must be found. European cereal producers are aware, I think, of the situation faced by their main customers – farmers. They are prepared to enter into a contractual agreement. Are you prepared, Commissioner, to support that agreement? Michel Dantin  (PPE
),

The amendment I tabled along with Mr Dess and 77 other MEPs demands full compliance by agricultural imports with European health, social, and consumer, environmental and animal protection standards. It is, after all, extraordinary to demand that European farmers conform to the highest production standards in the world, while at the same time increasing the quantity of agricultural products that can enter Europe without meeting those same standards. Consumers must be able to benefit from a single level of protection, no matter what they buy, and farmers must be rewarded for their tremendous efforts, not subjected to de facto 
unfair competition on the part of third countries. That is my idea of a balanced food and agriculture policy, anyway. This resolution sends a clear message to the Commission and to third countries, which is why I support it. Michel Dantin  (PPE
),

 France is one of the countries of the Union with the highest birth rates. This is due to a set of measures contained in an all-embracing family policy. The resolution as it stands after the votes on the amendments does not bring about any real improvement. On the contrary, it will throw everything into question because the budgetary burden of the measures cannot be borne at this time. Those are the reasons that led me to withhold approval from the text, which is, incidentally, well meaning. Michel Dantin  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report entrusted to our fellow Member, Mr Bové, addresses what is, today, a crucial issue for society, from consumers to producers. The Commission’s figures speak volumes, Commissioner: 20 years ago, milk producers received 31% of the chain’s turnover, which back then equated to just over EUR 450 million. Today, they receive only 24% of the turnover, or just under EUR 550 million. Other examples exist with regard to fruit, meat and so on. Clarifying pricing is therefore today a prerequisite for reforming the common agricultural policy (CAP) because, if we do not clarify it, the CAP will, in future, seem like a bottomless pit in the eyes of the public and of farmers themselves. The CAP’s profits are today being siphoned off, but for the benefit of whom, of what? Ladies and gentlemen, it is our duty to understand what is going on. Contrary to what I am hearing from certain quarters, producers are no less well organised today than they were 20 or 30 years ago. However, the other stakeholders have grown, and the number of producers has decreased even more rapidly than that of farmers. The chain has become longer, too. This situation requires us to adapt competition law and to supplement the market crisis management tools, which no longer seem suited to the new architecture of the chains linking producers to consumers. Lastly, there is the specific issue of quality products, in particular, with regard to imported imitations. We need clarity. Commissioner, your services are examining the functioning of the French prices and margins observatory. There is room for improvement, but it already contains a wealth of information on consumer-level pricing and on the niches where margins are hidden. I should like to commend the work that has also been done by our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Köstinger. Attacks have been made here and there today. One of the merits of our Parliament is that we respect different points of view. This is also the case with regard to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Everyone remains free to vote as they wish. For my part, I shall not compromise my vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Michel Dantin,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Lyon, as well as the team of shadow rapporteurs, who I feel cooperated effectively with him on this report. As far as our group is concerned, this report conveys an ambition for European agriculture. It was written following the raw material crises of 2007 and 2008 and following the farming crisis of 2009, which taught us that liberalism is not the solution for agriculture. Our agriculture is firstly intended to provide – to guarantee – food security for 450 million Europeans, but we must also take our place on solvent markets. It is clear that the conditions that have prevailed since the middle of the 20th century have evolved, that techniques have evolved and must still evolve, that they must change, and that agricultural policy instruments must also evolve. Agriculture must be supported in this evolution. While the first pillar, financed solely from the EU budget, must support the level of societal demands that we attach to agriculture, the second, cofinanced pillar must continue to support the modernisation of agriculture and agri-foods so as to take the new contexts into account. This policy will also have to be fairer – yes, I did say fairer – between countries and between farmers themselves. It is clearly our wish to give hope back to the 14 million farmers and their families, in particular to ensure the replacement of the 4.5 million farmers who, today, are over 60 and who are going to leave the profession. The issue of generational change will be one of our concerns. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).  
– (FR) 
Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent work that has been done. The text has developed between the two readings, and seems to be going in the right direction. In the year since we began discussing this issue, I have noticed that the public – at least in my region – is baffled when they see how little coordination there is between rail companies today. How can we, in this House, legitimately call for more ambition with regard to the environment? Should we merely express our regret that Copenhagen was not a complete success, when we in Europe are incapable of actually shifting our freight transport to rail, either purely to rail or to multimodal transport? Some sectors of multimodal transport have developed, and it has taken time for road hauliers to adapt, but they have been able to appreciate the complementary nature of this system and demonstrate that it is effective. We cannot have a debate today if nothing comes of it afterwards; we have an obligation to act, and to act quickly. It is true that, beyond this text, there may be some problems here and there with infrastructure. I would particularly like to draw your attention, Commissioner, to the issue of cross-border sections. They are often nobody’s responsibility, yet they are the link we need to successfully complete our European project. I have also heard some parties, and more specifically the social partners, express the fear that some powers may be lost. However, I am convinced that the success of this project will provide an opportunity for us to work harder, and to work harder together. I feel this is very much an issue on which Europe can show its practical side to our fellow citizens. We certainly need this. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, as you well know, agriculture is an economic sector that comprises specific features that mean that public intervention may occasionally be necessary, if not desirable, in the interests of producers, consumers and the public. There are at least three reasons why public intervention in this economic sector is as justifiable in the European Union as it is in other countries of the world. The characteristics of supply of agricultural goods and the demand for foodstuffs make agricultural markets unstable. Agriculture also produces non-market goods and helps ensure a certain degree of social stability in our countries and our countryside through the jobs that it creates. Above all, agriculture is the basis of an abundant, varied and healthy food supply. Can we be satisfied, then, with the current economic situation of our rural areas and our farmers? A few days ago, Commissioner, a senior official gave me the following figures for his département
 – as it happens, this is a French département
 that you know well, a livestock farming department. The administrative centre holds 2 500 agricultural accounts. Of those, 800 have a debt ratio in excess of 80%, and 20% have a debt ratio of 100% or more. Faced with such figures – which, I admit, surprised even me – the issue to be dealt with today is not just one of revenue but of the decapitalisation of European agriculture. Less aid, less public intervention and more restrictions on production: that is a truly explosive combination. It is true that the general economic crisis is aggravating the situation. However, we must also question certain decisions taken by the Commission, certain decisions taken by your colleagues, Commissioner. Agriculture remains a bargaining chip in trade agreements. Despite the situation in Europe, meat, certain cereals, fruits and vegetables are all affected. The recent agreement between the European Union and the Andean countries, in particular, Peru and Colombia, will sacrifice the producers of the outermost regions. We cannot continue with such a policy. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Mr President, Mrs Paulsen, thank you for your report. I would like to applaud the work that has been done by the various shadow rapporteurs as part of the preparation for this dossier and, in particular, the rapporteur for my group, Mrs Jeggle. This issue resonates differently in the various European countries. Not all producers or consumers perceive the issue in the same way. In spite of this, European legislation is gradually succeeding in creating a very strict standard, which I feel we should make much better use of in international negotiations and, in particular, in the control of imported products. However, as has already been said, these rules carry a cost, and every day we are seeing this cost rise for farmers and other operators, at the very time when the profitability of farming is being hit hard. This is, therefore, a clear justification for the common agricultural policy. If we spend EUR 100 per head per year to finance a common agricultural policy, animal welfare is one good reason why this funding is needed. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Mr President, I would like to thank our colleague, Mr Dorfmann, for his excellent work on this report. I think it sums up perfectly the issue as it stands today in terms of the Commission’s proposals. It is the Commissioner whom I would like to address in particular. This work has been going on for several months now. It is creating great agitation within several of our countries’ industries, which are threatened with reclassification, and this reclassification is happening or may happen at a time when – and this will be the subject of tomorrow evening’s oral question – many production sectors are experiencing particular difficulties. We therefore need to move forward and move forward quickly. I do not think we can wait three years to come up with a clear answer for the farmers who are affected by this delimitation exercise. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Scottà, I find it truly symbolic, Commissioner, that your first speech before this House should be on the very subject of quality policy. I believe that we take the same approach to these quality products. Yes, they represent an opportunity for our most fragile regions. Yes, they are a means by which to make the operators of a region and, in particular, farmers, more dynamic. Yes, they represent a strong signal sent out to European consumers, but also to consumers throughout the world, with regard to our agricultural model. Burgundy wine, Parma ham, certain Spanish meats – they have meaning far beyond the borders of each of our countries, far beyond the borders of Europe. The resolution that we shall no doubt adopt tomorrow offers you, Commissioner, a greater degree of ambition with regard to this policy of quality products, of products identified by different signs. European policy must be clearer; it must stop producers from being taken over by certain large industrial or distribution groups, which would clearly like to deprive producers of the benefit of the added value that these products give them. During the hearing, I drew your attention to the need to give organisations that bear, in particular, designations of origin overall responsibility for managing their products. Management of production rights is a fundamental part of quality production policy. Moreover, almost all of our committee voted in favour of an amendment along these lines. I should like to respond to our UK fellow Members with regard to paragraph 19 on the fruit and vegetables sector. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we must not go backwards, but neither must we allow the huge vacuum in fruit and vegetable policy that means that, today, distributors are the only ones calling the shots. Let us together interpret this amendment as a call to find a new middle way. Commissioner, you can very quickly convince us of your enthusiasm for this specific policy, which gives consumers a different image of agriculture. Now present us with a good text. Do so quickly; we have faith in you. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, thank you, once again, for your attention. The price crisis in 2007-2008 highlighted the weak position of consumers with regard to price volatility. The agricultural crisis of 2009 is having a much more detrimental effect on farms than the indices reveal. Why? Because the upward trend in agricultural prices was portrayed by many as sustainable, and because farmers without doubt invested far too much in 2008 and at the beginning of 2009 – far too much because a delay has built up since the beginning of the 2000s. On several occasions, Commissioner, you have expressed a desire to no longer intervene in market regulation in the same way. But have we failed to remember over the last 20 years that agricultural commodities are primarily food products and that we need a certain degree of price stability at both ends of the chain? Price stability is required at consumer level, on the one hand, because, due to other financial commitments such as mortgages, parenting and leisure activities, the consumer does not have enough leftover income to cope with price fluctuations. At producer level, on the other hand, price stability is required because business activity involves significant capital, which requires heavy investment. Organisation within the sectors that includes all the elements of the supply chain, as well as the new players – I am referring to the mass catering sector and processing companies for quick-frozen or even fresh-prepared products – can undoubtedly lead to the introduction of private tools for stabilising prices. Do you think it is possible to find a way forward with this, Commissioner, and is the Commission ready to participate in such discussions? Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your statement, which I believe reflects the remarkable work you have done during your mandate. Europe has chosen a food model to protect its population. Our fellow citizens are ready to pay EUR 100 per year per capita if we guarantee the quality of their food. The other day in committee, we learnt of the Food and Veterinary Office’s report. I must tell you that, as a new MEP, I was deeply concerned to see the discomfort of your staff, who obviously could not answer or did not want to answer our questions. Commissioner, should we be ashamed of having strict rules to protect our consumers? Should we be ashamed of imposing these rules on those who want to feed our consumers? Are we ashamed when, in order to sell aircraft or cars, these same countries force us to establish this or that factory or impose this or that condition on us? Our market access conditions are important conditions because they affect food and they affect the health of our residents. We have nothing to be ashamed of. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner – I would have liked to have been able to address the Presidency of the Council too – ladies and gentlemen, as you yourself acknowledged the other day, Commissioner, to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the price paid to dairy producers no longer covers the current costs of production. What that means is that our producers are in the process of decapitalising. Just now, you listed the measures you have taken in the past nine months. Those measures do exist, we will grant you that. They have not, however, produced the anticipated effects because, in our view, they are not extensive enough, and there is definitely too much uncertainty about how effective their target is. This morning you mentioned a recovery in the market, but the producers will certainly only see the effects of this in the payments made at the beginning of next year. The agricultural products market is not the same as the market in metals or the energy market. It calls for regulatory tools, because the cycles of the seasons and nature also have an effect on market conditions. Your interpretation of the health check, carried out under the French Presidency, surprises us, since the interim assessments that it produced in relation to the dairy sector leave all avenues open, including the possibility of new decisions on tools for regulating the markets. The French delegation, to which I belong, is convinced that a renewed quotas system will be necessary after 2013. The tension that existed on the food products market prior to the current economic crisis has demonstrated the fragility of the balance across the world between production and consumption. After having partially dismantled the intervention tools, we have neither the right nor the legitimacy to dismantle today the production tools that we will need in the short term. Commissioner, we must give farmers back their dignity: these are men and women who are not afraid of hard work. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 Madam President, Mr Diamandouros, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us give the People’s Europe a face. It is the responsibility of all the European institutions to do everything in their power so that citizens are informed of all their means of redress if there are violations of Community law or bad administration by European institutions. First of all, I would like to praise the work of my colleague, Mrs Nedelcheva, for her report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2009. The European Commission has been the object of most of the Ombudsman’s criticism, often for a lack of information. The report by my fellow Member, Mrs Paliadeli, whom I would also like to congratulate, is a glaring example. Next, I would like to thank our European Ombudsman for all the work that has been accomplished, together with his whole team, and for his accessibility and his excellent collaboration with the Committee on Petitions. This is very important. His role represents an important safeguard of respect for the principle of transparency and good administration, and it is there that we will obtain genuine protection for our fellow citizens. Finally, it is time that our fellow citizens were better informed of the means of redress available to them with regard to the European Commission: namely, the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions. In order to do that, we need an Internet portal, certainly, but we need a common one, as we have already requested from you. This would provide real help to our citizens. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 I did not wish to support this report insofar as an increase from 14 to 20 weeks on full pay would have catastrophic financial consequences for several Member States. The OECD study shows that there will be very substantial costs for the social budgets of Member States. For France, the annual amount is EUR 1.3 billion, and for the United Kingdom GBP 2.4 billion. In the current economic situation, increases in these budgets cannot be absorbed. What is more, businesses would have to bear these additional costs, which is impossible. However, supporting women during maternity is essential. Applying these measures poses a very great risk to the employment of women. The OECD study also shows that extending maternity leave would result in a decrease in female employment. In wishing to help women, there is a risk of penalising them in the job market. I wish to help women in their employment and to support them during maternity. The increase from 14 to 18 weeks proposed by the Commission was a real step forward. Another advance would have been to have progressive measures concerning childcare methods. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Firstly, the fact that combating poverty has been taken into account in the 2020 strategy is, for me, a significant advance. The economic crisis has intensified the problem of poverty in recent years. The European Union must be able to encourage Member States to face up to this problem. Secondly, the European Social Fund (ESF) is an essential European tool in combating poverty. I am the rapporteur for the European Social Fund and I support its use in order to get back to work the people who are furthest away from the labour market. This has been the ESF’s role since it was set up under the Treaty of Rome, and it must keep employment as its prime objective. Thirdly, I am against a minimum income without contributing in return, except for people who are unfit for work. Employment is the benchmark in reducing poverty. It is the only way of giving back dignity to everyone. Fourthly, the governments of Member States have a responsibility to combat poverty actively. Europe is there to support them and to complement what they do but not to take their place. Europe cannot cure all ills. Above all, Member States must face up to their responsibilities. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need European legislation that will protect the health of pregnant women and women who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding, and we must rise to the demographic challenge we are facing and encourage an increase in birth rates in Europe. However, this advance must not serve as a disincentive to employ women. I would emphasise three points. Firstly, I welcome the European Commission’s proposal on the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. Indeed, I would emphasise the title, which is the legal framework of this directive, because too often, we tend to forget what exactly this text is about. We are talking here about women because, until we receive proof to the contrary, men cannot give birth. The debate tends to become diluted as a result of the reference made to paternity or parental leave. Let us solve the problem faced by women first, by focusing on their health when they bring a child into the world. We must implement genuine guarantees to protect the health of these women in the labour market. Paternity and parental leave will be dealt with in another directive. Secondly, the debate revolves around the number of weeks. Currently, the average leave period is set at 14 weeks. The European Commission is proposing 18 weeks and the report 20. Obviously, as a woman and mother of three children, I want mothers to be able to stay with their babies for as long as possible. However, this then begs the question: who is going to pay for this extension from 14 to 20 weeks? The state? Businesses? I am convinced that the average increase from 14 to 18 weeks is a major European advance and a real investment by our economy towards promoting a rise in birth rates in Europe. Twenty weeks is liable to have a negative impact on female employment: it would put a brake on their employment. Businesses and our States cannot support this additional huge financial burden at this time of crisis. Thirdly, more priority must be given to improving childcare so that mothers can achieve a work-life balance. Little progress has been made on this matter despite the many appeals by our Parliament. Therefore, let us not be counterproductive and let us not send women back home. Pascale Gruny  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a pivotal moment in the debate on the future of the European Social Fund (ESF). At a time when employment has become the number one preoccupation of all countries and all European regions, I am proud of the resolution Parliament has proposed today on the future of the ESF. This text is responsible, concrete and opens doors to the future. Now more than ever, our territories need a cohesion policy and thus, support from the European structural funds. The ESF has been in place since 1957 and was established by the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, the Treaty of Rome. Its legitimacy is not in doubt. My position on the future of the ESF is simple and clear and can be summarised in three points. First, a European Social Fund must remain focused on employment, combating poverty, of course, but by getting people into work and not by other means. Today, employment must have our full attention and must be our priority. I am convinced that a person who returns to employment is also a person who regains his human dignity. Second, an effective European Social Fund must have clear, pragmatic rules that do not discourage operators. That is why I support my political group, which is calling for greater visibility for the ESF, particularly to improve its uptake. Just imagine, budget allocations are sometimes returned unused to the European Union, while unemployment rates have never been so high. Third, and finally, we need a fund that is included in the broader framework of a strong European cohesion policy. Decisions must be taken on the ESF with partners that are as close to the ground as possible. Commissioners, can you assure us that the ESF will meet these expectations? Pascale Gruny,

Madam President, we need long-term legislation to improve employment in Europe and reduce poverty. We need to address the problem of unemployment with a view to sustainable growth. I should like to make three points. First of all, the Council proposes that the guidelines for employment policies in the Member States be established every 10 years. I agree, because we need a long-term perspective, but then we also need real milestones every three years to ensure that we do not lose sight of developments on the labour market. Secondly, I tabled an amendment, which was not adopted, in which I proposed that an employment observatory be established to conduct a specific analysis of future jobs. Many young people leave school or university without any training that meets the needs of the labour market. We need to anticipate future jobs. Our young people should be able to move forward and specialise by completing training which will ensure that they keep up with the employment market. Finally, the fight against unemployment not only entails doing everything to improve the employment situation in Europe, but also in combating poverty. The professional integration of people who have been out of work for a long time is vital in the fight against poverty. The European Social Fund is the instrument which can help bring these people back to the labour market. Let us start by giving these people their dignity back, by giving them jobs, and let us avoid helping them with no prospect of social integration. I would stress this point. Pascale Gruny,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Iturgaiz Angulo on his work. I agree with the content of the report, and do not wish to return to that particular subject. However, I would like to stress two important issues raised by Mr Iturgaiz Angulo. First of all, it is important to inform the citizens of the difference between the citizens’ initiative, the process of submitting a petition to the European Parliament, and the role of the European Ombudsman. There is still too much confusion regarding the role of each instrument. Secondly, when I go to meet citizens in my constituency, I realise that they have never heard of the right to submit a petition to the European Parliament. How can we ensure that the citizens have a clearer picture and that they are able to mobilise existing resources to their advantage? In view of this, it is vitally important for the European Parliament to possess better communication tools. Are you aware that no website currently exists to clearly explain how to submit a petition? By the same token, there is no information available to people submitting petitions which would allow them to follow, in real time, the progress of their petitions to Parliament. There is no good reason for this lack of transparency. A greater level of visibility is needed so that the citizens become aware of the fact that we are there to support them. Our committee exists and works for their benefit, and we are there to listen to them. The European Parliament must do everything within its power to close this communication gap and to highlight the work that has been carried out. This work is not of a legislative nature, that is true, but it is no less important. The citizens should be our main concern, and our committee works towards this objective each and every day. Pascale Gruny,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is only one lesson to be learned here, namely, that full-time contracts of an indefinite duration must remain the norm. First of all, I would like to thank all the colleagues who contributed to the drawing up of this report. Today, I am disappointed that a debate has not been held on a matter which lies at the heart of the 2020 strategy. A number of my colleagues wished to speak on the subject, but were not given the opportunity to do so. Nevertheless, I would strongly encourage them to submit their contributions, in written form, to Parliament’s services. I am also disappointed that, having worked closely with all the political groups to achieve an agreement after numerous consultations, an alternative resolution, which is almost identical to my report, has been tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. My group cannot support the two elements which Mrs Schroedter has added to the alternative resolution, and which the Committee had rejected in a vote. First of all, with regard to the basis of these proposals, which concern, above all, ‘false’ self-employed persons: it is true that these are a real, widespread problem. As the report mentions, we would like a better definition of self-employed persons, but we must also ensure that the criterion pertaining to non self-employed persons is clearly defined, rather than relying on the presumption of employee status. The definition proposed by the Greens is much more vague and does not provide any added value to the text adopted by the Committee. Secondly, with regard to the call for a directive to guarantee the same rights to all workers, including the right to freedom of association, irrespective of their professional status; I do not quite understand exactly to what rights this refers, or who is preventing employees or self-employed persons from joining or forming a union. In my opinion, it is pointless to call for such a directive, and the matter falls outside of the European institutions’ sphere of competence. In my report, I wanted to make full-time contracts of an indefinite duration the norm and condemn the exploitative replacement of regular jobs with atypical contracts. I would like to remind you that the principle of flexicurity implies not only flexibility, in order to adapt to the demands of the labour market but, above all, it also refers to job security, and the one principle cannot be implemented at the expense of the other. The European Union must intensify its efforts to invest in skills and training in order to support sustainable employment. The unemployment rate remains far too high in the European Union, and atypical contracts therefore do have a role to play on the labour market. With regard to young people, atypical contracts could, for example, provide them with their first experience of the labour market. If atypical contracts could provide young people with an opportunity, and make it easier for them to become salaried employees with contracts of an indefinite duration, then I would support these kinds of contracts. With regard to people who face a long period of unemployment, once again, if an atypical contract facilitates their transition back onto the labour market, then I am in favour of this kind of contract. Finally, if an atypical contract is used in the context of moving from one job to another or from one professional status to another, then, once again, I would support this kind of contract, as the main aim is to keep people in employment. I would also stress the vital role played by the social partners and civil society organisations in the drawing up and implementation of employment policies. I call on all the Member States to ensure their full participation, as all too often, their level of involvement varies from one Member State to another. Finally, we must ensure that they enjoy an improved level of recognition, at both social and institutional level. In this report, the European Parliament is sending out a strong signal to the governments of the Member States and to the Commission. Secure career paths are an essential aspect of a social Europe. The ball is now in the European Council’s court. I hope that the Council will stand by its resolutions in the field of employment, adopted in the spring of 2010. The European Union needs a clear focus and specific measures to protect employment in our regions and to create new opportunities, within the framework of the 2020 strategy. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 The directive that we are debating today is the fruit of very lengthy negotiations in the European Parliament over two mandates. This is a very sensitive issue, as it concerns our jobs both today and in the future. It is a matter of road safety and of fair competition between companies in the Member States. I would not accept social dumping within our Union itself. Could an independent driver work 14 hours a day, 84 hours a week, and not be a risk on the roads? Compared with a company-employed driver, this is unfair competition. This also leads some companies to suggest to their employees that they declare themselves self-employed. We must protect our fellow citizens and our companies. I therefore invite the European Commission to withdraw its proposal and, failing that, I call on MEPs, during tomorrow’s vote in plenary, to vote in favour of keeping self-employed workers within the scope of working time legislation. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the European Parliament is sending out a strong message to women who assist their spouses in their self-employed work. From now on, their social rights will be considerably enhanced, and I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, on the work she has done. Europe must protect. Under the new definition of ‘assisting spouse’, spouses and partners will be eligible for social protection in the event of sickness or retirement. Bakers’ spouses will now be able to benefit from social rights. It is regrettable, however, that the Council did not agree to compulsory membership, but simply adopted the system of voluntary membership. Maternity leave is also provided for all women. The new text provides for a minimum period of maternity leave for self-employed women and wives of self-employed workers throughout the European Union. The duration of this leave is currently set at 14 weeks. I am the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for the directive on the health and safety at work of pregnant workers. I sincerely hope that, with the adoption of this text, the duration of maternity leave will be increased; and why not subsequently increase it for self-employed women? To conclude, Europe has proposed some creative and pragmatic solutions to help couples to reconcile professional and family life. It is now time to switch to taking action and to implement the proposals as quickly as possible. Europe’s campaign to protect women is making headway with this text. However, we MEPs must continue to eliminate the inequalities between men and women. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all in agreement today in welcoming the measures to simplify the awarding of the Structural Funds proposed in Mr Kirilov’s report. Nevertheless, as Chair of Parliament’s Work Group on the European Social Fund, I am indignant at how long the review procedure that is currently in progress has taken. The Commission’s initial proposal dates from June 2009. Even though the purpose of this review was to help Member States combat the economic and social crisis, it took the Council six months to reach an agreement. That is unacceptable. It is true that the legislative procedure has been modified along the way to give Parliament the same amount of power as the Council. However, as the elected representatives of the European Union, we cannot today justify these delays to the public. I will now make a brief digression to welcome the responsibility shown by Parliament in agreeing as far as possible on the Council’s position in order not to delay the procedure any further. However, I would like to express my disappointment once again. We need a European Union that can take swift decisions that have a real impact on the ground. Now let us turn to the future for a moment. The simplification measures proposed today to combat the economic crisis are positive, but I would like to add that they could have been even more ambitious if the measures being applied to the current programming period, 2007-2013, had not been so clumsy and complicated. Therefore, looking ahead to the negotiations for the multiannual legislative framework for 2014-2020, I call on the European Parliament to demonstrate boldness in its proposals for the simplification of the administration and application of the Structural and Cohesion Funds. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the new online problem-solving network concerning cases of misapplication of internal market law, known as SOLVIT, is a very successful system insofar as it provides redress, without formal procedures, within approximately 10 weeks. Created in 2002, this network saw its workload increase by 22% in 2008. Even though the resolution rate remains quite high at 83%, the number of cases resolved is decreasing. It would seem to be time, eight years after it was created, to think about strengthening this institution by giving it the means to function effectively. These new measures would make it possible to help European citizens and businesses to assert their rights, especially with regard to the recognition of qualifications and of their social and residence entitlements. I therefore support the idea that not only should there be more SOLVIT staff in the Member States, but also that support and training measures should be put in place so that staff can function as efficiently as possible. It seems essential to me that governments and we ourselves, as elected representatives for our respective constituencies, should promote the SOLVIT network, which enabled cost savings of EUR 32.6 million in 2008. Furthermore, promoting this new tool would limit excessive recourse to the judicial system. I therefore call on the Member States to transpose all the European directives and make citizens and businesses aware of their rights within the internal market through national forms of media and information campaigns. To conclude, on behalf of my political group within the Committee on Petitions, I hope that cooperation between SOLVIT and our parliamentary committee will be strengthened so as to facilitate the work of these two bodies.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done, and our fellow Members for their hard work in creating this new microfinance instrument. This European instrument will make it possible to grant micro-credits to small enterprises and to people who have lost their jobs and want to set up their own small businesses. In this time of financial crisis, the most vulnerable people, especially the unemployed and young people, have been the worst affected. In fact, over 3.5 million job losses have been recorded this year in the European Union. The adoption of this new tool will make it easier for these people to access the capital required to set up or develop a business and make their dreams of entrepreneurship come true. We should not forget that over a third of micro-enterprises are created by unemployed people. In my region, I am often approached by citizens wishing to obtain aid to set up their own business. I am convinced that this new initiative will bear fruit in preserving jobs and that it will create new jobs too. The proposal will facilitate investments of low sums and will give micro-enterprises an opportunity to grow. Madam President, I would like to welcome the real added value of micro-credits, which will go hand in hand with new support measures, such as training and mentoring, which will enable the youngest people and the unemployed to obtain guarantees and assistance for their investment plans. I hope that this new instrument to promote employment will be adopted as soon as possible and that an agreement will be reached between Parliament and the Council on making this tool, which is vital for our fellow citizens, and particularly so during this crisis period, a permanent one. Ladies and gentlemen, let us not forget that it is small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every day in Europe, one in five women is a victim of violence. Violence against women is unacceptable, irrespective of the form it takes. Yet, in Europe, many women and young girls continue to live in the shadow of aggression or exploitation. The figures are alarming. Violence against women comes in many forms and occurs everywhere: domestic violence at home, sexual abuse, sexual harassment at work, rape, including within relationships, and also as a tactic of warfare outside Europe. In Europe, domestic violence is the main cause of death and disability among women between the ages of 16 and 44. As we debate these extremely serious matters, women are being assaulted. Talking about it is not enough. It is time for action. The European Union has a duty to protect its most vulnerable citizens. Fighting violence against women is a battle for fundamental human rights, and the Daphne Programme, which supports actions aimed at combating all forms of violence, is insufficient. New measures must be considered for the development of consistent European plans. I support the initiative of organising a European Year to combat violence against women, which our institution has been calling for now for more than a decade. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will not repeat all of the key points made by my fellow Members in relation to justice and immigration, but I did wish to point out that a European judicial area can only be established by enhancing mutual confidence among Member States, since that will improve the principle of mutual recognition, the cornerstone of the Europe of justice. Considerable progress has been made over the last 15 years, but there are still many weaknesses. I am delighted that the Treaty of Lisbon was finally ratified by all of the Member States during the negotiation of this text. The European Parliament will be able to have an equal say with the Council on matters relating to justice and home affairs; democratic legitimacy will be increased for the benefit of the citizens. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, I should like to stress that far too many complaints are referred to the Committee on Petitions concerning barriers to the freedom of movement of citizens within the European Union itself. I would also mention the problems linked to the mutual recognition of qualifications and to the right to social welfare benefits, as well as discrimination problems. The recognition of same-sex marriages, on the other hand, is an area that comes under the jurisdiction of the Member States. The Union must respect this national competence. I call on the European Commission to publish its guidelines as soon as possible so as to help the Member States’ authorities effectively combat breaches of the principle of free movement. Citizens must be able to move freely and to make full use of their rights in this area without internal borders. I am delighted to see that, in the resolution, the European Union’s anti-drug strategy has a place in the creation of this European judicial area. However, I hope that the European Union will show more initiative in this regard. Why does the Union not equip itself with new weapons for combating this growing trend, which affects our children at an increasingly early age? They are the future. What are we doing to protect them? Let us finally show some sense of pragmatism in our institutions! That is what our fellow citizens expect from us. Pascale Gruny,

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), to congratulate the rapporteur most sincerely on the work she has done and on the spirit of cooperation she has shown throughout the process of drafting this report. We are giving our verdict today on the annual report on the European Ombudsman’s activities, which was presented on 21 April. Appointed by the European Parliament, the Ombudsman gives us a formal account, via this report, of all the results of his inquiries into complaints concerning cases of maladministration within our European institutions and agencies. His role, which is of the utmost importance, represents an essential guarantee that the principles of transparency and good administration will be respected and therefore constitutes a genuine form of protection for our fellow citizens in cases of injustice, discrimination, abuses of power, outstanding responses and delayed information. Indeed, in this report we note the increasing number of complaints lodged with the Ombudsman. The majority concern the European Commission, the institution that, admittedly, comprises the largest number of officials, but essentially, they are cases of an alleged lack of transparency. The fact remains that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. Coming back to the report, the Committee on Petitions approved it by a large majority on 1 October. Our Ombudsman has carried out his job of examining and processing the complaints in an active and balanced way. In particular, he has always been able to maintain good relations with and between the institutions, which has helped the institutions and agencies in question to accept an amicable solution or to settle certain disputes, with a few exceptions. Moreover, the Ombudsman serves as a resource for the institutions. He helps them to improve their performance by drawing their attention to areas for improvement, the ultimate goal being to improve the service to be provided to our fellow citizens. The report that we have adopted in committee underlines and points out the importance of the adoption of a code of good administrative behaviour by all of the European institutions and agencies, a code that was already approved by the European Parliament eight years ago. This repeated call by our committee must not remain unanswered. Europeans deserve nothing less. The right to good administration by the institutions and bodies of the European Union is a fundamental right laid down in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union included in Part II of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is no longer a fantasy but a reality. Lastly, I feel the need to point out that the Ombudsman reserves the right to scrutinise the work of the Commission and must ensure that the latter makes proper use of its discretionary power to start infringement proceedings or to propose sanctions.

The state of the dairy market has worsened considerably over the last 12 months: the price of milk has fallen by 30% in a year, which is the sharpest fall seen in the last 20 years. We therefore urgently need to introduce new forms of regulation at European level to ensure that the dairy sector is not just dependent on the rules of the market but can actually prove a match for them. Currently, the instability in producers’ incomes does not allow the best allocation to be made of resources that are vital for future investments in the sector. Therefore, the European Commission has a duty to facilitate contractual relations within the agri-food chain, so as to balance the relations between the various operators in the sector, stabilise the markets and prevent market risks. It must also encourage better organisation within the sectors. In addition, consideration should be given to whether an increase in milk quotas might have a positive impact on producer prices. Europe must act now. We can wait no longer. If we do not act, we will run the risk of seeing the European dairy sector suffer lasting damage, thus depriving our fragile rural areas of the hub of their economies.Arnaud Danjean,

Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to list today all of the crises and threats that affect our security and the stability of our continent and its neighbours. Every day – as we have just heard – we hear new reasons that lead us to believe that this multipolar world at the start of the 21st
 century is in many regards more dangerous than the world we had become used to because it is less predictable and less organised: civil war in Syria, Israeli-Arab tensions, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, clashes and crime in the Sahel, piracy off the coast of Somalia and continued fighting in Congo, to list just today’s dangers. In light of this situation, it would be irresponsible to think of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) as a luxury or a bit of an aside. It is a policy that is undoubtedly recent and still being formed. More than any other policy at EU level, it is a policy that is based on the Member States, on their material and human capacities, on their traditions and on their political desire to share, or not, as the case may be, their almost absolute sovereignty in diplomatic and military matters. This leads too many observers – and too many Members here – to believe that the CSDP is negligible or a pointless illusion. On the contrary, we believe – without any naivety or excess illusions – that the CSDP is a strategic necessity for the European Union. That is also why it appears in full in the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Union simply cannot continue just to systematically delegate its security and that of its neighbours. Of course, NATO, which brings together 21 of the 27 Member States, is still the cornerstone of the continent’s common defence, and we should be pleased about that. In addition, we must reaffirm the transatlantic partnership, which is irreplaceable, but it does not exclude efforts and ambitions on the part of the European countries themselves; on the contrary. Indeed, the United States, which has begun a real strategic shift towards Asia and the Pacific is calling on us in Europe to be more active, more robust, more sure of ourselves when it comes to security and defence. Those who call into question the CSDP and say that it duplicates work must realise that it offers pragmatic and intelligent complementarity when it comes to NATO, a military organisation, and the European Union. There are some crises that affect our security and in which NATO cannot intervene; Georgia was one example, and the same applies generally to the African conflicts, where the United States does not feel obliged to intervene, as we saw with the recent example of Libya. Unfortunately, these examples could increase in the future. Action by the European Union is often completely legitimate because its actions comply fully with international law, and there are few third countries that do not acknowledge its balanced role without any ambiguous, unilateral ambitions. It has many ways to act; it has the excellent civilian/military global approach and it is the only body to have this. All too often, unfortunately, what we are missing is political will – above all, on the part of the Member States: a lack of political will – and we have to emphasise this, too – or motivation on the part of certain Brussels institutions that are in charge of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the CSDP, a lack of vision at times, a reluctance to act in the Council, an ideological reluctance because we believe that soft power is more effective that the use of an armed force, and an absence of clear priorities that, too often, give the impression that we are making it up as we go along. The strategic challenges that we face are enormous and unprecedented: a structural and sustainable reduction in the defence budgets of European countries, the reorientation of US priorities, volatility and an extremely diverse range of threats. Therefore, the Member States either have to undergo a major and collective strategic downgrade, or pick themselves up and exploit as best they can, the potential of the CSDP, modest as it still may be. There is no doubt that most of our efforts today should focus on capacity-building, and in this regard we emphasise in the report the virtues of the pooling and sharing initiative promoted by the European Defence Agency, which is a step in the right direction. The economic and strategic crises must not be used as an excuse – and this is important, Mr President – to turn our backs, but should instead be an opportunity to strengthen our common ambition. (Applause) Arnaud Danjean,

Mr President, I would like to thank all of my colleagues who were involved in the preparation of this report in all of their groups. It is very pleasing to see such a broad consensus that the European Union has to equip itself with the means to achieve a global, international ambition, including a security and defence policy. Like the Minister, I am sorry that our British colleagues still have a very ideological and completely unpragmatic position, which is reflected in their actions. They have spoken here as the representatives of a great military nation, but they should not be under any illusions. That great military nation is also going to suffer, and is already suffering, a considerable strategic decline, with defence budget cuts, and problems with materials and human resources, like all European countries. Of course, NATO is our last resource, but NATO will not be able to intervene always and everywhere to defend European interests. Some Member States are not members of NATO. Some NATO countries will not always be prepared to defend European interests. We have to face up to that possibility. The European Union must therefore maintain a form of autonomy, which is not rivalry, competition or duplication, but intelligent complementarity. That is already the case across all of the European Union’s missions: more than a dozen missions are being carried out successfully today and are expected – and this is the most important aspect – by the countries that are in crisis. They recognise the European Union’s legitimacy and, undoubtedly, they would not be prepared to do that for any other international actor. We must be proud of that and we must restate this ambition. I hope that the relatively strong vote tomorrow in favour of this report will help the High Representative and the Council to forge ahead. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, the free and exemplary elections that took place in Georgia, which we had the privilege of observing with some of our colleagues, have resulted in democratic change in that country, which is a great privilege in the region.  The irony, of course, is that those who won the election, and we must congratulate them, are also those who during the campaign complained about a dictatorship run by criminals. We can only hope now that these new leaders will be somewhat wiser and reasonable in government than they were at times during the campaign. The European Union – as you did so successfully during your first trip to Tbilisi, it has to be said – must, without any paranoia or naivety, pay close attention to what happens in Georgia and judge the new authorities on their actions and their results, not just their declared intentions. It must also remain vigilant and remind those authorities that a change is not the same as revenge. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we are all aware of the extent of your task and the difficulties involved in coordinating the Member States, which are highly sensitive about their diplomatic and military prerogatives. That requires us to be somewhat lenient and to recognise willingly that you do not spare any efforts. Nevertheless, it is impossible for us today not to express a degree of disappointment or even frustration, and this is clearly expressed in the Brok report, which underlines the lack of any clear sense of strategic priorities for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). Your commendable objective is the implementation of the comprehensive approach, which should give the European Union added value on the international stage. However, I must admit that the approach seems, above all, to be global in its dimension and, I was going to say, in its geographical scope. If we want to be everywhere, all the time, one sometimes wonders what the European Union actually does and where it really exercises successful global capabilities. You rightly mentioned the Horn of Africa; it is true that the EU is putting all of its resources, including its military resources, to work there, and it is still a success, but a limited success. The CFSP really has to get away from the fragmented, divided initiatives that take shape in response to emergencies and new situations and which concentrate on a hierarchy of priorities and truly coherent mobilisation of all of its instruments.

Mr President, I must say I am quite surprised to see Georgia being discussed today. Sure, as has been pointed out, there are visits by eminent public figures. Sure, there are elections to be held in October. However, this is not the only country where there are important visits and elections. We all know why we are talking about Georgia today. We are talking about Georgia today because a certain oligarch has decided to take part in the elections – which is his right - and because he has flooded the coffers of lobbyists in Washington and Brussels with dollars and euros, which has obviously paid off as we have placed Georgia on our agenda, not to talk about the Russian occupation, or about Russia’s violation of cease-fire agreements or about Russian military manoeuvres during October, in the midst of elections, but about the electoral process in Georgia. You have pointed out a number of resolutions in which we voted for an independent civil society, for a strong and credible opposition. An oligarch’s millions of dollars do not make a strong and credible opposition, nor do they create an independent civil society. Of course, we should not be giving a blank cheque to Mr Saakashvili. Yet I think that giving a blank cheque to this oligarch who has gone into politics is much more dangerous. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the resolution on the upcoming presidential elections in Russia, to be held on 4 March 2012, and on the controversial outcome of the legislative elections of 4 December 2011. With this text, we wanted to condemn the lack of transparency and impartiality of the Russian electoral system, prone to multiple cases of fraud, the lack of neutrality of the media, and the convergence of the state and the governing party. The aim of this resolution is therefore to express the EU’s concerns with regard to the situation of human rights and the rule of law in Russia. We urge Russia to hold free and democratic elections, and to punish those responsible for all forms of fraud and intimidation. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 I voted in favour of maintaining the funds of the European Programme of food aid for the most deprived (PEAD) for two additional years (2012 and 2013). Indeed, it is our responsibility to ensure the survival of such a programme, which has helped more than 18 million deprived people in 19 Member States of the European Union since 1987 (under the CAP). This programme will therefore continue to supply food to numerous charities working to eradicate hunger, with an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million. At present, our new fight, in which I wish to be fully engaged, is to ensure the long-term sustainability of this important solidarity programme by guaranteeing its funding beyond 2013.

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation on contractual relations in the milk sector. In effect, the report is, largely, a response to the terrible crisis that afflicted the milk sector in 2008-2010, when prices paid to producers collapsed dramatically. Furthermore, it looks to prepare dairy producers for the expiry of dairy quotas in 2015. In this way, it aims to increase the bargaining power of dairy producers in order to ensure that they receive fairer prices for their products, without encroaching on the right to competition. In order to do this, the new regulation permits, amongst others things, dairy producers to be able to join producer organisations so that they can gain real clout against processors as well as ensuring fairer distribution of added value along the supply chain. In the long term, this approach aims to provide a fairer standard of living for dairy producers. Today, therefore, I urge dairy producers to fully embrace the new tools established by European legislation, so that they may help further their interests, find their place in the market and prepare themselves for the ‘post-quota era’.

 Mr President, the situation in Syria is currently the most serious and painful challenge facing the international community. Bombarding your own people with heavy artillery, imprisoning and torturing civilians, including children: these are things that we cannot tolerate and which bear witness to the blindness of a criminal regime. It is easy to become indignant and to condemn; it is harder to act, and to act effectively. Once we exclude – properly I believe – the possibility of military intervention as in Libya, we should recognise that our scope for action is very limited. There are, however, ways to contribute to the further isolation of this regime, an isolation that is, as Mr Brok emphasised, without doubt, the most realistic way forward. First of all, sanctions, on which the EU has taken the lead. These must be reinforced as much as possible, and they are a useful course of action. In the key area of diplomacy, we must first condemn the unchallengeable Russian and Chinese vetoes and we must, above all, make these countries realise that such vetoes are not only unacceptable, they are also incomprehensible and are a dead end for those countries themselves. The Arab League is taking initiatives; it is playing a major role which is to be welcomed and which ought to be supported and strengthened, even if all of the options that it presents are unrealisable in the short term. These initiatives have the immense merit of being in existence and of being widely adopted by responsible countries. Beyond the political need to apply maximum pressure on the Syrian regime and those who support it, like Iran and Russia, there is also a humanitarian emergency. The demand for unconditional, immediate access to the victims has no need of a UN resolution; it is an absolute moral duty. The EU and its Member States must bring all of their weight to bear to push forward the Arab League‘s initiatives and bring an end to the scandal of this repression from another age. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Mr President, the excellent report by our colleague, Mr Lisek, highlights the main constraint affecting national and multilateral defence efforts, now and in the future, namely, budgetary restraint. European countries will also be affected by another strategic constraint: the attitude of our US friends and allies, who are no longer willing or able to do everything for us where security is concerned. The Libyan case illustrated this point well. Therefore, in this very restrictive context, we must revive the ambition for a common security and defence policy which is strong on operations and capabilities. In terms of operations, Baroness Ashton, you talk at length – and rightly so – about this famous comprehensive approach that undoubtedly only the European Union has the power to promote in terms of the main international crises. We still need to ensure – and this is your role – that this comprehensive approach does not sacrifice security elements and, where appropriate, military elements. It must be truly comprehensive, without watering down this security aspect. That is the positive message you have given us through the Sahel and Horn of Africa strategies, and I welcome it. In terms of capabilities, we must, of course, welcome the European Defence Agency’s role, even if there are unfortunately still some restrictions on its budget. I would be grateful if you could make your assessment of the European Defence Agency’s efforts known. When talking about the defence industry, we must also remember that strengthening and supporting our European defence industries – obviously without forgetting to rationalise them – also supports jobs and technologies that extend far beyond the defence sector alone and which are of huge strategic importance to our economies, particularly during times of crisis.

 Madam President, I hope that the resolution on Libya that we will be voting on tomorrow, and on which there is broad agreement, will be just as relevant as the resolution that we approved here six months ago, where the bulk of the provisions have proved perfectly reasonable. The condemnation and sanctions aimed at the Gaddafi regime, the introduction of the principle of the duty to protect civilian populations, if necessary through recourse to military force, and the recognition of the legitimacy of the National Transitional Council: all of these provisions were approved here before they were ever discussed in the European Council or implemented by the Member States. They form the backbone of the action taken by the international community. We should honour all those countries, particularly the European countries, of which there are many, that have been steadfastly committed to supporting the Libyan people’s desire for freedom through both diplomatic and military means. I feel that it is also important to pay tribute to the French pilots who, on 19 March, wiped out the columns of Colonel Gaddafi’s troops that were marching on Benghazi, thereby preventing the town from being added to the roll-call of ravaged towns mourned by Europe, such as Vukovar and Srebrenica. Six months on, obviously we need to avoid unwarranted optimism, because although Colonel Gaddafi’s reign has come to an end, the conflict itself has not, and also because the challenges associated with the embryonic transition are massive and far from resolved. The European Union therefore needs to act now by taking a leading role in this delicate phase. We need to work with other international players to offer prompt assistance and support that go beyond the humanitarian efforts that have already been made and that focus primarily on supporting civil movements, establishing institutions and organising the security sector. First and foremost, these concerted efforts must be based on one clear principle, namely that this transition must be guided by the Libyans themselves and that no one, albeit with the best intentions in the world, can take the place of the Libyan people’s hopes for independence. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, on behalf of the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to congratulate you on your presentation of this very ambitious programme. You mentioned, with good reason, the external crises and the need to ensure the security and defence of the European Union, and were right to do so. While the Libyan crisis has, unfortunately, once again reminded us of and illustrated the difficulties the European Union faces in existing as such, in the international arena, we are pleased that the Polish Presidency has the courage to take on this debate. It should be emphatically noted that the common security and defence policy is not a secondary option, but rather it is a necessity. It is, firstly, an aim which is enshrined in the Treaty and is thus binding on the Member States and European institutions. It is also a strategic necessity; every day, with all the crises and threats all around us, we are finding that our US friends and allies cannot and do not want to do everything on our behalf. Lastly, it is an economic imperative at a time of budgetary restraint. Defence has a cost which many of our citizens consider exorbitant. To maintain our defence capabilities, as well as our industries, our expertise and our jobs, we must collectively streamline our defence budgets. The Member States must accept their responsibilities, but the European Union institutions – and I am thinking here of the High Representative and the External Action Service – should function more as a source of initiatives, and we are counting on the Polish Presidency to stimulate these initiatives. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the Libyan crisis has, unfortunately, once again illustrated the European Union’s difficulties in existing diplomatically and militarily. However, it would be most unfair to blame you solely for the lack of political will displayed by the Union, even if many of us believe that more decisive action could have been and should have been taken. It is also true that the Member States bear a great deal of responsibility for this inability to come up with a coherent, effective and visible policy on this matter, while our US friends relied heavily on Europe to act. The Libyan crisis aside, however, we must be mindful of the major strategic developments that mean that we must not give up on the ambition of a common security and defence policy, as enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, and which you, Baroness Ashton, must continue to inspire, support and speak up for. Taken together, the unprecedented fiscal constraints on defence budgets, the many international crises and the United States’ strategic redeployment are significant factors that leave us no choice but to take our destiny into our own hands. Faced with these many crises and threats, we cannot just hand over the keys to our US friends and allies or to NATO. Neither the United States nor NATO was able to end the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, for example, and nor can the United States or NATO observe the current ceasefire there. It is the European mission that has full legitimacy. We can clearly see in Libya that the United States did not want to be in the front line and that NATO’s minimum undertaking is insufficient. Baroness Ashton, the common security and defence policy is not just something achieved over 10 years or just an ambition enshrined in the Treaties. It is also a strategic requirement, and you must be at the forefront taking the necessary initiatives. (Applause) Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you emphasised – and we are all aware of this – the urgent need to take action in response to the Libyan crisis. You rightly pointed out what the European Union has done and has done rather well in humanitarian terms and in terms of the evacuation of European citizens. Indeed, I think that the European Union would have gained from publicising these actions and making them much more visible, because people too often have the impression that the Member States alone carry out these operations, whereas you have pointed out that European mechanisms have worked here. On a political and military level now, a reminder of the need for a no-fly zone is certainly necessary, if not just politically, then also militarily. It will take more than that, however, because – let us not forget – no-fly zones did not prevent atrocities on the ground in Bosnia and Kosovo, even when, in the case of overflying, they were applied very rigorously. While we await the UN Security Council’s decisions, we have European common security and defence policy instruments. We can implement them for the purposes of maritime surveillance, monitoring the embargo and delivering humanitarian aid. Europe has to make its voice heard on this point, and you have the instruments with which to act. Arnaud Danjean,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the subject we are dealing with today is one that we ought to have begun looking at many months ago, given that the security situation in the Sahel region has been steadily deteriorating for over three years now. Furthermore, we are dealing with the subject in a week in which we in France have buried two innocent young victims of Islamic terrorism, who were killed on the Niger-Mali border a few weeks ago. Aside from the intense feelings that these crimes arouse, we need to recognise the real threats concentrated in this region on Europe’s doorstep, as the threat is not only from terrorism, even though the kidnappings and murders are the most dramatic manifestation of the deteriorating situation in Mauritania, Mali and Niger. Criminal networks are rife. Trafficking in drugs, arms and human beings is threatening the stability of these countries, but also that of our own continent. For make no mistake, in the same way that the majority of the victims of the terrorist acts in this region are European citizens, Europe is also the destination for this trafficking. In the face of this extremely worrying situation, the European Union should put in place an integrated, comprehensive strategy to combine its development and security policies. This is absolutely vital. There are initiatives already in place of course, via the tenth European Development Fund (EDF) in particular, and almost EUR 2 billion have been set aside for these countries for combating poverty, developing the economy and establishing more effective governance. Certain Member States have bilateral cooperation policies, too, of course. However, we now need to go much further. In particular, our action needs to be much more coordinated. We need to strengthen the regional approach and encourage these countries to work together more to deal with the common challenges they face. We also need to expand the range of policies at the EU’s disposal and integrate them as much as possible, in the areas of development, security, strengthening institutional structures, customs, the courts and the police. Baroness Ashton, there are few regions so close to Europe that harbour so many threats to our security and there are few regions in which the EU can at last put into practice the integrated approach envisaged in the Treaty of Lisbon, on the basis of which the European External Action Service which you currently head was formed. Baroness Ashton, please can you give us some details about the strategy that you intend to implement in this region? Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Madam President, to correct what has been said, Mr Arlacchi is quite right, the final text proposed to us no longer contains, in Recital B, the words ‘occupation force’. Quite simply, the translations, and particularly the French translation, were not correct in the latest version, and the French translation, until this morning, still contained the expression ‘occupation force’, hence the speech by my colleague Mr Juvin. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I share your opinion on the Lisbon Summit which has come up with a new strategic concept which is satisfactory overall. However, we should nonetheless recognise, in all honesty, that the poor relation of this text is, in view of the potential of this strategic partnership, the European Union-NATO relationship, which should be a great deal more ambitious. You rightly noted the successes and progress of capability development. You noted successes, obviously, in the case of Afghanistan, where we are managing to reach compromises on the ground. However, it is unsatisfactory that we do not have a structured political dialogue with NATO, apart from the single case of Bosnia We all know that the problem is that of Turkey. We are going to have to deal with it seriously, no doubt pragmatically, and I hope that the efforts you are making with Secretary General Rasmussen will bear fruit. I briefly want to say that the problem of duplication is often advanced to highlight the weaknesses of the European Union and to limit the European Union’s aspiration to be ambitious. This is a false problem because there are not two armies in our Member States, a NATO army and a European Union army. There is an armed force in each country and it is up to the country to choose whether to place its troops under the NATO banner or the European Union banner. Let us stop scaremongering with this notion of duplication. I would like to say a word about complementarity: it is essential and must be applied intelligently. I would not want to see complementarity becoming an imperative with the European Union becoming the Red Cross of what would be a NATO armed force. The European Union must keep its military capabilities, hold onto its military ambitions and must retain its ambition in the case of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) as was pointed out in the tripartite Franco-German and Polish letter. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, I will make three brief points on this subject. Firstly, as the issue at stake was France’s position regarding the sale of the Mistral, may I remind you that no firm agreement has been reached, that the Mistral is a vessel, a ship that would be sold unarmed – which is really one of the fundamental issues at the heart of talks with Russia – and that Russia has not only entered into negotiations with France to purchase this type of equipment. So, allow me to put things into perspective. I realise that there is a great deal of emotion in some countries, but emotion is one thing, the facts are quite another. Secondly, as you pointed out, Minister, we have within the European Union a code of conduct for arms exports that became a common position under the French Presidency in 2008; this code of conduct is one of the most demanding in the world. We are above exemplary on the matter, and we have, in addition to this code of conduct, as one of our fellow Members reminded us, a group that meets on a regular basis as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy to discuss not only the implementation of this code but also Member States’ national policies on arms exports. There are, therefore, forums in which the Mistral issue can be dealt with quite adequately. Lastly, allow me to say that, if we are talking about European solidarity on arms exports and if we are looking at the need to have a common strategy and a common defence policy, we need to look at the entire cycle of trade in arms and defence equipment. That also involves imports and obviously the defence industry. From that point of view, I believe that many countries also have a long way to go to ensure that Europe can maintain technologies, jobs, know-how and a real strategic capacity in our military deployments. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I should like to express the unequivocal support of the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and our unequivocal support for the very fine compromise negotiated by Mr Brok, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Gualtieri. Indeed, this is an important milestone in the creation of a common European policy in areas as sensitive as foreign affairs, security and defence. Every day, from Georgia to the coasts of Somalia, from the Balkans to Gaza, we can clearly see how much this common policy is needed and also – I was going to say above all – how much our citizens want it. Because, above and beyond the interinstitutional powers which we are welcoming today in this compromise and, in particular, the increased role given to Parliament, we must clearly emphasise the strategic opportunity represented by this External Action Service, which is an essential tool for equipping the EU with a more ambitious, more consistent, more credible and more effective common foreign and security policy. Baroness Ashton, may I say to you, as Chair of Parliament’s Subcommittee on Security and Defence and also, to some extent, as a Frenchman, that I insist on the particular responsibility which you will have to exercise, that of crisis management, by preserving and strengthening the EU’s unique character and added value, in other words, its civil-military capabilities – the two words go together. You are the one who will be responsible for ensuring that the EU maintains and increases its capabilities by rejecting the ill-founded suspicions that are voiced here and there – and indeed sometimes in this Chamber – to the effect that the service will be militarised, and by joining with Parliament as much as possible in clearly affirming the legitimacy of any operations conducted by the EU in crisis locations. Arnaud Danjean,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy that we are presenting today is an annual document by Parliament that provides a kind of interim assessment of the European Security and Defence Policy and submits proposals aimed at improving the effectiveness and visibility of that policy. This year, this report lies within a very specific context, and thus it should become a force for proposals. This specific context is characterised by the combination of three major cycles. The first concerns the 10 years of the European Security and Defence Policy, which we celebrated at the end of 2009. The last 10 years showed that Europe was able to conduct civil and military operations at the scene of more than 23 crises. That fundamental achievement can be built on further. It shows that there is a demand for Europe and that the Union has the institutional­political and operational ability to rise to these challenges. The second important cycle is, of course – and Mr Albertini mentioned it a moment ago – the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. The change in terms of security and defence goes far beyond a strict semantic adjustment. Indeed, the ESDP becomes the Common Security and Defence Policy, the CSDP, and it must take on a new dimension. The Treaty has enriched the range of tools and the scope of security and defence policy, particularly with the inclusion of assistance clauses, of solidarity clauses, with permanent structured cooperation and, above all, with the creation of the European External Action Service and of your role as High Representative, Vice-President of the Commission. Lastly, the third major event that characterises the context in which this report was drafted is that NATO which, for 21 of the 27 members of the Union, is still the main reference point where the collective security of the European continent is concerned, is currently revising its strategic concept and that this assessment by NATO should also lead us, the Union, to define more clearly the conditions of this partnership, which remains fundamental. In this context, the report’s objective is less about persisting with a doctrine than about providing you with a necessarily evolving roadmap, for all the new institutions that are being established and that must learn to work together. The aim is to make the Union more credible, more effective and more visible in security and defence terms. In this regard, the European Parliament absolutely must be given a greater degree of responsibility in these sensitive areas if a policy of which the main aim is to guarantee the security of European citizens is to be fully legitimate. With this report, we wanted to stress the following points. Firstly, we wanted to point out that, above all, the European Security and Defence Strategy and the Common Security and Defence Policy are there to serve the people of Europe, to guarantee and improve their security. This political ambition is not superfluous; it is not for appearances’ sake. It corresponds to a need for our continent to strive to ensure its own security but also to contribute to the stability of the world around us, to tackle the crises and the threats that are developing in our environment. Beyond the traditional armed conflicts that continue to take place in our immediate environment, Europe must be able to express its interests and defend them in the face of the new threats – I am thinking in particular of piracy and cybercrime. We also felt it important to stress just how unequalled Europe’s added value in crisis management is, thanks to the variety of solutions it provides and the balance that it strikes in each of its operations between the civil and military dimensions. Moreover, in this regard, I reject the criticisms that some may direct at the Union’s security and defence policy, namely to suggest that it is all about militarisation. I sincerely believe in the complementary nature of the civil and military instruments that the Union possesses, and the recent crisis in Haiti, where you went – and I believe that you were able to observe this good cooperation – testifies to the need to link our civil and military resources so that we can cope with natural disasters and major crises. Precisely on the subject of these operations, we were anxious to review them all, to highlight what we feel are their strengths, but also, at times, their weaknesses – they have to be acknowledged so that things can improve. We were also anxious to highlight several regions of strategic importance for the security of the Union and to encourage the Council and the Commission to speed up the implementation of global strategies, in particular, for the Horn of Africa and for the Afghanistan­Pakistan region. In the area of capabilities – both civil and military – which is a crucial issue in terms of the credibility of our policy, the challenge is to improve the Union’s responsiveness. We have to be able to mobilise more quickly and more effectively the material resources and the competent personnel that the Member States have at their disposal. However, we also have to have the capability, by means of a security and defence industry that is efficient, that combines invaluable technological knowledge and that also accounts for hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe, to provide ourselves with equipment programmes corresponding to these forecasted needs. The Europe of industry and defence has begun to organise itself on our continent through the defence package. Issues relating to industrial and trade cooperation with third countries should be addressed quickly, particularly in the light of the recent problems encountered by European industries trying to access the US market, for example. This is a brief, inevitably overly brief, summary of the priorities that appear in this report and which represent all the challenges that you will have to take up. Parliament is ready to play its full role, its full positive and constructive role, to help you realise this ambition, which is a common ambition. Moreover, I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank all the political groups that have worked hard to enrich this report. We have all cooperated very well together to maintain a high level of ambition, while taking account, of course, of the characteristics of each of our groups. I would also take advantage of this opportunity, Baroness Ashton, to address with you today the issue of non­proliferation. On the eve of the Non­Proliferation Treaty review conference, to be held in May, the European Parliament wished to review with you the Union’s commitment in relation to the fight against proliferation, and to the control of arms and disarmament; this is the meaning behind the oral questions that have been put to you and which you will answer shortly. The international context seems to offer new opportunities on the eve of this review conference. Firstly, President Obama has strongly affirmed his ambition to have a world without nuclear weapons and his commitment to actively seek the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear­Test­Ban Treaty by the United States. Secondly, the conclusion with Russia of a new agreement designed to supersede the START Agreement seems to be going well and, lastly, we have the launch of the negotiations on a new disarmament treaty that would prohibit the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. With regard to the reduction in nuclear arsenals, the priority is obviously to reduce the two main arsenals, that is, those of Russia and the United States, which it is commonly believed still alone hold nearly 95% of all the nuclear weapons that exist on the planet. We therefore welcome the commitment made by Presidents Medvedev and Obama to conclude a new reduction agreement in the near future. How does the Union, in this context, envisage supporting these efforts and cooperating with the United States and Russia? The Union must also rise to the challenges posed to the non­proliferation regime and, more specifically, to those with which we are confronted by the two major proliferation crises that are Iran and North Korea, which remain the main threats to international security. Will the Union continue to commit itself effectively, completely, to resolving these crises, particularly in the case of Iran? We expect your guidance on this major issue, Baroness Ashton. Moreover, the Union has a role to play in promoting cooperation relating to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. You know that this is an important challenge. What actions are being carried out in this context, and what is your strategy on the matter? Lastly, the European Parliament wants the Union to be a proactive force during the forthcoming Non­Proliferation Treaty review conference. The adoption of a new ambitious and balanced common position by the Union is crucial if the latter is to defend its position. Where do the Member States stand in this regard? Arnaud Danjean,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all the speeches which, once again, have helped to enrich the debate, to enrich this report. I would like to reassure those who have voiced their doubts and, at times, their suspicions, about the fact that this report might open the door to more competition, with NATO in particular, and even to isolation. This is by no means the case; I absolutely do not believe that, and I would add that this does not appear in the treaty, quite the opposite. You can believe a French MEP who has fought tirelessly to have his country reinstated within the integrated structures of NATO. When we talk about strategic autonomy, what idea are we developing, what policy have we been developing, for 10 years? The answer is the ability of the European Union to intervene via civil and military missions in areas in which other organisations, including NATO, cannot. NATO could not have intervened to put a stop to the conflict in Georgia, where there is no UN or OSCE presence. NATO intervened no earlier than we did in the Horn of Africa to put a stop to events threatening our security interests. Strategic autonomy also means the ability to intervene with a range of instruments that we alone possess: civil and military instruments, legal instruments, financial instruments, development instruments. The European Union is best placed to develop this global approach in crisis areas. Our strategic autonomy also refers to our ability, where necessary, not to intervene, either in unilateral military campaigns, or – and this has been pointed out by several Austrian Members – because there are neutral countries among us and because we respect their status. This is what is meant by European defence and security. This is what is meant by the strategic autonomy that we are developing by means of this policy. Never forget the origins of this European Security and Defence Policy. It originates in a tragic, bloody failure: that of the Balkans in the 1990s, where the European Union was incapable of coping with a major security challenge on its own continent. Let us not forget that. Our European citizens have not forgotten it, and they would not forgive us if we abandoned the ambition to see Europe play a role on the international stage. (Applause) Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Mr President, Mrs Ashton, the events on Ashura Day and the bloody repression of the recent demonstrations in Iran have shown that it was a total mistake to make a very artificial distinction between the hardening of the regime internally and the inflexible policy that it pursues externally, in particular, on the Iranian nuclear issue. Consequently, the prospect of additional sanctions seems inevitable, or even desirable. I would like to know your point of view on the timetable and the nature of possible sanctions precisely so that we can make a clear link between the internal events in Iran and the nuclear issue. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
).

Madam President, Mrs Ashton, you were right to stress that the important thing in Yemen in terms of security priority is to end the internal conflicts that exist in that country. We must not confuse the causes and the consequences, and without playing down the terrorist risk, the main reason for the instability in Yemen is not terrorism. Terrorism develops because there is instability due to internal conflicts. From this point of view, the priority of the European Union should be to encourage and to support the efforts currently being made to start a national dialogue in Yemen with President Saleh. At regional level, there are – as we have just been reminded – links with the Somalian crisis and the crisis in the Horn of Africa. There are very sizeable migratory flows, but also arms trafficking and movement of jihadist fighters between Yemen and Somalia. In this respect, I would like to know where the European Union stands as regards the strengthening of maritime surveillance capacities, which also concern Yemen. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Madam President, much has been said about the action plan on Afghanistan. Speaking for myself, I regret that the presentations given to us today did not place slightly more emphasis on the link between the EUPOL mission and the NATO mission in Afghanistan. This is a mission that we must carry out. The quantitative and qualitative problems that it is encountering are mainly due to the link with NATO and, in order to be effective, we must solve them as quickly as possible. I would have liked more to have been said about this. My question concerns Pakistan, the chronic instability of which is, as we all know, a factor in the crisis for the entire region and for Afghanistan, too. I see, in the action plan, that cooperation with Pakistan is envisaged in the areas of counter-terrorism and security. In that country there is, as we know, a significant ideological and sometimes structural and organisational connection between radical Islamic movements that operate in Kashmir and at the Afghan border. I wanted to be sure that the methods, the nature and the timeframe of the assistance that we envisage are gauged properly, in order to prevent this connection from having extremely adverse and harmful effects. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, you rightly pointed out that the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon was going to enable us to enter a new era of enlargement policy, and we have to embark on this new process with realism and a clear head: that is the essence of this resolution. On the one hand, a new process does not mean going for broke. That would be the surest way of creating misunderstandings, even suspicion, among the public, and it would also be the best way of creating false ideas among the candidate countries and of encouraging them to take refuge in rhetorical and cosmetic policies rather than in policies aimed at more thorough reforms. We must be wary of steps, conditions and values on which we cannot compromise, and I believe in particular in cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal. On the other hand, it must be reaffirmed, in the clearest of terms, that the place of the western Balkans, of all the countries of the western Balkans, including Kosovo, is indeed in the European Union, and that we must encourage them to continue and to increase their efforts. There is no contradiction between making the demands clear, on the one hand, and showing full support for the process of enlargement to include the western Balkans, on the other, just as there is no contradiction between pursuing this philosophy of judging everyone on merit and having to take important initiatives for all of the countries in the region, such as visa liberalisation. Finally, allow me to say a word about Turkey. Before speculating on any very hypothetical future outcome concerning Turkey’s accession process, I will simply say that the Commission has noted, for the second year running, that no progress was made on the Ankara Protocol and that that prevented any new negotiating chapters from being opened. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, what I have to say has been said many times over by my fellow Members. At a time when Europe is considering a common strategy for its supply of raw materials and especially rare earths, we cannot overlook the huge potential that the intelligent recovery of our waste offers. Strengthening European standards so as to improve the functioning of the collection chain, solving problems relating to the leakage and illegal export of WEEE, and setting more ambitious collection targets: that is what should be at the heart of this legislation. Let us not forget who is chiefly responsible for the success or failure of this legislation: the consumer. Empowering the public is crucial if we want to implement effective legislation. To this end, Mr Florenz, the eco-contribution, among other systems, has proved to be a very important tool. Of course, electrical and electronic equipment producers must become more involved in the collection and recycling system, but we cannot absolve the citizens of all responsibility for the waste they produce. Our citizens must become actors and not spectators in European environmental policy. Catherine Soullie  (PPE
).

Madam President, Christians are, without doubt, one of the most persecuted religious groups in the world. In the Middle East, they are seen by some extremist groups as – I quote – ‘legitimate targets’, and the end goal is their departure, pure and simple, from this region, a region which saw the birth of Christianity, and a region in which their historical presence is essential for a certain kind of balance. The events in the Baghdad cathedral are merely the culmination of a situation that we have been observing passively for far too long. The European Union, as a global player and a business partner of various countries in this region, must strongly express its indignation with regard to this situation. Discrimination, of whatever kind, cannot be tolerated. Democracy will only be victorious in this region when the most fundamental human rights, such as religious freedom, are respected.

 In adopting this resolution, the European Parliament, the voice of European citizens and democracy, is sending a clear message to the Chinese authorities: that eradicating and subjugating one culture to benefit another is an act that is not worthy of any truly great and modern country. The Tibetan people have a wholly legitimate request: that their history and language should be respected. Tibetan culture is not the only one threatened by this unreasonable decision – Cantonese and other languages will also fall victim to the policy of standardisation. Given that the Chinese Constitution specifically recognises each citizen’s right to express him/herself in his/her chosen language, how can the political authorities justify this legal U-turn? The European Union’s motto clearly sums up the message that we have a duty to pass on to the Chinese authorities through this resolution: united in diversity. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, union and realism will be on show, at least I should like that to be the case, tomorrow when we vote on our resolution for this Sixteenth Conference of the Parties on Climate Change. I therefore hope that our Commissioner in charge will be able to keep the pragmatic targets that we must meet collectively, but also to defend the absolutely non-negotiable associated conditions that Europe has set. Neither must we lose sight in these negotiations of the expectations that our fellow citizens and our industries have of a fair balance. It is the world that must fight climate change, and not Europe on its own. Therefore it will be essential to recognise the importance of intellectual property that is inadequately protected. Green technologies must be of benefit to the greatest number, but that does not mean that we must sell our current and future knowledge on the cheap, even for the sake of this vital battle against climate change. Similarly, to ask for common methods of calculating emissions as well as verification and publication of data so that all emitting industries are put on the same scale seems to be a most legitimate request and not a negotiating tactic. Finally, and my fellow Member raised this just now, more controversial are the loopholes in the current Clean Development Mechanism that are also to be put on the table. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all, regretfully, well aware that the real negotiating power does not lie with the European Parliament. However, the willingness of a number of MEPs, myself included, to work and to participate in a positive outcome of this conference must be encouraged and not neglected, as we have felt it to be in the last few days. If Europe wishes to be strong at the heart of international dialogues, so must all its lawmakers be likewise. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 The vote on Mrs Estrela’s report is vitally important. The position adopted is purely demagogic and irresponsible. By demanding 20 weeks of maternity leave, we are discrediting the European Parliament. We are the citizens’ voice; to adopt such unrealistic positions would not do justice to them. Very significant costs for the social budgets of Member States would be incurred: as regards France, for instance, the amount would be EUR 1.3 billion. The current economic situation does not allow us to absorb this kind of increase within state budgets, not to mention the consequences for our companies who will have to bear part of these additional costs. We need to support and encourage women to better reconcile maternity and work, not scupper their chances of finding a job. The increase from 14 to 18 weeks proposed by the Commission was a real step forward; a step that could have been built on by giving some thought to new childcare options. The message conveyed by this text carries huge responsibility: maternity would clearly become a barrier to personal development in the workplace. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Madam President, the scale of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is clearly such that it demands us EU political representatives to ask ourselves questions about the safety of our own oil installations. In fact, one of the keys to protecting the marine environment is to ensure that oil exploration sites are as safe as possible. Nevertheless, the idea of a moratorium on current and future oil drilling in our waters is clearly premature and inappropriate. Premature, because the outcome of the investigation into the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is not yet known, and some preliminary conclusions confirm that it was due to a combination of behavioural, organisational and technical errors. Inappropriate because − as has been said several times − different regulations apply in the North Sea, in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico. Is it worth pointing out here the serious economic and social consequences that a moratorium would have, not to mention how it might jeopardise our energy independence? Last week, Norway and Russia ended a 40-year dispute and a 30-year moratorium by confirming the principle of a common maritime border in the Barents Sea and the Arctic. This agreement will, in practice, result in the two countries sharing a hydrocarbon-rich area. How, then, could the EU executive at the same time plan to ask for these oil activities to be suspended and for them to voluntarily place themselves in a position of weakness from an energy and economic point of view?

Mr President, as our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, reminded us, biocidal products play an essential role, be it in the domestic – and hence private – sphere or in relation to public places. Biocides safeguard our hygiene and health on a daily basis. It is important that we achieve a coherent Community text. It needs to be coherent, first and foremost, with other European legislation. REACH legislation, for example, cannot and must not come into conflict with the regulation on biocides. It is important to avoid administrative and legislative red tape which strangles and suffocates our businesses. On this point, I should like to express my support for the compromise achieved by our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, on the thorny issue of exclusion criteria and candidates for substitution. Similarly, the frame formulation approach for all biocidal products is an essential element of the regulation. It will significantly increase the efficacy of the Community authorisation system. Then, it is a Community text. The introduction of the concept of centralised authorisation in the Union, and the simplification of the procedure and the reduction in the authorisation times for certain tests relating to research and development activities, are two initial positive steps towards the harmonisation of the European market in biocidal products. Finally, we must not lose sight of our ambitions for this text: protection, of course, but the construction of our Community market and European innovation must also be an integral part of our approach.

 I deeply regret the fact that Parliament has adopted the motion for a resolution tabled by the Socialists, Liberals, Greens and Communists regarding the situation of the Roma people in Europe. I feel it is unacceptable to criticise France in that way, since it is not the only Member State to return Roma to their own country. The establishment of certain Roma camps is clearly prejudicial to public order and sometimes even a violation of the right to private property, and the burden it places on our social security system entitles the French Government to take such measures in accordance with the provisions of the European Treaties. The returns to Romania and Bulgaria were carried out in accordance with French and European law and in strict compliance with human rights. I welcome the decision by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to set up a working group on Roma integration in order to find a European solution to the issue of nomadism. We need to take a constructive approach to this subject. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

I approve of the result of the vote on the text referring to the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. It may not be perfect, but the Jeggle report seems to me at least to offer a good compromise; a compromise, moreover, that has won the support of the Eurogroup for Animals. The wording allows us effectively to limit tests causing pain to animals, while avoiding a diversion of research, and hence also of innovation, outside the Union, with the resulting loss of many jobs. As Vice-President of the Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals, I am moreover convinced that it is more valuable to keep animal experimentation on our territory, where it is strictly regulated, than to leave it to third countries, where sanitary conditions and respect for animal life often leave much to be desired.

I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on this very sound text, which has been adopted by a large majority in this House. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Affairs on business registers, I should like to stress the importance of this report. The data on commerce within the European Union are crucial to the positive development and the growth of our single market, and I look forward to the Commission’s legislative proposals on this issue. Mandatory participation of all Member States in a common business register would benefit the entire Union. However, this is possible only if care is taken not to impose additional administrative burdens on our businesses and if private data are kept private, in order to maintain a climate of confidence.

 Mr President, the final agreement which has been reached on the recast of the directives on industrial emissions is more than acceptable, and I welcome the work done to reach a compromise. This final package takes up the key points of the position which I defended with several of my colleagues within the Committee on the Environment, and which was designed to make this text an ambitious, yet realistic, piece of legislation. First, a degree of flexibility is maintained for businesses and for the authorities responsible for granting exemptions. Next, I must applaud the new version of the ESN, which caused so much controversy and which seems much more achievable now that it has been restricted to certain sectors. It is also important to point out that, thanks to the agreement reached, there is a stronger link with the Emission Trading System (ETS) Directive, and the somewhat irrelevant notion of creating an SO2
 and NOx quotas market has been removed once and for all from the text of the new directive. A few reservations should, nevertheless, be borne in mind, and they relate more specifically to the provisions on soils. The Soil Directive is still pending, and unfortunately, this major issue will be addressed only by those Member States which have their own legislation. Tomorrow, Parliament has a duty to adopt the points of the agreement reached at the end of the trialogues. Huge efforts have been made by all concerned to prevent this text from being sent back to the conciliation stage. It is a text which, may I remind you, is crucially important for industry and European environmental policy alike. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 I abstained from voting on the resolution on Israel’s boarding of the Mavi Marmara flotilla. I believe the resolution put forward unbalanced claims and an erroneous version of the facts. I think we need to await the results of the inquiry commission before trying to pass judgment on the Mavi Marmara incident. We must, of course, deplore the loss of human lives but, above all, we must analyse objectively and reasonably the decisions, actions and circumstances that led to this tragedy. Undoubtedly, Israel made political and military errors, but we should nevertheless remember that a naval blockade is a legitimate measure that is recognised by international law in the context of an armed conflict at sea. The blockade, which was put in place to stop arms trafficking in that region at war, was broken through and challenged by the same fleet which is now being presented to the world as the victim of an unjustified Israeli attack. Only a rational dialogue will enable negotiations between Israel and Gaza to move forward. In the framework of that dialogue, Europe is duty-bound to provide a calm, balanced view, without showing any undue partisan fervour. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

I am very pleased with the result of the vote on the Sommer report. The European Parliament has opted for a legible and informative labelling system that will favour balanced consumption patterns. Furthermore, I welcome the adoption of Amendment 205, which will allow for the inclusion of mandatory particulars for meat and meat products derived from animals that have not been stunned prior to slaughter. The consumer needs to be informed of respect for animal welfare practices, practices that are at the heart of European food policy. This is not about stigmatising religious communities or putting their meat production and distribution chain in difficulty, but simply about letting European citizens consume with full knowledge of the facts.

This report on progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals has developed into something that I was unable to support: I considered it was important to vote against the Cashman report as a whole, following the adoption of the second point of paragraph 42 of Mr Cashman’s draft report, which was put to the vote. The lack of clarity regarding the idea behind the expression ‘safe abortion’ was impossible to ignore. Abortion, although necessary in some exceptional circumstances, must not be regarded as a method of contraception. What is more, like all medical procedures, it is never without risk. We must not trivialise it. Development depends first and foremost on respect for life. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Reducing the Israeli­Palestinian conflict to a mere comparison of the number of deaths in one or the other warring camp can only distort our view of this war, which has been going on for too long now. We all agree that it is difficult to find a solution to this conflict, since the causes themselves are complex and deep­rooted. Thus, seeing things in purely black and white terms is impossible in this area of the world. The mission led by Judge Goldstone was tasked solely with listing the violations of international law. Although not all of the conclusions in this report are unjustifiable, voting against these resolutions, which approved the approach and the conclusions of a text that I believe has been managed in a biased fashion but, above all, on the basis of incomplete objectives, struck me as being the most honest intellectual solution. Yes, we do need to denounce and stop the abuses that are committed by one or the other of the warring parties in that region, but we need to be very careful with regard to the procedure used if we want the justice to be established in the region to lead us in the direction of a lasting peace.

Mr President, today there remains less than 15% of the original bluefin tuna stock. In the face of such figures, the solution seems obvious. Nevertheless, we should not forget about the jobs affected by the decision that we are discussing today. It should be pointed out that the aim of the CITES is not to prohibit fishing but merely the international trade in this type of fish, 80% of which is exported to Japan. By protecting tuna, we are certainly protecting an endangered species, but we are also encouraging the continuation of a more balanced and sustainable fishing activity, one that is destined for our internal market and which generates employment. I am in favour of the idea of listing bluefin tuna in Appendix I of the CITES and, while I believe that this decision will be positive, the help of the Commission will be crucial, since it will mean that the fisheries sector can be completely overhauled. My question therefore concerns the conditions of this support. France is requesting an 18-month extension accompanied by financial measures for those fishermen and ship-owners affected by a trade ban. What is the Commission’s view on the subject? Moreover, I, like many of my colleagues, am concerned about fairness. How can we guarantee that boats flying the flag of countries such as Tunisia, Libya and so on will apply the international trade ban as rigorously as we do? What will the new control and penalty measures consist of? Our policy of having sustainable economic activities has to be practical, and sometimes even unpopular in certain sectors, but I hope that the Commission and the Council do not lose sight of the adjustments needed in order to implement these measures.

 Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we no longer need to demonstrate the importance of the issue of climate change. Its short, medium and long-term impacts are undeniable, although the results from the JESC have made the front page of a certain national newspaper and will undoubtedly strengthen the sceptics’ position. The Copenhagen conference appeared to the world to be a unique opportunity for world leaders to bear witness to, act on and correct the effects of this process of climate change. The European Union was a key player at this forum, not only on account of the bold legislation we have passed to limit the impact of our activities on climate, but also because Europe represents a union of countries which can really make a difference. The outcome of the Copenhagen conference has obviously left a feeling of dissatisfaction, but I refuse to call it a failure. The world, including even one of the most reluctant countries, China, has agreed on the issue of limiting the increase in temperature to two degrees. Brazil has just passed a law aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by around 39% by 2020, in line with its undertakings. Many other countries also showed great ambition with regard to greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. I am thinking here of Japan and Norway. I must also highlight the very positive point that was the consensus achieved on the urgent need for a mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation. A specific and unanimous text was produced on the implementation of the so-called REDD+ mechanism to reduce deforestation and enable CO2
 to be stored naturally. Although far from a binding agreement, but clearly along the lines of a political agreement, the outcome of Copenhagen should lead us to question why it was such a disappointment. I attended the Copenhagen conference, as did a number of my fellow Members, with this desire to participate, to help and to see a Europe of negotiation and of leadership take action. I was hugely disappointed because Europe, and particularly Parliament, clearly did not play the role that it deserved to in the negotiations. To make its presence felt, Europe must be seen to be stronger in this area. The meeting of our environment ministers in Seville went nowhere, and our leaders were seen to be unsure and hesitant, and we are still divided over our targets. I hope that Mrs Hedegaard, armed with her proposals and the undertakings she gave before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will be able to restore the ambitions of the European Union.

Freedom of the press is an absolute requirement. A democratic legislative institution like the European Parliament obviously cannot question this benefit. The protection and defence of freedom of information must be guaranteed in all circumstances. Nevertheless, the European Parliament does not have a duty to be a supranational court of justice. Pluralism and freedom of all media must be ensured in the European Union, but it does not behove us as MEPs to judge a country and its leaders on the nature of the relations between the press and the political world. Interference by the European Parliament in this area is unacceptable. What is our legitimacy for issuing any opinion whatsoever on the condition of the Italian media? This is an internal political debate of a Member State, a debate that must be held and resolved inside the frontiers of the State concerned. The rejection of the amendment which intended to change the name of this resolution to give it a more Community-orientated feel demonstrates the targeted and purely political nature of this debate. We must be careful we do not transform our assembly into a court. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Following the vote on the joint resolution on freedom of information in Italy and in the European Union as a whole, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is very satisfied. What we needed to do was to set out clearly the role of the European Parliament: we are a legislative assembly and not a tribunal on the internal affairs of the Member States. It would not have been appropriate for this disguised personal attack to have been supported by Parliament. I am very pleased with the outcome of the vote.

Providing aid to developing countries is one duty that the European Union must not abandon. The current economic and financial crisis has given a new dimension to globalisation. The idea of a tax on financial transactions was beneficial: President Sarkozy has made it one of his priorities. Europe, it seems, has set the pace and the world has followed. The new, sound workings of international finance will have to be based on fairness. Thus, I regret that the Striffler-Ponga amendment has been rejected, as it proposed a tax on financial transactions to be added to official development assistance, so that the least developed countries could benefit from it. It is true that our economies and our financial systems would have had a greater tax burden, but the European Union would thus have been the initiator of a great international solidarity movement. We can still hope that the resolution adopted here will encourage the Union to honour its commitments and to help developing countries keep pace with globalisation. Christophe Béchu  (PPE

Mr President, I would just like to say that it may be the case that we have not organised our agenda very well today. If having free trade agreements means that we allow products to enter Europe that respect neither our social standards nor our environmental standards, the reform of the common agricultural policy will be pointless. Clearly we cannot continue to take this hypocritical approach where, on the one hand, we impose environmental restrictions relating to health and safety traceability on our farmers, on the grounds that we have to protect consumers, and, on the other hand, we allow products that fail to meet these standards to enter our continent freely. That is precisely the issue being discussed behind the scenes at the negotiations with Mercosur. Although we are being told that Parliament was very well informed and that matters have been as transparent and as clear as possible, the way in which things have been initiated does not give us a good impression of a negotiation that is being held at the same time as other negotiations are taking place at the WTO. For the sake of consistency, and of protecting consumers and our farmers, I feel that we cannot continue down this track. Christophe Béchu  (PPE

Mr President, there has to be consistency in politics. Over the last few weeks, many of us in this House have demanded measures from the Commission. When solutions are proposed to us, we will vote in favour of those solutions, even if – I agree with what has been said – they are slow in coming and even if they have had to be extracted by means of the positions adopted both within the European Parliament and among ministers. This amount, which will be useful in the very short term, does not resolve, as many have already said, the long-term issues concerning the way in which the planned end of quotas is dealt with. If we want to be in a position to cope with and to prevent repeated crises within the agricultural produce sector, there is no way that we can do so without production regulation and control tools or without a combination of the two. That is not the issue at stake this evening, however. The issue at stake this evening, the only issue that counts at the moment, is that of Article 186. Commissioner, I have one simple question: in concrete terms, what is Article 186 meant to do, and from when and in what way? Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

 Madam President, as we are talking of economic returns in relation to pay equality, I have a question for you: the Member States invest as much in the training of girls as they do in that of boys; it seems to me that, if we followed your argument to its logical conclusion, that has to be a rather poor investment, has it not? That is not a view I share. On the contrary, I believe that we must encourage women’s work and value it. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Ms Bauer for her work, which I fully support. However, secondly, and this request is for you, Commissioner, could you tell Ms Reding that our patience is running out? Today we are in a position where the Charter of Fundamental Rights is being blatantly violated by pay inequalities which trouble no one. I was upset by hearing you say that things had got better because the gap had been reduced from 17.5% to 16.4%. I was upset because I truly believe that Europe has a crucial role to play in showing the Member States the way forward. We must of course respect the equality of citizens before the law; that is a fundamental right and we must ensure it is respected. However, over and above this, what we want is transparency, transparency so that everyone is aware of the real pay gap that exists in our society. The public sector should set an example. SMEs too clearly have a role to play, as does the private sector, but the public sector must also set an example. That is why, when Ms Bauer calls for encouragement and also for sanctions, I think we should support any future legal appeals that women bring against pay disparities. The Member States clearly need to be coerced, private business clearly needs to be coerced, but we also need to coerce the public sector, and we must adopt every possible measure, as Mr Gustafsson said just now, to ensure that women benefit from the pay equality that is achieved. We have had enough. We want growth and, for there to be growth, we need women. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

In addition to the ‘sensitive areas’ investment programme for the Mediterranean, supported by the European neighbourhood and partnership instrument, other EU programmes deserve a mention: strengthening the capacities of environmental authorities, systems for sharing information on the environment, sustainable water management, cooperation on urban development and dialogue and various other research projects.

 This Parliamentary report presents a balanced and calm approach to a highly controversial subject, and I am pleased about this. I am of the opinion that the choice of energy mix and shale gas extraction permits are of national competence. This conforms to the principle of technological neutrality I defend under the Energy Roadmap 2050. This is why I do not agree with the idea of a European moratorium on shale gas exploration and extraction. Nevertheless, the European Union should draw up, on a European scale, rules that guarantee protection of the environment and high safety levels. At present, hydraulic fracturing poses serious problems that cannot be ignored. Moreover, while there is talk of abundant shale hydrocarbon resources in Europe, no one can say with certainty that the potential is sufficiently promising to envisage industrial exploitation. Therefore, to make enlightened choices, let us continue evaluating the presumed reserves and researching exploration techniques. Let us not close the door on this energy source, in view of the developments on the world energy market and the stakes with regard to competitiveness for Europe. Gaston Franco  (PPE

I voted in favour of the 2013 budget because it maintains the European programme for the most deprived persons. I would stress, however, that this programme must be maintained in the next financial framework for 2014-2020; the challenge is to focus on the long term because the associations need to be visible in order to carry out their missions in full. A year ago, many associations expressed their concern that the funding for the programme had been called into question by the Court of Justice of the European Union, putting the food supply of 18 million people in jeopardy. That situation was unacceptable and it does not reflect the idea of a protective Europe that I defend. Thanks to the mobilisation of many governments, including François Fillon’s Government at that time, an agreement was reached in the Council of the European Union to maintain the programme’s funding for two more years, namely 2012 and 2013. The beneficiaries of the programme can be reassured that the financial envelope of EUR 500 million will certainly be maintained in 2013 and I welcome that.

Presented by France in 2010, this application relates to 2 089 workers who were made redundant in the group’s subsidiaries in Ille-et-Vilaine, Franche-Comté, Alsace, Lorraine and Île-de-France.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Mr Kariņš, for this difficult report, given the sensitive nature of bilateral negotiations in the field of energy between the Member States and third countries. The agreement reached in trialogue will allow the rapid implementation of the Commission’s draft decision and, wishing to be pragmatic, we cannot but welcome it. Europe of energy is making progress, admittedly slow progress, but nevertheless progress. The European Union relies heavily on imported energy, and is in a position of structural dependence on certain supplier countries. In order for our thinking on our energy strategy to become more European, it therefore became necessary to make information on energy agreements more widely available in the Commission, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity. The establishment of an information exchange mechanism with regard to intergovernmental agreements will therefore ensure greater transparency of the energy market and, thus, allow us to anticipate problems of energy supply. I welcome the fact that this decision does not create obligations as regards agreements between commercial entities. At times of crisis and, given the issues involved in terms of competition and competitiveness, we have a duty to protect our companies’ interests and the safeguards for private contracts. Gaston Franco  (PPE
),

This text is realistic and ambitious. The proposed regulatory framework is an important step towards achieving the goals set within the energy and climate package, as well as promoting green growth and employment. With the addition of the European sectoral measures on energy efficiency and the provisions taken at national level by Member States, the European Union should therefore be in a position to meet its indicative target for energy efficiency, set at 20% by 2020. It is essential to fight against waste, control energy use and drive innovation, without reducing our production and economic activity. At a time when the issue of energy costs is on everyone’s mind, let us not forget that the best energy is that which we do not consume. Finally, I am particularly pleased with the provisions of the directive which aim to promote heating and cooling efficiency. However, I do regret that the final compromise does not incorporate my amendment aimed at creating a category of cogeneration units between 1 and 20 MW in remote areas that are disadvantaged and have insufficient electricity, in particular where resources are available nearby. This could have helped stimulate decentralised energy production in rural areas. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Member for the quality of his report, which I will support with pleasure. Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, our economy and our industry in Europe depend on resources and raw materials, the prices of which are become increasingly unstable and access to which is becoming uncertain in a context of fierce international competition. These include, for example, rare earths, which are necessary for many new technologies, and of which China holds almost all the mining potential. In order to protect not only our industrial competitiveness but also our environment, it is imperative that we learn how to be less dependent on these resources by developing innovation and recycling. The European Union must move towards a real circular economy, in which extending the life cycle of materials would be a priority, from the product design stage right through to the re-use and recycling of waste. With a view to efficiency, recovering energy from waste must also be promoted. We must also turn to the sustainable exploitation of resources, the potential of which is still too often underestimated. I should like to emphasise the importance of the natural capital represented by forest resources. Timber is a renewable energy source and an ideal, healthy and natural building material. Faced with the dynamism of emerging powers, we must adopt a more proactive and more imaginative attitude in the use of resources so that we can return to growth. The European Union must encourage its enterprises to create more innovative and more sustainable products. It must also exert an influence on the behaviour of consumers by empowering them. I therefore support the experiments in progress on the environmental impact labelling of products, the aim of which is to give Europeans credible information on the environmental impact of their consumption choices. Let us not forget that resources like water, for example, are fragile and precious goods. Gaston Franco,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Leinen, thank you for the work that we have carried out together. The European Union needs a manifesto, a common political vision with regard to the major environmental challenges for 2020 and beyond. That is why it is so useful to launch a 7th Environment Action Programme harmonising the existing financial frameworks and mobilising new funding resources. This programme should ensure that the EU’s environmental strategies are consistent with, and integrated into, sectoral policies, whether these relate to agriculture, fishing, research and innovation, health, transport, regional development or land management and, of course, urban policies. In spite of the economic crisis that has been giving the European Union a hard time, we must not give in to a short-term vision and abandon all ambition in terms of the environment and climate. To do nothing would be fatal. The issues are too important, particularly with regard to efficient resource use and valuing natural capital. We must therefore invest resolutely in the sustainable economy and eco-innovation, which are sources of growth, competitiveness and jobs. It is up to us to promote eco-design and recycling, but also environmental labelling of products in order to avoid waste and poor consumption choices. We cannot overlook this environmental lesson that European citizens need. The Environment Action Programme is a political programming instrument, but it is also a communication tool. It must provide the readability and predictability that is necessary not only for national and local authorities and citizens, but also for entrepreneurs and investors with regard to the European Union’s environmental choices. European regulation must not become a punishment or a vice. Gaston Franco  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that this amending budget concerning the financing of ITER was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Budgets on 29 March. By financing this cost overrun, we avoid scrapping a fundamental strategic research project in which the European Union has a leading role, and we honour our international commitments. Let us remember that none of the seven partners of the EURATOM community has questioned its overall contribution to the project. Japan, despite the drama of Fukushima, decided to honour its budgetary commitments in ITER to the full. Without this agreement, hundreds of researchers would have had to suspend their work and the ITER project would have suffered detrimental delays. Today, 1 000 people work for ITER in Cadarache. In the period from 2015 to 2017-2018, the building construction and machine assembly phase saw between 4 000 and 5 000 people deployed on this site. In conclusion, Mr President, ITER is a project Europe can take pride in and a symbol of our excellence. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 I welcome the motion for a resolution adopted by the European Parliament ahead of the forthcoming climate change conference in Durban. It is vital that we reach an international, legally binding agreement. We call on the European Union to confirm its strong commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and to show its unequivocal support for a second commitment period post-2012. The EU must formally invite all of its international partners to do the same, in order to achieve the objectives set by the Kyoto Protocol, namely reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting global warming linked to climate change to 2°C. This resolution has allowed us to turn the spotlight on a subject that is very close to my heart: improving forest management as a prerequisite for reducing deforestation. In particular, we have emphasised the need to implement the mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). Parliament has thus sent a strong message aimed at the establishment of a proper mechanism for combating deforestation, which accounts for some 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Given the extent of the European and international disasters that we have faced, such as the tsunami in 2004, Haiti in 2010 and Fukushima in 2011, it is high time that Europe had an effective system to ensure a rapid response to disasters. That is why I welcome the adoption of this report, which is the first step towards a harmonised, organised and united response from the European Union. I tabled a number of amendments, which were adopted in the final report, to emphasise the importance of prevention in crisis management and the organisation of this prevention through operational tools, which I welcome. Until more thought has been given to the establishment of any real future European civil protection force, I think that the creation of a European emergency response centre will simplify the current European Civil Protection Mechanism. I called for this European centre to be equipped with two Community tools to protect forests from forest fires, EFFIS and EFFICS, which was adopted in the final report. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 As the rapporteur for the opinion of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I would like to congratulate Carlo Fidanza on his excellent report, which is a foundation stone for a true European strategy to stimulate and complement the Member States’ action in the tourism field. Tourism is a key industry, and a source of growth and job creation. Europe needs tourism that is in phase with the modern world, the changes in world demand and the changes in our societies. We need tourism that is innovative and competitive but that also respects the environment, local cultures and local conditions. In a context of international competition between destinations, we have everything to gain from promoting our assets, our trades and our know-how, and from better communicating our unique European and national features. Therefore, the recent creation of a festival of French gastronomy celebrated on the first day of autumn is an excellent initiative that we should welcome. Sustainable tourism, cultural tourism, business and conference tourism, health tourism: these are the priorities. We should also establish Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in the tourism field in the wake of the Arab Spring. We need to make every effort together to bring prosperity to the Mediterranean on the basis of common standards and projects. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 I welcome the adoption of this own-initiative report aimed at improving the safety of offshore oil and gas platforms. Following the Gulf of Mexico disaster, I voiced my support for an improvement in safety in order to prevent a repeat of this kind of disaster, which not only endangers marine ecosystems but also severely affects the economic sectors of fishing and tourism. Parliament has voted in favour of stricter controls by independent experts and of the adoption of contingency plans prior to each operation, which I believe is an effective and proportionate response to the need to improve the safety of these platforms. Parliament has also referred to the industry’s liability in the event of a disaster, in accordance with the polluter pays principle, but without overlooking the supervisory and coordinating role that the public sector must play. I am pleased that my political group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), has insisted that no moratorium be imposed on the subject. Indeed, the introduction of a moratorium on all new deep-sea oil drilling in EU waters would be a disproportionate reaction to the need to ensure high safety standards across the EU.

 I welcome the adoption of this report, which is undoubtedly a step towards an EU energy policy promoting the successful interconnection of energy networks between Member States across national and regional borders. In order to address major challenges in the development and security of energy infrastructure in Europe, the European Parliament wished to adopt an own-initiative report in anticipation of the legislative proposal concerning a new European instrument in this field. Interconnection capacity or its availability between Member States still remains insufficient in one-third of the Union. Modernisation, cross-border interconnection and timely adaptation of energy infrastructure are essential to achieving the energy objectives for 2020, especially those concerning the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix of Member States. Market-based tools and the user-pay principle should remain the basis for financing energy infrastructure. However, the rapporteur realistically identified criteria defining projects ‘of European interest’ likely to obtain public finance, which has to result in an innovative mix of financial instruments that levers private investment. Gaston Franco  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about improving the safety of nuclear power, not about calling civil nuclear power into question when it is an essential component of energy independence and of the fight against greenhouse gases in many Member States of the European Union. The European initiative of performing stress tests on all our power stations is a first essential and reasonable step which responds to the expectations of European citizens. We must carry out these tests using a common approach and common criteria whose methodology will have to be entrusted to the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group. The neighbouring countries of the European Union should also undergo these tests, given the cross-border risks that exist. Besides these tests, the European Union must work to harmonise international standards at the highest level, within the G20 and the International Atomic Energy Agency, on the basis of the Western European Nuclear Regulators’ Association’s objectives for new reactors. Within the European Union, we should promote and intensify cooperation between the national safety authorities. The European Union must serve as a model, both for the strengthening of the rules and for efforts in solidarity. In the face of this type of disaster, I think that the creation of a European Civil Protection Force is needed more than ever. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 I am delighted that, after five years of negotiations, Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) have been concluded with Cameroon and with the Republic of the Congo. These agreements will help ensure good forest governance by granting FLEGT licences to timber products from these countries and thus guaranteeing the sustainable exploitation and management of their forests. It is essential to have a system by which to monitor movements of timber and derived products from harvesting right up to export. Twenty to thirty per cent of world industrial timber production is illegal, as is 60% of the harvesting that has taken place in Africa over the last 10 years. These VPAs will therefore help preserve the forests in these countries by combating illegal harvesting, which causes significant environmental, economic and social damage. The main advantage of these VPAs is that they will apply to all exports between the EU and these countries, together with all other timber importing countries. I hope that this VPA system will be rolled out quickly to other forest countries. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is quite rightly asking itself whether an oil disaster such as the one that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico could happen in our waters. Since oil spills have destroyed our coasts and left a lasting impression on us numerous times in the past, we quite rightly believe that the preservation and protection of marine ecosystems, animal biodiversity and the economic sectors of fishing and tourism are of paramount importance. However, we must keep a cool head and resist adopting an extreme position which the introduction of a moratorium on any further deep-water oil drilling in Europe would represent. Firstly, because we have very strict safety standards for exploitation and exploration in Europe. Furthermore, national regulators and oil companies in Europe have themselves pledged to amend the exploitation and safety rules and procedures if the outcome of the US investigation into the disaster so demands. Secondly, in view of our requirement for energy independence, it would be highly risky, from a geostrategic point of view, to abandon our North Sea drilling operations. Ultimately, it is the future of our oil industry that we are jeopardising if we shut down its exploration and extraction activities. How could we justify the consequent impact on employment growth in a time of crisis? Gaston Franco  (PPE
),

 Nowadays, 20-30% of industrial timber production worldwide is from illegal sources. We need to clean up the European timber market as soon as possible. While it could still be improved, the proposed regulation is ambitious and courageous. In my view, it is an effective tool for limiting rampant deforestation, without imposing administrative constraints on our European companies or harming timber, which will, on the contrary, become more highly valued. The regulation establishes a binding provision which delegates responsibilities on the basis of the ‘due diligence system’. This allows operators to trace timber and timber products, to access information on observance of the applicable legislation and, thus, to obtain sufficient guarantees to prevent the sale of products from logging considered to be illegal. The obligations contained in the regulation must target those operators who place timber on the market for the first time, because that is when there is the most risk. Furthermore, in order to guarantee that this regulation is effective, we should emphasise the need for regular controls and a system of stringent, deterrent penalties for offenders.

I am surprised by the absence of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy from the scene of the natural disaster in Haiti. In spite of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union still has difficulty in showing its face on the international stage, and that is most regrettable. It seems to me that the European crisis response system is too fragmented, too complex and not successful enough. In terms of the rehabilitation of Haiti (for which EUR 100 million are earmarked) and the reconstruction of the country (EUR 200 million), what exactly will the EDF and the Stability Instrument fund? Furthermore, to respond to the UN request in terms of logistical and security support, the European Union must, in my view, be in a position to use all the instruments provided by the Treaty of Lisbon, including military response. I call for the rapid establishment of a European civil protection force as devised by Mr Barnier in 2006 with the aim of arriving at a European response that is planned, genuinely coordinated and effective. The recent statements by Mr Van Rompuy are along the right lines. He advocated the creation of a humanitarian rapid reaction force. What will be the exact nature of this project and when will it see the light of day? Gaston Franco  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this summer, once again, the Mediterranean forest was engulfed in flames: in Marseille and in southern Corsica, but also in Italy, in Spain and, on a larger scale, in Greece. More than 400 000 hectares of forest and field went up in smoke, causing considerable material damage, irreparable damage to biodiversity, and the tragic loss of human lives. Dismayed as I am by this assessment made repeatedly, year after year, and mindful as I am of the multiplier effect of global warming on fires, I call for European awareness of the need for more coordinated efforts and for the pooling of fire-fighting resources. I should like to see a huge Euro-Mediterranean cooperation project to combat forest fires take shape under the Union for the Mediterranean. I welcome the existing initiatives and, in particular, the European Forest Fire Information System – the pilot project. Nevertheless, I call for a reform of the European Union Solidarity Fund so that it will become an effective tool for responding to crises. I also call for the strengthening of the European protection force and of the ‘EuropeAid’ facility devised by Mr Barnier in 2006 for intervention on the territory of the 27 Member States, as well as abroad. I believe that one of the keys to the problem of forest fires has to do with information sharing and best practice as regards prevention, and I should like to point out the pioneering role played by the forest fire fighters in my own department. I can, of course, provide Europe with this example, which may be of use. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur
. − Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report today is an assessment of what is now a significant part of European economic governance. I would like to thank the group rapporteurs, with whom I was able − and this is not just words − to undertake genuine constructive work. I believe that this report, taken overall, reflects the concerns of everyone, even if not all have been taken up in a strict sense.  This report was also undertaken in close cooperation with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in accordance with Rule 50, which explains why the report takes up a number of provisions in their entirety, without a vote, so as to properly respect those rules and the ideas of that committee; the rules prevailed. I am not going to list the various points we are emphasising in terms of the Semester content; I would rather talk about what concerned us the most, namely the method. The Semester is, as I was saying, a very important element in establishing coordination of States’ economic and financial policies and involves both European and national levels. That is already something new. In fact, while the Commission’s proposals must next be validated by the Council before being reflected, as far as possible, in national budgets, there is a need, in terms of democratic control, for sound understanding and proper coordination with national parliaments. In this regard, we know − and I do not think anyone will mind me saying − that some of our national parliaments do not fully understand Community Mechanisms and there is a certain apprehension when they see the European level take precedence over national level. That is why some, quite legitimately, assert that national sovereignty entitles them to adopt the budget they want and that they do not have to obey instructions or orders from elsewhere. There is, therefore, undoubtedly work to be done to educate and explain. Indeed, a meeting was recently held in Brussels with the representatives of the financial or economic committees of the national parliaments to explain this European Semester. I had the opportunity, as rapporteur, to say that MEPs have no intention whatsoever of interfering in national relations or the working of national parliaments and that, in reality, the European Parliament and national parliaments have a specific task, that of providing democratic control at their level. I think that in future such meetings will have to be repeated to encourage understanding of the system and its proper application. In this regard, it would certainly be a good thing for these meetings, currently organised in a fairly ad hoc way, to be more formal and, in particular, for those attending the meetings to be able to do so regularly, so that genuine dialogue may be established between national parliaments and the European Parliament. On issues of method, we also stress the need, for instance, for recommendations to be more explicit so that outcomes may be evaluated and, if necessary, corrected. Lastly, I will add that it is also important for States to meet the commitments they have themselves made. It seems an obvious thing to say but, unfortunately, the opposite is often seen. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur
. − Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for passing on our observations to Mr Rehn, but he had taken the trouble of telephoning me yesterday to explain that he would be detained elsewhere today and I was grateful to him for doing so. Sometimes our debates are accused of being simply a string of words with no discernible direct impact on the work presented by the rapporteur. I would like, today, to try to prove the opposite and to respond to those Members − I thank all those who have spoken − who made a request. As regards Ms Trautmann’s request, I will give very serious consideration to withdrawing Amendments 4 and 5. Of course, I have to talk to my Group, since I am a loyal ordinary foot soldier; but I will do all I can to please you and to follow the recommendation made to me, by telephone, by my friend Mr Lamassoure. As regards the reference to the Fiscal Stability Treaty, there is a paragraph where we had fun but, strictly speaking, this reference is not of any consequence. In addition, we could be accused of talking about intergovernmentalism in a Union text; I will therefore also ask the Group for authority to remove paragraph 23 entirely. I hope that, in this way, the excellent cooperative work undertaken during preparation of this report may continue until the vote and thus show Parliament’s determination to make the European Semester a highly effective exercise. In this regard, I would like to say to Ms Zuber –
 I am a little sorry, Commissioner Barnier also just answered her –
 but it seems to me that we are not living in a time bubble and, without European solidarity, I dare not think what would be happening in some countries today. I think that has to be taken into account. Europe is not in the process of oppressing countries in difficulty. I think, on the contrary, that it is endeavouring to help them. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

Mr President, Commissioner, to start with, I would of course like to congratulate you and thank you for the extremely thorough and very expeditious work that you have carried out to introduce the two proposals that are here before us today. We shall play a different role in each of them, which will also be dependent on the legal basis. However, Commissioner, I feel, when I listen to what each of you has to say and read the newspapers, that these negotiations are fraught with danger, because people’s opinions are different. The commitments entered into are not clear. Yet, we are currently being watched closely by our fellow citizens, who want to understand and see what Europe is doing, by our entrepreneurs, who want to know if they can invest, and by the markets, which are anxious to know what to do. I believe that, in the coming months and weeks, the direction that the negotiations take will be a determining factor. I shall not go into technical details here, as they will be the subject of the debate, but I shall merely observe that, unless we show a real European spirit, unless we show that we can set aside short-term national interests and unless we are able to put in place genuinely robust European institutions, all our work will be to no avail and cause disappointment. I am confident in your determination, Commissioner, which I know to be unflagging. You have a record that does credit to you and, therefore, we can say that luck is on our side. It is now up to the Member States to shoulder their responsibilities and rise above squabbles over technical matters. The issue is not how we share out one minor competence or another. The real issue is whether we are able to create banking union, or at least a quality prudential control system, to put finance at the service of the economy. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). -  
(FR) 
Mr President, I am talking about the rule on blue-card questions. You have just made the observation that I wished to make. I wanted to know whether, on the subject of banking Union, we were not perhaps spectators at an island ping-pong competition. I believe that the system which consists of hijacking the use of blue-card questions by asking questions to friends of one's own group, thereby increasing one's speaking time, is essentially a poor use of the procedure. I am astonished that this should come from a country where fair play is generally held in high esteem. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Madam President, I would like to thank my colleagues for their support and I propose that the report be referred back to committee so that we can start the trialogue discussions and try to reach an agreement at first reading. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Minister, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to recap on why this report has come back to the plenary sitting today, after having been adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). The regulation on countries experiencing difficulties, for which I was rapporteur, was adopted by 25 votes to 4, with 13 abstentions. The abstentions were primarily by the Socialists. However, they did vote in favour of most of the amendments and all of the compromise amendments. Before opening the negotiations, which, from what we have been hearing from the Presidency, will not be easy, I felt it was important to obtain a more solid mandate from plenary. When the time comes, therefore, I will ask that we do not proceed with the vote on the legislative resolution so that, if applicable, we can secure an agreement at first reading. This draft regulation on strengthening economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability in the euro area is set against the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis that the European Union is facing and will continue to face. The Union is trying to learn lessons from the crisis, and to propose solutions. The Commission’s proposals complement the package on economic governance: the ‘six-pack’ adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2011. Excessive national debt can have dramatic consequences, both within the countries concerned and for the other Member States of the European Union. The difficulties of a small country can even have global repercussions. What is at risk is the euro area’s reputation, rather than its existence. The serious economic and social consequences that some Member States are experiencing today could have been avoided if early, targeted action had been taken. At the time, the European Union did not have the necessary instruments, but this will now be put right by the combination of the ‘six-pack’ and two new pieces of legislation (the ‘two-pack’), including this one. The ‘six-pack’ needs to be strengthened, in order to ensure both financial stability and economic growth in the euro area. Several Member States have had to seek financial assistance. Preventive action at an early stage is preferable to corrective measures taken later – perhaps too late – in the proceedings. The broad thrust of the draft regulation adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is in line with the original proposal, which provides for a Member State whose currency is the euro to be subject to enhanced surveillance when it is experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, severe financial disturbance. It should be swiftly returned to a normal situation and the other euro area Member States should be protected against possible negative spillover effects. The regulation sets out clear procedures to this effect for countries experiencing difficulties. The parliamentary committee was keen to increase the powers that the original proposal gave the Commission, in particular, by introducing wider use of the reverse qualified majority rule in Council votes. For example, this rule would apply when the Commission recommends that a country should take corrective measures, or when it instructs a country to submit new debt reduction plans. Such decisions would be deemed to have been adopted unless the Council categorically rejected them. It is worth mentioning that ECON adopted the protection system for States in major difficulties by a wide majority. I would like to point out that there were no negotiations on this amendment and that the vote was left to each individual’s judgment. A majority of our Members chose not to heed the arguments put forward by detractors of this proposal, which were partly based on a distorted presentation of its objective. The intention is not to organise a restructuring or reduction of the debt, but to allow the State to get itself back into shape so that it can deal with its obligations. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, in view of the time, we have to avoid making very long speeches. I would just like to mention to the Commissioner that I share his concern that we should move swiftly and thereby show how effective the community method is. I would like to tell the President-in-Office of the Council, who really could not care less, that it is our firm intention to gain a large majority vote here and to start the trialogue. Before the debate began this morning, there was the matter of Schengen and the Danish Presidency. I hope that on this subject, you will show that you are able to take Parliament’s opinions into account. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, this tax has caused quite a stir, and we have seen how some of our colleagues have engaged in mudslinging before immediately leaving the debate. I would like to simply reiterate the fact that Parliament has already made its position regarding this tax very clear through several resolutions and decisions. I think that the important thing today is effective implementation, because we are sustaining the report with a whole series of plans, a whole series of words and, behind it, nothing much is happening. In my opinion, it is important for us to be realistic. Since this is a tax matter, Parliament is only being consulted on this report and, in view of this, I feel we must be clear and concise when stating our views. The Commission’s proposal is interesting and good, and I believe we should support it. We must not try to weaken it; there are already strong disagreements within the Council and the chances of seeing the success of this report as we wish, at EU level, are relatively slim. That is why some people suggest that we work in closer cooperation. That is one of the ideas. Parliament is only consulted on this subject, but we should put all the necessary efforts in place. The position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is clear. After discussions and equivocations, the PPE Group is, today, in favour of the financial transaction tax. We would like the tax to be as comprehensive as possible, but, as the PPE Group is realistic, we know that this is not possible in the current climate. We would like the tax to be adopted at European level and that it not be implemented at a lower level, as this would certainly be detrimental to the European financial economy. We must not look the other way: if there were no European internal market – the European market forms a single entity and, personally, I do not believe in running away from things – if it falls to a lower geographical level, there is a real risk.

 Mr President, Mr Fox, we should always be optimistic. Anything can happen. They may see the light. I think that when faced with reality, with the problems of the economic crisis and the need to obtain financial means in a fair way, and also to avoid speculation and ensure the reform of financial activity, everyone can see that this tax would be useful. To reiterate my view, I would like this tax to be established at European Union level. If is it necessary to go in at a lower level, it must not go too low geographically, so as not to create distorted competition, which would be detrimental. I hope that the Member States who are not currently in favour of it will see the light. I am counting on Mr Šemeta’s conviction to drive this report forwards, and I encourage him to do so.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Commissioner, alongside the recovery of public finances, the question of growth is key to the success of the European strategy. In this regard, what is to be the role of the European Central Bank, which has shown extraordinary creativity during the financial crisis? Make no mistake. It is not a matter of making some completely unrealistic revision to the treaty. It is, in reality, about creating political conditions for the ECB to take the action it has undertaken further by buying sovereign debt on the secondary market and injecting liquidity into the financial system. Experience shows that this is possible within the existing legal framework without undermining the independence of the ECB or backtracking on its objectives. It is a question of European solidarity and political will, and not of legal provisions. However, recovery of public finances and prevention of the risk of crises remain a priority. Economic governance of the euro area is being strengthened. Mechanisms for the detection, prevention and sanction of abuses have been reinforced by the ‘six-pack’ initiative. The ‘two-pack’ initiative is under negotiation and there must be a conclusion on this subject soon. This negotiation must particularly make it possible to develop effective, practical measures for the benefit of Member States in difficulty or whose deficits are excessive. In this regard, we must ensure that democratic control is exercised as normal at European level to make the steps to be taken in this area acceptable to the people, the citizens. I would like to conclude by stressing that it would be desirable for the Commission’s proposal to be supplemented by legal protection for any Member State in extreme difficulty – not to encourage complacency but, on the contrary, to allow them to recover and meet their obligations. This provision should be controlled by the Commission under the supervision of the Council and Parliament. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the draft directive aims to implement within the European Union a common consolidated corporate tax base, known as the CCCTB. This has been under discussion since 2004. Today, Parliament, having been asked for its opinion and by way of Marianne Thyssen’s report, wishes – or in any case, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wishes – to send a strong message encouraging the Commission to continue its work in this area. The implementation of a CCCTB in the European Union offers many benefits, both for economic operators – by removing tax obstacles from the internal market – and for Member States – by enabling more transparent and therefore healthier tax competition between Member States. The report, voted through by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and presented by Ms Thyssen, is excellent. After lengthy negotiations and skilful identification of how best to address a very delicate issue, that is to say, the voluntary or optional nature of the system, she is proposing – and has reached agreement on – a phased transition, with the regime becoming immediately compulsory for European companies and cooperatives, to be extended to all companies with the exception of SMEs after five years, following review by the Commission. Commissioner, I believe the Commission should be more demanding in this area. I know the proposal is not strongly supported by several Member States, either due to a principled opposition, such as that of the United Kingdom, to complete tax harmonisation, or due to fears that would be provoked by implementation of this system. This is the stance of Poland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, for example. It must be disregarded. It is crucial for the European Union that this consolidated base, which does not involve a harmonisation of taxes, is implemented. That is the view taken of your proposal by the PPE Group.

Mr President, President Van Rompuy, first of all, let me congratulate you on your reappointment, Mr Van Rompuy. I am among those who, since you were first appointed, have been trying to explain to citizens that your task is a difficult one. I hope that you will continue to execute it with just as much persistence. I know that it is difficult. Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about citizens. I am sorry to have to say today that Europe is losing its credibility. I will not get involved in the national electoral battle: this is neither the time nor the place for that. One may, however, ask why such statements may be publicly accepted. Due to the fact that they are not rejected by public opinion, they are adopted by a very large majority simply because our fellow citizens no longer have any faith in Europe. It may be possible to exercise faith in certain areas. However, I believe that for Europe, what we need is reality. Today, I admire all those who, every month, or every week, make their speeches once again to say the same thing, and I pity those who write them, because what our citizens are looking for is action, and not words. We should spend less time speaking and more time taking action. Today, there are various causes behind the weakening of Europe. The first is, clearly, the way that the crisis has led to nations turning in on themselves. Each country is seeing things only from its point of view, looking at what is going on nationally without taking into account the European dimension, which is the only one that might save us. The second cause is the weakening of the Commission. The Commission appears silent. I am not saying that the Commission is not doing anything: it is working, but no one notices what it is actually doing because there is no clear plan. What is missing is a small package of specific actions that would allow citizens to compare what has been announced with what has been done. Let us take the case of Greece. It is very clear that Greece’s situation is tragic. Why are we giving the impression that it has now been resolved? It has not. One problem has been resolved to allow the plan to work, but in another year or two, problems will arise once again, because strong measures need to be taken. In addition, in the ‘two-pack’ that has been mentioned, I am proposing a safeguard measure for countries in difficulty. However, I was told by the Commission that it was an attack on the market. In fact, when you talk to the markets, what they want is to know where we are going and how we are getting there. They want to stick with the measures that have been taken, and not to change them every fortnight. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, first of all, I would like to say here that I think what is in the treaty could very well appear in European law, and on this point I believe I am in agreement with the Commission. This was said just now by President Barroso, when he stated that the Commission is making proposals to include a number of parties. Therefore, I do not intend to withdraw anything at all. I believe that we need rigour. Only a fool builds his house on the sand. If we now want to get the situation back on track, we must simultaneously balance rigour and growth. Growth, however, is not to be sought in newspaper articles or theories. Growth must be found in innovation, in entrepreneurship, in the mobilisation of entrepreneurs and in confidence. That is what we should work on together. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, every year, the Annual Growth Survey allows us to define the European Union’s economic and budgetary priorities and actions. I should first like to thank the Commission for having published its report before the end of November, thus allowing Parliament to carry out, in good time, some painstaking work. We would like this schedule to become permanent, so that Parliament has time enough to express its views before annual economic guidelines are decided upon by the Spring European Council. This year, on the occasion of the review of this report, Parliament wishes to strongly urge Member States to implement effectively those measures required by the policies that they themselves have undertaken to pursue. Obviously, the primary aim of these measures should be to find a way out of the sovereign debt crisis. They should go hand in hand with a growth strategy based on improving competitiveness. It is clearly also important to promote a sustainable economy which creates jobs. Parliament agrees with the Commission’s analysis that efforts at national and EU level should concentrate on the following five priorities: pursuing differentiated growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, while ensuring economic recovery and job creation; ensuring long-term financing of the real economy; promoting sustainable growth through more competitiveness and investments; tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis, and, finally, modernising EU public administration and services of general interest. As regards fiscal consolidation, Member States should pursue differentiated strategies according to their budgetary situations and keep their public expenditure growth below the rate of medium-term trend GDP growth. Member States must prioritise, on the expenditure and revenue sides of the budget, growth-friendly policies, particularly in the areas of education, research, innovation, infrastructure and energy, and ensure the efficiency of such expenditures and revenues. As regards ensuring the long-term financing of the real economy, Parliament welcomes the determined efforts by Commissioner Barnier to overhaul the regulation and supervision of the financial sector. If investor confidence is to be restored, the banks’ capital positions must be strengthened and measures must be taken to support their access to funding. Thirdly, the promotion of sustainable growth presupposes an increase in the competitiveness of investments. In this respect, Parliament is worried by the macro-economic imbalances within the EU and the fact that many Member States are falling behind in terms of productivity. Enhanced coordination of economic policies as well as structural reforms are needed to tackle these problems in both deficit and surplus countries in an adequate way. Modernising EU public administration and services of general interest is also a determining element of competitiveness and an important productivity factor. In future, Parliament wishes to be more closely involved in drawing up the main political and economic guidelines. It should be noted that the European Semester is now part of EU secondary legislation. The economic governance legal framework provides the tool of economic dialogue to enhance the dialogue between the EU institutions and to ensure greater transparency. We are anxious for this to be so, and I shall conclude shortly after the various speeches to be made, in the two minutes that remain to me, Mr President. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, this is certainly not the best time to speak. However, I, too, would like to commend the excellent cooperation between the rapporteurs, Ms Cornelissen, Ms Berès and myself and the shadow rapporteurs. On the substance of the debate, I would like to say that what is needed today is for words to be backed up by actions, and that is undoubtedly the hardest thing to achieve. As regards its form, I would like to point out that the 2012 European Semester will be the first to come under the new legal framework of enhanced economic governance. In order to ensure that Parliament is well informed, we urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the Commission provides a detailed assessment of the implementation, by the Member States, of the recommendations in each country. The Council, for its part, is required to provide a public explanation of its position within the framework of economic dialogue with Parliament, when its position deviates significantly from the Commission’s recommendations and proposals. It is quite clear that the States can retain a degree of discretion under the principle of subsidiarity. The new legal framework stipulates that Parliament must be duly involved in the European Semester in order to increase transparency and accountability for decisions, particularly through economic dialogue, as provided for by the relevant secondary legislation. In this respect, I should like to conclude by reminding you of the requests made by Parliament to the Council and the Commission in its resolution of 1 December 2011. It is important to give this resolution a precise public response. The reality and effectiveness of the democratic control for which this Parliament is responsible depends on it. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you know how much I appreciate your actions and everything you are doing. The issue we are dealing with this evening is important. It happens that I was rapporteur for the directive on payment services in the previous mandate. I therefore know how important it is to work towards harmonising payment services across Europe. This evening, allow me simply to discuss one issue which angers people: multilateral interchange fees. From the beginning, I have defended these fees and I had the opportunity to do so when we launched the first SEPA transfer in 2007. Interchange fees are legitimate. What is not legitimate is setting them at rates which are excessively high. Why are these fees legitimate? They are legitimate because payment services are a commercial service. The institutions, that is, banks or payment institutions established under Title II of the directive I mentioned just a moment ago, must undertake commercial activity. It is therefore normal that they should receive remuneration. This must obviously be justified by the service provided and, from this point of view, interchange fees — it is true — were, for a certain period of time, set unduly high. However, today, things have changed and the situation we are arriving at thanks to this new text, this regulation, is something of a paradox. Firstly, this text regulates an issue which was under discussion in the Court of Justice of the European Union; it authorises interchange fees at national level until 2017. It bans them sooner for cross-border operations but allows interchange fees to operate if payment is refused or rejected. None of that is very consistent. We must not let what has been done this time serve as an example for the coming regulation on bank cards. Reflection must be better led in this area and the fact that only six countries have resorted to using interchange fees does not mean to say that they are useless. Why? Because otherwise there is no transparency; we would pay for payment services using other means of payment, for example, cheques. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Madam President, Commissioner, Ms Matera, may I say, first of all, that we fully support Ms Matera’s line of argument concerning whether or not the decision to end the crisis derogation was justifiable, and I would like to thank her for all the work she has carried out in this area. I also share your view, Commissioner, on the disastrous impact it will have on the EU’s image if this measure is stopped despite its proven effectiveness. I should like to return briefly to the Renault case – and I also speak on my behalf of my colleague Mr Riquet, who is unable to be here today for personal reasons – in order to say that I also share your assessment of this issue. This case has had its ups and downs, no doubt due to the fact that two aspects have been mixed up: the question of which measures are eligible under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), and the strictly French issue of voluntary early retirement. As you said, there has been a kind of overlapping between the initial agreement and pension reform in France, which extended the period during which workers have to contribute, leaving a number of workers – the number of these varies, as does the time frame – concerned about their future. We share that concern, and it so happens that both Mr Riquet and I are deputies for the constituencies where the affected Renault factories are located. I can assure you that we have spared no effort in trying to encourage Renault to see reason. Just yesterday, I spoke on the phone to the head of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Health, who read Renault’s commitments to me. I believe they are serious about those commitments, but I can guarantee that, at local level, we will make every effort to make sure that the workers affected by this pensions problem – which you said is not directly part of this issue – can see a proper solution to their situation. On the basis of these observations I would call on all my colleagues to grant this assistance to Renault. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 I did not realise that this was what the Commission was proposing. My understanding is that the Commissioner said that he regretted this decision and was going to ensure that borderline cases could be studied in accordance with the criteria in force, but taking account of this crisis situation, which, he said – it seems to me – was going to continue and was going to continue to affect unemployment, unfortunately. That is why I said just now that I was in full agreement with the analysis of the Commissioner and the rapporteur on these matters and that this decision by the Council conveyed entirely the wrong message and gave Europe a very bad image in a difficult period for workers.

 Explanations were given to me just yesterday afternoon by the French Ministry of Labour, the Minister of which was taking steps to enable progress to be made on this issue under, it seems to me, less than pleasant conditions. The issue of pensions has in fact arisen in other French companies and has been resolved, notably at Michelin, for example, which does not come across as an allegedly left-leaning company. What is shocking – and I want to make this clear here and now – is that Renault, 17% of the capital of which is held by the government, has expressed some reservations. However, yesterday I wanted to make sure that these commitments had been made. These commitments – which were read out to me over the telephone, but which I did not get in writing – aim to ensure that people who do not receive an income because of an increase in the necessary contribution periods as a result of pension reform in France can have their contribution shortfalls compensated for, in particular through offers of temporary work. However, on humane grounds, this solution does not seem to me to be very satisfactory. That is why I said that, at local level – because I am in contact with the prefect of the region, and I am fully prepared to work with Ms Grelier to resolve this issue – I believe that, despite our political differences, we both have the same concern that workers who lose their jobs, who entered into an agreement contractually concluded when the situation was different, do not have their rights eroded because of subsequent changes to the legislation. I am perfectly willing to fight this fight, along with Ms Grelier, but I hope it will not come to that. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, of course, I shall say, like most of my fellow Members, that the Polish Presidency has been a success, and has worked effectively over a difficult period. However, contrary to what has just been said, perhaps the high point of this Presidency is the speech looking back over it that you have just given, Prime Minister. You encouraged us with utmost lucidity and a sense of realism – let me remain within the atmosphere of yesterday evening’s Polish Christmas dinner – to examine our consciences. This is something that we do less and less. Everyone shows their satisfaction, self-satisfaction or indulges in self-praise while you, today, asked some hard questions. However, the European Parliament also needs to examine its conscience. It is not enough to demand greater powers, greater cooperation and greater presence. We, too, have to be capable of a rapid and effective response if we are to survive within our institutional environment. I think that we shall have the opportunity to do so over the next few days with the growth report. I happen to have been tasked with the own-initiative report and we are going to suggest that Parliament be allowed to intervene and make proposals in relation to the Commission’s proposals, either to support them or to suggest new approaches. Today, the time has come to have a renewed democracy and Parliament must have a place within it. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this work that has just been done deserves to be highlighted and also deserves to be recognised for what it is. The work that has been done is an example of excellent cooperation with the rapporteur, Ms Berès, and I believe that tomorrow’s vote will show that it expresses the will of the vast majority of this House. Why is this the case? Because at stake here is the democratic scrutiny of procedures aimed at improving economic integration and cooperation among States. Clearly, Parliament is not asking to be an executive, nor is it asking to take the place of the national parliaments. However, everyone has a part to play at his or her respective level. The merit of this own-initiative report, which is perhaps a little longer than normal, is that it proposes practical solutions for this association, by adopting two points of view. Firstly, the point of view of the current Treaty, of the current rules. The rapporteur makes proposals on how to increase Parliament’s involvement so as to ensure democratic scrutiny. However, the report also reflects on the possibility of amending the Treaties and, at that point, indicates the improvements or the changes that should be made to guarantee this effective democratic scrutiny, which guarantees the legitimacy of the measures taken and negotiated at European and individual Member State levels. I should like to return to two specific points that were raised a moment ago, starting with the subcommittee on the euro. We have abandoned it so as not to create a divide among MEPs, but this report rightly points out that, when the time comes, Parliament will have to adapt to the structure adopted by the Member States within the Council or within the euro area. There is also the quasi-legislative, or quasi-codecision, issue. We must be practical and implement, on the basis of the Annual Growth Survey, a mechanism that allows Parliament to give its opinion, vote on amendments and, as the rapporteur was saying earlier, ensure that our President has a proper democratic mandate. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, Mr Juncker, I obviously agree with what was said by Mr Daul, Mr Langen and Mr Mauro, so I will not go back over the same ground. I want to talk to you about something else, about what citizens understand. Last night, I was with a hundred or so citizens who were asking me about the crisis, as, unfortunately, it is one of the issues that I am dealing with. What we need to do now for Europe is win the citizens over and, above all, get them on side. You have two categories of citizens: those who give in to the lure of populism and who scream and shout ‘Europe is a failure; Europe is good for nothing’; and then you have all the other citizens, larger in number, who say ‘We expect a lot from Europe, but Europe is not convincing us in what it is doing’. It is therefore our job to convince these citizens together. What is more, I say convince the citizens before convincing the markets. I have heard endless talk about the markets; I know the markets and I know them professionally. Has nobody ever told you that the markets will never be satisfied? They will always ask for more. There is a change of government in Italy, and now they are saying that it needs guarantees that it will do this or that. When it has done this or that, they will ask it to do something else. The politicians need to regain control. The markets are useful. The economy needs them. They allow it to work. However, they should not take advantage. When I see the Commission back down, yesterday, on the credit rating agency project, on innovative proposals which, in my opinion, did not go far enough, this is no way to convince the markets. This is proof that we are all weak, that we give in to those who put pressure on us, forgetting that we are here to serve the citizens. You can count on this Parliament. I have just heard that Mr Schulz endorsed the ‘Six Pack’, which he did not vote for. That just proves that here, once you have voted, you are able to follow the Commission, to help it. Mr Barroso, you have just said ‘Help us!’ Does Parliament not help the Commission to move Europe forward? Then let us all be courageous and brave together. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, I note from the Commissioner’s speech that the Semester has been a success. I can only be pleased about that. With Europe in the throes of a major crisis, this tool, as it is called, needs to help move the situation forward. I should like to address, in particular, the Council representative. It took you 16 minutes to explain the mechanism, which we were familiar with, and to tell us that all this is very technical, that it is ultimately too much for one to understand and that, if Parliament wants to be informed, then it is in luck, because it can consult the documents that are updated for the general public online. You might also tell us to read the newspapers, which we do as a matter of course. I find it quite shocking that the only response to the question that was asked about Parliament’s role in the European Semester was that we should read the newspapers and search the Internet and we will learn just as much about it. You know, when we meet our fellow citizens – and I wonder whether you ever have cause to meet them yourself – they ask us: ‘What is Europe doing with regard to these issues?’ Until now, we would tell them: ‘Ah, we have developed the European Semester!’ Well today, the European Semester is a damp squib. That is what I wished to say to you, Mr Dominik. The method that has been applied excessively for some months now is certainly not one that will enable Europe to overcome the crisis. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, what we need to do is to restore confidence: to restore the confidence of the public, to restore the confidence of economic operators, and to restore the confidence of the markets. We will not convince the markets by endlessly proposing to increase the funds mobilised for bailouts. On the contrary, we will weaken our position. We will not convince the markets by announcing, day in day out, measures that are not enforced. We will not convince the markets by showing that the banks need to be recapitalised but not indicating how or why. We will not convince the markets with rules that, once decreed, are not applied. This is the case where rating agencies are concerned, Commissioner. The three main rating agencies are still not accredited, are still not supervised, and continue to put an excessive strain on the financial markets. It is therefore time to do something to convince the markets, Commissioner. The European institutions need to solve the real crisis, that of policy making. It is up to the President of the Commission and you to adhere strictly to the principles that you have defined and with regard to which you have the support of Parliament.  (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, a few days ago, I told you, in a friendly way, a number of things. You have not missed today’s opportunity. We heard – at last, I would say – these strong words that are necessary if we want to address the political decision crisis that we are in, for beyond the economic, financial and social crisis that you described, and the confidence crisis, there was and is a political decision crisis. By asserting today loud and clear the Commission’s role and its constructive proposals – of which some have already been implemented, on financial regulation in particular – and thanks to this Parliament, thanks to what will be voted for later on I hope, and thanks to the joint work that we will once again undertake – like Mr Schulz said earlier on – I think that we can make Europe move forward in the right direction and give you all the support you need, and that, henceforth, you fully deserve. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).  
– (FR)
 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Minister, the current uncertainty over the EU’s response to the crisis is particularly harmful, firstly for the countries concerned, but also for the markets, on which the pressure is becoming unbearable and dangerous. I would like to raise a purely technical issue in relation to this point. Since we recognise that a Member State may default, it is now crucial to define rules to govern this situation. When a business becomes insolvent, there are exceptional rules to protect it. However, there are no such rules for Member States, because it has long been accepted that Member States cannot default. Yet, the example of Greece clearly shows that constant pressure on a Member State prevents planned measures from being implemented effectively. It follows that the European Union must decide, within the framework of the euro area, which rules shall prevail. Membership of the euro area creates an original and ambiguous situation for every Member State: it is no longer the one issuing its currency, but its financial policy is still out of sync with that of the other countries. Clearly, the first imperative is the rapid completion of the economic policy coordination arrangements and of the European Stability Mechanism, but we also need to establish the rules that will apply in this area. In the case of countries under arrangements with the European Union or the International Monetary Fund, this would involve introducing provisions to freeze clauses concerning early repayment, forfeit of terms or credit events, which are today standing in the way of a genuine recovery. Introducing such provisions would ensure both transparency and credibility. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to use an image much loved by the Commissioner, this is a new brick in the regulatory and supervisory system that he is courageously and effectively putting in place. A new brick, and soon there will be another one, with short selling. To ensure that those bricks are firmly in place, however, we need the Council’s agreement, and that is why I believe we should make the most of the coming days in order to try to make a success of a trialogue that will enable us to reach a decision at first reading. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is in favour of postponing the vote on the legislative resolution until the next part-session. Doing so will give the negotiators time to reach a proper agreement. As Mr Langen, who has done a remarkable job in this difficult affair, said, this agreement specifically deals with the role of, and supervision by, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). ESMA is a key element in this financial regulatory system that has been established. The conditions must be in place, at European level, for that authority to carry out all aspects of its role, which is very important in this case. On the issue of scope, we support the rapporteur’s proposal to limit it to over-the-counter derivatives and their markets; it is also important to consider the issues of interoperability and of third countries. I would also point out that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in an effort to be practical, believes that there is no point in imposing the provisions retrospectively, except, perhaps, in the case of transactions that are carried out over a long period of time. This system is difficult and complicated, but it is vital if we are to prevent a repeat of the financial crises we have gone through. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Mr President, I have a comment and a request to make. My comment is to emphasise that, thanks to Mr Stolojan’s work, we have been able to reach an agreement at first reading; I hope that this dossier will encourage the Council to successfully conclude the negotiations on the three other dossiers. Then I would like to ask you, Mr President, to give the floor to Mr Bodu. He mixed up the texts before and was supposed to take the floor on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs. I am making this request as coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, having listened to this debate as a layman, I think that we need to show some common sense in this affair. When crises occur, the citizens are the ones who directly or indirectly pay the consequences. I believe that when they realise the absurdity of selling something that one does not own, or of insuring against a risk for which one is not liable, they understand that this is an inappropriate system. I believe that we should try today to apply some common sense to this complex financial legislation, so that the human spirit is back at the heart of this work, instead of computer programs that are all configured in the same way to ensure that, when ridiculous transactions take place, no one really understands what is going on. I believe that Parliament has adopted some reasonable positions, and I hope that the Council will support them. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of this text is clearly to protect private investors from the fraudulent or deeply flawed practices of investment firms. This text is designed to increase confidence after a crisis in which retail investors, as you said, Commissioner, were definitely the most vulnerable stakeholders and the ones who suffered the most. It is important to understand that this text provides for the payment of compensation as a last resort. It is not paid out on an ad hoc basis, but as a last resort. That is why our committee unanimously adopted this report, which seeks to fully harmonise the rules and to increase the ceiling to EUR 100 000. In the specific case of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), the Commission’s feeling was not that measures to protect investors should be overlooked, but that this very specific product, which, incidentally, has an excellent reputation, deserved its own rules to be laid down as part of the revisions of the UCITS Directive. That is why the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has asked your Commission to undertake a study to discover what the advantages and disadvantages would be of extending the scope of this Directive on compensation for private investors to include UCITS. It is now up to the Council to agree so that the text that we adopted at first reading – since we will also be voting on the legislative resolution – can quickly be applied. I repeat: for Europeans and private investors, there is also a feeling of belonging to the European Union which must take the form of equivalent protection for all. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, many comments have already been made on the different reports that make up this governance package. What are the most important points, at this stage, to help us appraise the work that has been done? The fact that we have this package today, which is the result of negotiations between the Council and Parliament, already constitutes considerable progress. It fills an obvious gap in the development of the euro, and sadly it took the debt crisis to prompt us to do this. In this respect, we should stress the commendable work done by the Hungarian Presidency and the quality of the negotiators from this Parliament. I would also like to emphasise the results that Parliament obtained in the discussions with the Council, as the latter demonstrated genuine openness. We must remember how the situation used to be and measure the improvements objectively. Having said this, are these provisions satisfactory, and are they enough? There is always room for improvement, of course, but this package already provides real solutions to strengthen the euro area and to create the concerted economic approach that is needed. Can we seriously argue, as the opponents of this package do, that we can build growth on top of a mountain of debt that is continuously put off further and further into the future? To those who blame us for supporting a governance package that is not based on any theoretical or econometric model, I will simply say this: did the models you are talking about foresee or prevent the crisis we are going through and that has not ended yet; or did they lead, instead, to high-risk behaviours under the cover of mathematical truth? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow Parliament will have to make its decision, and I hope it will send out a signal loud and clear, both to our citizens, to restore their confidence in Europe, and to the markets, to stabilise our currency.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I rise on behalf of Mrs Lulling and Mr Langen, too; they had their own speaking time, but I assure you that I will not use it all up. I would just like to point out, as every one of you has done here, that the process of selecting a new Managing Director of the IMF has begun. It is important for the European Union to express a unanimous and strong position that is conveyed not only by the various Member States, but also by the Commission, and you have pledged to do that, Commissioner. Many of us in this House, with the exception of Mr Farage, are very keen to see the balance – a popular one until now – between the United States and Europe maintained during the process of appointing the Managing Director of the IMF and the President of the World Bank. We fully understand that emerging countries – particularly the largest ones – would like more of a say in the IMF’s decision making. It is important, therefore, to continue the reforms under way regarding the governance of that international institution, and particularly the ones that you also mentioned, Commissioner. However, it is definitely too soon for any radical changes to the balance achieved as a result of the Member States’ respective financial contributions to the Fund. Only one European candidate has launched a proper campaign by making contact with the various Member States. That candidate – who, by the way, is a woman – has the qualities required. Her skills, political experience, moral authority and perfect command of English, coupled with her experience of working across the globe, make her the ideal candidate for the post of Managing Director of the IMF. As has been said, the Managing Director must be someone who seeks consensus and is effective at a time when the institution has a vital role to play in helping to redress the economic and financial balance with a great sense of purpose. Our Union must therefore do whatever it takes to secure Christine Lagarde’s appointment. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, as you acknowledged just now, last year’s tests have not had the anticipated effects. We ought to avoid the same errors of conception and implementation. The fields of investigation must be consistent and similar. There will be no stabilisation if the diagnosis is not correct. Governments must be aware of that. This being so, the tests must quite clearly be realistic. The solutions that you have just given us, in a particularly detailed fashion, are of a kind that can provide an answer to our questions. It is now the job of the European Banking Authority, in supervising and examining the conclusions of these tests, to give a first test of its effectiveness. The tests must allow us to better define the potential recapitalisation needs of the banks and to take the measures that you have just mentioned. However, performing credible stress tests is the best way to calm the financial markets and to limit the influence of credit rating agencies and the negative effects of their decisions on the whole of our economy. The credibility of the results of these tests can end the dependency on these agencies, or at least can reduce it. The supervisory authorities have no choice but to ensure that the tests are successful; that is, that they provide convincing evidence. Let me use my allotted time, Commissioner, to draw your attention to the fact – in my opinion, a serious one – that the legislation relating to credit rating agencies, which has now entered into force, has not been applied, and that the authorities to which these agencies submitted their files did not take steps to inform them of the requirements of the agreement. We planned a transitional period pending the establishment of the European Securities and Markets Authority, yet today we are continuing to act as if nothing had happened. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, after the remarks that I have just heard, which are unworthy of this House, I should like to tell you that the majority of us believe that the EIB’s action is very positive. The improvements made by the Treaty of Lisbon provide new scope for action, which should help the EIB to become even more effective and to provide relevant solutions to the global financial crisis. As you emphasised, the EIB provides real support to small and medium-sized enterprises and makes a crucial contribution to the EU’s cohesion policy convergence objective. Those actions must be pursued and, if possible, increased. The EIB must do more to promote strategic investments in Europe, and so I should like to invite you to support those who have taken initiatives to improve long-term financing and, in particular, deposit and consignment offices − the caisse des dépôts
 and cassa dei depositi
 − and KfW. I believe that they should be supported, because the banking regulations and accounting regulations that are developed today do not encourage us to factor in long-term investment and penalise those who opt for it. Moreover, contrary to what is often said, we need changes and not just adaptations. Long-term financing is, as you also said, essential in order to open up a new horizon for Europe. Outside the European Union, you are right to say that the EIB must act as a driving force and hence must propose initiatives, in particular, for the financing of the Mediterranean countries. In the current turbulent conditions affecting a good many of those countries, the EIB can make a useful contribution to economic development within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean through its targeted financing, and can thus help to establish democratic civilisation in those countries whose future is still uncertain. I have noted your willingness to make that contribution if the Union asks you to do so, which I hope it will. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. 
– (FR)
 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I agree, of course, with what Mr Brok said. I should just like to draw attention to two points: the important thing today is to have legal certainty. In other words, there should be no ongoing debate regarding the legal bases of action that may be taken at European level, whether it be intergovernmental or Community action; our preference, of course, is for Community action. Why do we need this legal certainty? Because Europe and the euro area are under constant pressure from the markets. We cannot destroy the markets but we can try to bring them under control. To do so, we must eliminate uncertainty, the decisions that are put off each day, and we must stop constantly wondering whether or not we can take decisions. It is therefore a matter of urgency, Commissioner, for you to heed Parliament’s requests and for us to quickly amend the Treaty so as to guarantee this legal certainty, which is necessary in order to respond effectively to the difficult economic circumstances we are facing. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, I regret that there is some confusion in this report by Mrs Podimata, which raises a number of important issues with regard to innovative financing. I would like to ask the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament to withdraw the alternative motion it has tabled so that the joint drafting work that has been carried out can be concluded. Secondly, I regret that a slightly artificial opposition has emerged on the issue of a tax on financial transactions and that there are two very similar amendments. I regret that, as a result, Parliament cannot express its overwhelming support for this tax in conditions that are reasonable with regard to Europe’s competitiveness. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).  
– (FR)
 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot but endorse what has just been said by Mrs Goulard on the basic presuppositions that mean that while we are well aware of the need for effectiveness and speed in the decision-making process, it is essential for Parliament to be involved. This is the only way in which our fellow citizens, of whom we are the elected representatives, can understand what is happening and explain it to them. I would like to raise one very specific point. We are buffeted, on a daily basis, by the financial markets, these financial markets, which stand for everything and for nothing, are most often inhabited by young people who have moved from Game Boy
 to computer without thinking too much about it, and yet who strike fear into the hearts of our countries. The way to bring the markets under control is not to eliminate them. I do not belong to a group that seeks to abolish the markets. However, what do the markets seek? They seek to avoid risk and the rule of the game in the markets is to pass risk on to someone else. This means that an operator will never feel happy as long as there is risk. I feel that if we are to have an impact on these financial markets, Europe must be able to draw some very clear lines, not change direction every other day, and not bubble with hosts of ideas which are never, subsequently, put into practice. If we want to bring this financial aspect under control, and this is vital for the economic stability of our countries, we need to be able – and it is your role, Mr Barroso, to provide this impetus – to set clear goals, clear measures and to show a clear determination in regard to good economic coordination. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to make two comments in relation to form: the rapporteur has just acknowledged all those who contributed to this report. This work was indeed a real team effort, in which our group member, Mrs Hübner, was particularly involved as shadow rapporteur. However, I have learned that the socialist group has submitted an alternative resolution, which means that a document on which there has been no consultation shall be put to the vote first. My second political comment – I do not usually make such comments – is that we are creating an artificial opposition here, especially with regard to the tax on financial transactions. The position of our group is clear: we are in favour of such a tax at global level; we are in agreement with it being trialled in Europe if it cannot be trialled globally. We simply feel that we cannot rush into this kind of decision without carrying out a thorough impact assessment in order to verify that the competitiveness of Europe’s financial centres will not be affected. In this regard, Commissioner, I would like to state clearly that the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is not to play for time, or to put matters on standby. We urgently and strongly request that the impact assessment which we have repeatedly discussed in this Parliament be duly and promptly carried out to allow us to make an informed decision on the matter. I think that, on the one hand, there is the hype which the opinion columns in some European newspapers serve to create, and, on the other, there is the real situation, where we have to manage this issue seriously by having a thorough knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages and making a political decision as quickly as possible. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, I will address an issue that has been raised on several occasions and often presented as a single reason: speculation. I believe that, with regard to speculation, moderation is required. It is clear that there is a definite link between certain financial activities and increased volatility and prices for raw materials. However, looking at the entire issue solely in terms of financial speculation would certainly be a mistake, since part of what we call speculation is actually the legitimate hedging of prices on the part of producers and, as we are well aware, these producers could not do without this hedging possibility. However, a situation must be avoided in which direct investment in commodities has a harmful impact on price volatility because of its massive scale or its purely speculative nature. In this regard, the proposals made by Commissioner Barnier on financial matters, in particular the regulation of short selling and derivatives, and also the revision that is going to come from the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), must give Parliament the opportunity to take account of aspects of commodities speculation in financial regulation and supervision, which will be put in place to ensure that those markets are also regulated in an effective yet pragmatic manner. Commissioner, you said that these efforts should continue, and I believe that Parliament which, in a financial crisis, has complied with and, sometimes, anticipated what the Commission proposed, will live up to its responsibility. Finally, I welcome the declaration of the Hungarian Presidency indicating that Europe would support the French Presidency of the G20, which has made the regulation of the commodities markets one of its priorities.

 Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Barnier, this debate right now is not a legal debate; it is a true political debate. It is a debate on the future of financial regulation in Europe. It is the culmination of one aspect of the work conducted by Parliament, with the Council, under the guidance of the Commission. I am therefore going to be quite clear. For us, it is not about indulging in some sort of revolution or showing our biceps just for fun. It is about ensuring that the spirit that presided over the agreements between the Council and Parliament is, in fact, respected. It is not a lesson in law. The texts do not matter. We know the texts. What matters is the way in which these texts will be put into effect. In this regard, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the clarity of his speech. We have never sought to call the Commission into question, and the words spoken by the Commissioner are totally in accordance with the wishes of Parliament. We are talking here about a political act that consists in saying: ‘These institutions have been established, so we must give them the concrete resources to function properly.’ Yet, I think that we do not simply have doubts but also suspicions about the way in which these provisions have in fact been implemented by a number of Member States, by those that wish to unravel European supervision and prevent financial regulation at European level. That is what we are speaking out against, because we believe that, if that had been the case, we would have been cheated in the negotiations on supervision. The negotiations were long; they were difficult. Everyone made compromises. The Belgian Presidency did some remarkable work and the Commissioner provided extraordinary impetus. Today, we could be faced with institutions without effective power: due to the low status of the staff appointed; due to the fact that the Member States did not choose the best, and perhaps because the salaries were not attractive. In any event, today Parliament needs a concrete answer. Minister, I am bound to say that, despite the friendship that I feel for you, having sat on the same bench, in the same group and on the same committee as you, the letter, which I have seen and which, I admit, is only a first draft, is inadequate. I will give you the response of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is simple. You say, on behalf of the Council, that you fully endorse what the Commissioner has just said. I can tell you that, for us, this will be a satisfactory declaration. The statement made by the Commissioner is precise. It deals with problems of human and financial resources. Your letter needs to state: ‘We agree with virtually everything the Commissioner said’. Mrs Győri, this is very important. We agree with virtually everything the Commissioner said in plenary this evening. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

(FR)
 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I have listened to this long debate as a citizen. I would say that Mr Barroso’s proposals were very interesting. We would like to see them acted upon. A clear and comprehensible political will and a discourse of truth are the necessary conditions for restoring our citizens’ confidence. It is imperative that we do not mask realities. There is public spending, which we must cover or reduce. There are public and private debts, which we must repay. There are numerous experts who have ideas on everything. Those who did not see the crisis coming are now full of brilliant solutions. But in a difficult situation, let us use common sense. Let us not reproduce in the management of public finances the mistakes and errors of the private sector that led to the financial and banking crisis. Sophisticated arrangements do not create value and wealth. They create illusions and often benefit only the speculators. The fact of the matter is that the Member States have lived beyond their means. We must have the courage to draw the necessary conclusions and ensure that the burden of recovery is apportioned fairly. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, this is a purely technical amendment, to take into account the date that the regulation establishing the European Securities and Markets Authority will come into effect and the fact that this regulation can only come into effect at a later date. We should consequently adapt one recital and one article of the text on which we are going to vote. In recital 22, we should cut the second sentence and in article two, I also suggest that we cut the second sentence. This oral amendment has been the subject of an item of information and an agreement by the different groups that signed the compromise agreement. This text we will be voting on today completes the regulation of rating agencies and is part of the European Union’s policy to improve the regulation of financial services. I should like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Barnier and the Belgian Presidency for their very strong involvement in this issue. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, here we are in the third act of the financial legislation for 2010. Following supervision, following the directive on alternative investment fund managers, we are once again looking at credit rating agencies. I say ‘once again’ because Europe has not been slow in bringing in a regulation in this area which was conceived in 2009 and which is now taking effect. Credit rating agencies, in general, issue opinions, literally in the form of ratings, on the creditworthiness of businesses and states and on complex financial products. The rating reflects an assessment of the risk of issuers of financial instruments not being able to honour their debts. These agencies have gradually become very important in the financial world, for a variety of reasons. First, ratings are taken into account in banking regulations in order to determine the amounts of own funds that will be used to back investments. The second reason is that ratings have been a factor in the success of issues, since they have become a major indicator for investors. Yet, although credit rating agencies were not the main cause of the recent financial crisis, they did have a harmful influence. Indeed, they underestimated the probability that issuers of certain complex financial instruments would default. Faced with the need to restore confidence in the markets and to strengthen protection for investors, in 2009, the European Commission proposed a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies. Thus, in the same year, Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies was adopted. During the debates in the European Parliament preceding the adoption of this regulation, your rapporteur stressed the need for EU-wide joint oversight of credit rating agencies’ products and integrated supervision of them. At the time, European supervision of this type was legally impossible. However, the Commission undertook to draft a legislative proposal along these lines, and you, Commissioner, kept this promise. The agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament on the architecture of European supervision, which will enter into force on 1 January 2011, now makes the effective implementation of rating agency supervision possible. It is stressed in the Regulation establishing the European Securities and Markets Authority that this authority will exercise its own supervisory powers in relation, in particular, to credit rating agencies. That was the objective of the additional amending regulation on which we reached an agreement and on which we will vote tomorrow. What I wanted – and my colleagues supported this request – was for the other issues relating to credit rating agencies, allocation of sovereign debt, remuneration schemes and competition, to be postponed and dealt with in a study taking the form of an own-initiative report, which will precede the legislative proposal that you are due to make in the first half of 2011 and for which you have launched a consultation. I believe that, by establishing European supervision of credit agencies, we are taking a big step along the same lines as the supervision arrangements that have been implemented. I now want to thank the Belgian Presidency for its tireless efforts on the financial dossiers, you and your teams, Commissioner, and, obviously, my fellow Members in the European Parliament who participated in this study and who supported our positions. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, after the comments that you have heard, you can draw two conclusions. The first is that Parliament will overwhelmingly support this report tomorrow, which will show once again that Parliament, or a large majority of it, appreciates the actions on regulation and supervision that are being taken by the Commission and which have been strongly supported by the Belgian Presidency. The second conclusion that we can draw is that I will not come to a conclusion today, but that a new debate will open up, on the basis of this consultation, of Mr Klinz’s own-initiative report, to examine all these difficult questions. Thus, we cannot avoid the fact that in 2009, when we brought about the first regulation, we were already asking ourselves these questions. If we have not dealt with these questions, it is because we have not found an appropriate response. I hope, therefore, that, thanks to the thought that is being given to the matter with the submission of Mr Klinz’s report, the discussion about consultation which is taking place will this time enable us to provide responses to complete the regulation on rating agencies. In conclusion, however, if you will allow me, I will repeat a phrase by the President of the Securities and Markets Authority, who said that, at the very least, it would be good if the financial markets detoxified themselves of the rating agencies to allow investors to gain a greater personal appreciation of situations and risks. I think that that would also be a guarantee. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I believe that I have one minute if what I have been told is correct. President-in-Office of the Belgian Presidency, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to say, Minister, how much I appreciated your lucid assessment of the latest G20 and how supportive I am of your proposals for the future. I think it really must be said that the results have been fairly poor, even though Basel III and the IMF reform were approved. We can only hope, like the President of the Commission, that the Seoul summit paves the way for the implementation of the French Presidency’s ambitious proposals, which are justified by immediate need and the ongoing difficult circumstances. The European Union will need to be consistent if it is to carry the weight it deserves. Concrete results are essential, and I agree with you, President of the Commission, when you say that our fellow citizens are expecting action and not mere words or statements. The globalisation of the economy and finance require us to make real progress in the international harmonisation of regulations. Markets react much quicker than politicians. Europe must not be naive and must ensure that there is reciprocity. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).  
– (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, as the coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to emphasise two points in your programme. Firstly, strengthening economic governance and initiating the European Semester. We were pleased to welcome the package on economic governance. Achieving this target is critical. In this respect, our group would like to see effective and binding measures that go further than what is being proposed. It is also necessary for Parliament to be truly involved in finalising the processes envisaged and in their implementation. Legal bases should be found to prevent the treaties from being substantially amended, which would only slow down the implementation of measures that must be taken. The second point concerns the continuation of the work on financial regulation. The projects are on the table, or will be soon. 2011 will be a decisive year. We appreciate Commissioner Barnier’s pro-activeness. In 2010, Parliament showed its determination in adopting the supervision package, the directive on alternative investment fund managers and, in all likelihood by the end of the year, the regulation that will set up the European supervision of credit rating agencies. We want to continue on the path of a pragmatic, intelligent and effective regulation. That is what we are expecting from the Commission today. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Trichet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, I join the chorus of praise for the ECB’s work, and I shall not repeat what my colleague, Mr Balz, said or what is said in the resolution. In the short time allotted to me, I would simply like to say that we must consider our fellow citizens. Why do I say that in this way today? Because, yesterday evening, on all the French television channels, a future presidential candidate made a spectacle of himself by tearing up a EUR 10 note that he had photocopied and enlarged, and showing that, by tearing up that note, he was tearing up the cause of all our ills. Of course, that is not true. All that is needed is for us to make an effort, together, to communicate. The work that has been carried out in terms of supervision, organisation and regulation, to which you have referred, Mr President, is excellent. You know you have Parliament’s support: you said so yourself. However, we have a real task on our hands with regard to those of our fellow citizens who do not understand the messages that are being conveyed. Every day, the headlines in the press are of increasingly grim solutions and unlikely situations, and I can tell you that, on Friday, when I was out in the field, as we say in politics, I saw nearly 100 to 150 people. They all asked me the same question: what is going to happen with the euro? The fear felt by our fellow citizens is out of sync with what is being done, and done well, by the European Central Bank. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote that you are going to cast concerns one of the key elements of Europe’s response to the financial crisis, namely, the regulation of alternative investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. This compromise document, this compromise text, has been long in the making. We have succeeded in reaching a broad agreement, and I should like to pay tribute here, before the ECOFIN President, to the Belgian Presidency, which has been directly and significantly involved in this matter, in particular, through the Minister’s active participation in key trialogues, and I should also like to thank Commissioner Barnier, whose work has been particularly useful. Lastly, I should also like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs, the Secretariat staff and the experts who assisted us. This work took more than 14 months, and there were 1 690 amendments. It was a lot of work, but I believe that today, we have come up with a text that, thanks to the Belgian Presidency, marks a significant step forward in the field of European financial regulation. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, the text we are debating this evening, and which will be put to the vote in Parliament tomorrow, is the result of a long period of work. On 30 April 2009, the European Commission published its proposal for a directive on alternative investment fund managers. It aims to establish a safe, harmonised framework at European Union level to monitor and supervise the risks presented by managers for their investors, their counterparties, other actors in the financial markets and financial stability, while making it possible for managers, subject to observing strict requirements, to provide services and market their funds throughout the internal market. Mr President, may I just pause a moment, I wanted to know whether, given the length of our work, I had no time limit, because I see that the clock has not started. It does not bother me but, for honesty’s sake, I wanted to draw it to your attention. Parliament received the text about 14 months ago. It has aroused obvious interest among Members of the European Parliament, as a record number of 1 690 amendments have been tabled. Professionals have been involved very extensively and the rapporteur has had nearly 200 discussions on this text, not counting the discussions with national authorities. Finalising the compromise text that is being debated today has been particularly hard work. Half a dozen informal trialogues took place under the Spanish Presidency during the first half of 2010 in order to facilitate the exchange of information on the progress of the work. No agreement was reached in the Council during this period. On 17 May 2010, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, by a large majority, voted in favour of the report, which was the result of collective deliberation by Members of the European Parliament. Parliament introduced proportionality, differing rules for different categories of funds, regulation to protect the private equity of target companies and jobs and a passport system for funds and alternative investment fund managers based outside of the European Union. There then followed a dozen trialogues. A working party was also set up between the three institutions specifically to deal with the technical aspects of the proposal in a number of meetings with the Belgian Presidency and the Commission. On 26 October 2010, the trialogue, which was to become conclusive, was held, with the active participation of the President of ECOFIN, Mr Reynders, and of Commissioner Barnier, and an agreement was reached on a compromise text which the rapporteur felt could be put to the vote in Parliament. I shall not go into the detail of this lengthy technical document but will highlight the essential points. The directive will make it obligatory for alternative investment fund managers located in the European Union to be authorised or registered, and to comply with operational and organisational requirements, codes of conduct and transparency rules, and will make them subject to the power of the competent authorities of the Member States and of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to supervise and to impose sanctions. It will give them access to the Union’s internal market by means of an intra-European passport to manage and market their products. Eventually, managers based outside of the European Union will be able to qualify for a passport provided they meet the same requirements as managers whose head office is in the European Union. The number of meetings and the intensity of exchanges and negotiations between the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, the Presidency at the time and the Commission have very significantly enriched the initial proposal in a number of areas. In this respect, I need to make it clear that the progress sought by Parliament was achieved gradually in the course of negotiations and not, of course, only in the last trialogue during which some adjustments were made, but at the political level, it was decisive. I would now like to emphasise the areas in which Parliament’s intervention has been decisive. First of all, on two highly political issues, with regard to relations with third countries, the existence and implementation of a passport – well, now I really do not understand because normally I have four minutes – for managers residing outside of the European Union have been approved. Specific conditions for the granting of a passport have been laid down. With regard to private equity, Parliament has succeeded in ensuring that the directive includes provisions to avoid potential asset stripping of the target company and also specific rules concerning reporting obligations in relation to target companies, their employees or their representatives. Given the erratic behaviour of the clock, I shall not go back over some of the provisions that were achieved in accordance with Parliament’s wishes. I shall simply say that Parliament would have liked to have gone further, but it was able to influence negotiations so as to give more recognition to the ESMA’s role. The solutions that were upheld nonetheless constitute significant progress towards improving monitoring at European level. Parliament has been careful to strengthen the powers of the Council and of Parliament in the process of adopting acts delegated by the Commission. A majority in Parliament would have liked very strict control over passive marketing, or even its prohibition. The inclusion in a recital of the principle whereby professional investors have to carry out due diligence when they invest in funds located outside of the European Union constitutes a significant first step. That, Mr President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, is what I wanted to say in opening the debate. In closing, I shall take this opportunity of two minutes to thank all those who have contributed to this success. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, earlier, I spoke about the technical details. Allow me to use my last two minutes to express some richly deserved thanks: thank you first of all to all the fellow Members who have spoken today. My especial thanks to those who have said that they will be supporting the text, but to those who will not be voting in favour, I do not believe that putting me in the same bracket as Mr Cameron is really an insult either. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the groups: Mr Goebbels, Mr Bullmann, Mr Canfin, Mr Klute, and Mrs Regner, the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. I wanted to name them all in recognition of the incredible support that they gave me during the first phase of this process. We were able to work together productively, each putting forward his or her own points of view, and I would like to thank them for that. I am delighted that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the European Conservatives and Reformists have joined us now that a compromise has been reached and hence, I am delighted that Mr Klinz and Mr Kamall have co-signed with me the amendment that replaces the initial report. Particular thanks go to Mr Barnier for his considerable involvement in this dossier: he knows how much I appreciate him. I know that he knows that Parliament is relying on him and will support him in putting in place these building blocks that are so dear both to him and to us. I know it is unusual, but I would also like to thank Ugo Bassi, with whom I have had a very fruitful working relationship during this time, and so the text is also the result of work done within the Commission. As for you, Minister, earlier I felt that you contributed something when, in your thanks, you asked whether we would continue to make progress. So let me begin by thanking you, because without you we would never have achieved anything on the Member States’ side. These are genuine thanks, not simply a polite gesture – I believe that your personal commitment has been key to the progress made in the Council and to the fact that we have reached an agreement. You have also succeeded in ensuring that all the main groups can identify with parts of the text and in obtaining the majority that we both wanted for this directive. My thanks also for the contributions from our fellow Members on the left, without whose support the directive would not have the credibility that I am confident it will have tomorrow after a very broad vote. As you pointed out, this was vital for supervision, and vital for this directive too. I am also very grateful to your teams, Minister; please pass on my thanks. Some of the debates were pretty lively, but although I now live in Normandy, I come from the south, and sometimes my southern temperament wins out over the more balanced Norman approach. I also wanted to say, Minister, President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council, that I really hope that we will complete our work on rating agencies before the end of the year. For our part, we have the committee vote on 22 November, the vote in Strasbourg in December, and then, if the Council is ready, we will be ready. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, in 1968, our fellow Member Mr Cohn-Bendit’s friends wrote, ‘words, not deeds’ on the walls of Paris. Today, citizens are asking for the opposite: deeds, not words. We are hearing a lot of words, but our fellow citizens are not seeing results. The European Union’s slowness to respond is not good enough given the imperatives we need to deal with. We need to move forward together, with a united European spirit. In this respect, I would like to say a word about the role of Parliament. Here too, there is still work to be done in terms of upholding the codecision principle. The President of the Commission thanked Parliament several times for its support, but Parliament is not here simply to play a secondary, support role, or to ratify decisions taken by the Council without having the chance to discuss them first. Parliament is on a par with the Council. It is time we recognised this, and the debate on economic governance will be a test in this respect. Finally, as regards the forthcoming G20 summit, the European Union must present a united front to ensure that this international body plays the role that is expected of it and does not merely indulge in endless talk. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, the Treaty of Lisbon unquestionably provides Europe with new social objectives. Sustainable development in Europe is based on the high competitiveness of the social market economy, which means full employment and social progress, the fight against social exclusion and discrimination, the promotion of justice and the eradication of poverty. The Treaty of Lisbon confirms the role of the social partners and promotes social dialogue between the trade unions and the representatives of employers’ organisations at European level. On these various points, the actual situation is certainly not the one described by some speakers here. Today, we can dramatise the situation; it is true that there are worrying situations, that the crisis is not yet over, and that it has consequences. However, Europe is taking measures in this area – which we must explain to our citizens – to create some order in the financial sector, in particular, and in this regard, it is one of the first to be making efforts to organise that sector, on the basis of our work. Allow me to make a few short remarks. On services of general interest in particular, I will say clearly that we should take specific national circumstances into account, because it is true that some of our fellow citizens are a little alarmed – I am thinking, for example, of the French – when they feel, wrongly, that Europe is endangering the public services which are a French tradition. Likewise, in relation to public contracts, we should take account of individual circumstances, and especially of those which allow for collaboration between several public authorities. Nevertheless, social policy is dependent on the health of the economy and on economic growth. That is the primary objective of a social market economy. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by briefly praising Mr Karas’ excellent work. I was one of the people who were in favour of an own-initiative report being produced before the Commission makes its proposals on the framework for transposing the Basel Agreement, and I am delighted that the work done by Mr Karas with the help of the various shadow rapporteurs has highlighted the main points for consideration. I will not repeat them here, Commissioner, and of course I welcome the points you make and your determination to ensure that this regulatory framework is effective and workable and above all that it creates no distortion of competition at international level. To move on to a different subject, I cannot help noticing that there is often a big difference between the statements that are made publicly and the commitment to these in practice. I also note that countries outside the European Union, and I am thinking of the United States in particular, have an irritating tendency to make value judgments about how we operate, whilst they themselves are not putting the systems into practice as they ought. As regards Basel, it is vital that European companies are dealt with on an equal footing and are not penalised more than US companies. In the United States, few banks are taking notice of these directives or of the Basel Committee and, at present, nothing is actually being put into practice. I would hate to see the provisions adopted in June to regulate US finance – the statements made about these exaggerate their real impact – being used as a legal basis for not applying the provisions which might be introduced by bodies outside the United States. Commissioner, I trust in what I know to be your total determination and vigilance to ensure that this does not lead to a distortion of competition for the French banks, the European banks, and for those who finance the economy in general. It is right that we should be steering the banks back towards their primary role of financing economic development, but we must make sure that they are not penalised disproportionately. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I recall a few years ago asking the then Competition Commissioner whether she was aware of any evaluation being carried out on the effectiveness for consumers of fines set, and on this matter, the then Commissioner indicated at the beginning of our committee meeting that she had managed to claw back so many million euro in fines. And so the answer was that it had not been considered. It would appear that since then, you have carried out studies to find out what damages were actually incurred. However, I would like to draw your attention to two matters. The first being that prices are fixed on the basis of a group’s turnover. However, the company that may have violated competition rules, and I am not condoning it, may be a relatively small company within the group. That is what bothers me, especially when there are separate legal entities involved. Secondly, Commissioner, and it is you who said so and not your colleague, you often talk about the need for prevention, saying that prevention is better than repression and, in any case, more effective. So the question I ask is whether these huge fines, which always make the front page of the newspapers in which they are delivered, really have any role in terms of prevention. And I wonder whether it might not be more effective in terms of prevention to focus more on the number of checks rather than on the level of fines. As has recently been the case in France, sentences can clearly be passed for sums of money requiring 4 or 5 000 years to be paid off. I think that we should not become fixated on these figures. We need to look specifically at the repercussions for the company, at a time of uncertain economic circumstances. Skewing the rules of competition is not right. It is quite right that a penalty is applied but this penalty needs to be truly proportional, which is why we wanted to know whether or not the Commission would amend its rules. I think you said that this would not be the case, which is a shame. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr Van Rompuy, first of all, I would like to say how happy I am to see that, on the question of the Roma, the positions for resolving the problems of poverty faced by these populations are balanced, reasonable and forward-looking. I would like to say to you, Mr Van Rompuy, that I appreciated your way of presenting the achievements of these last eight months. You presented them with vigour and precision. We do not say enough about Europe’s work, and neither do we say enough about the part Parliament plays in it. You spoke just now of collaboration, in particular, as it relates to supervision. This is good, because Parliament wanted agencies with a true European competence, which this supervision was able to introduce, because, as you know, the position of the Ecofin Council in December 2009 was much more reticent on this question. We must continue, at a time when the G20 will have a European Presidency, via France. We must say more, and we must say it stronger, with one voice. We must also have specific proposals for the future. We are counting on you, Mr Van Rompuy. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, I would, of course, like to add to all the congratulations offered and I would like to underline the work done and the excellent collaboration within this Parliament and also to remind you that without the will of Parliament, this supervision would certainly not have had the European characteristics that it has today. As far as the future is concerned, Mr Reynders, before the end of this period and perhaps even before the end of this month, I would like us to be able to reach an agreement on one of the subjects that concerns us to which you have dedicated yourselves, and not in vain I can assure you. In the coming days, thanks to the great minds of the Belgian Presidency, we will find a satisfactory solution on hedge funds and private equity. To repeat one of the Commissioner’s analogies, I think that we must add bricks to this framework that has just been outlined that will ensure that financial regulation is intelligent and affects all products. It is not about regulation for regulation’s sake. It is about trying to ascertain the effectiveness of regulation that is intended to limit as far as possible the risks inherent in the financial system. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Mr Wright who regrettably is leaving us. We hope that after all the work he has done to help Parliament achieve results, we will see him again soon on the European way. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I should naturally like to add my congratulations on the good result obtained in the area of supervision. As Mrs Goulard reminded us, Parliament’s effort has not been in vain, and in December something new and unique happened: a statement was issued by the four coordinators of the main groups saying that Europe needed to play a greater role in this supervision. Thanks to your dynamism, Mr Reynders, a good solution has been found. The Commission has clearly worked hard, and I welcome the financial services programme announced to us by Commissioner Barnier. It is fortunate that this happened, that this agreement was reached, because the EU’s financial credibility, its financial credibility in the eyes of our fellow citizens who, since the crisis have been asking us, ‘What is the EU doing? What concrete results have you achieved?’ is ultimately at stake. We can tell them that we are thinking about and working on this issue, that we are holding trialogues and meetings, but what they want is results. The EU’s credibility in the eyes of our international partners, particularly the US, is also at stake. I have recently been in contact with representatives from the US finance sector and, ultimately, what bothers them about the EU is this impression of legal uncertainty: we change regulations; we introduce revision clauses and sunset clauses; we do not build anything solid. I think that legislation must be definitive, albeit subject to amendment. We must not, above all else, give the impression that we are going to amend the texts two or three years down the road. Madam President, Mr Reynders, I should like to plead on my behalf: a very important trialogue will take place this afternoon with Commissioner Barnier and my colleagues on the regulation of hedge funds. It is essential that we find a solution soon. I am very conscious of the commitment on the part of the Belgian Presidency and of your personal commitment. We must reach an agreement over the next few weeks, so that next time you report on ECOFIN’s work, you will be able to say, ‘An agreement has been reached on the regulation of hedge funds.’ We are counting on this, and I know that you also are counting on it. We must now take the final step so that the right solution can be found. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, credit rating agencies were a matter of concern to this Parliament at the end of its previous term, and I should like to highlight in this regard the responsiveness of both the Commission and Parliament, which has adopted a regulation on credit rating agencies. Today, we are raising this issue once again because of the observations that it has been possible to make about the role of credit rating agencies during the crisis. They can be criticised for not having seen the crisis coming, they can be criticised for the volatility of their ratings and for their untimely decisions in announcing their ratings, especially when they relate to sovereign debt. Nevertheless, I believe that we must examine this issue with a clear head. Firstly, the fact that credit rating agencies rate products that they have submitted to investors is not, in itself, shocking. Investors who invest, who provide funds, are entitled to try to discover the risks or the difficulties that may arise, just as they are entitled to try to discover which ratings are good. Where the situation becomes slightly more ambiguous is when these ratings are used, in banking regulations, to determine the amounts of own funds that banks must have in exchange for some of their investments. From this point of view, the 2009 regulation does not really provide a solution since the idea was to provide for both the approval and the supervision of credit rating agencies. Therefore, a rating may be legitimate, but is it legitimate to issue ratings as the agencies do? I believe that the texts that you will propose – I would emphasise, Commissioner, that you have just submitted the text on the introduction of European supervision of credit rating agencies within the framework of the new financial regulation – must enable a solution to be found to these issues, especially that of competition in the field of credit rating agencies. From my perspective, I do not think that simply confirming the creation of a European agency, even if it is public, solves the problems. If the idea is to have an agency that issues ratings in a kinder, more generous fashion than the others, it will not be of much use. More questions need to be asked, in my opinion, about the conditions in which the agencies issue their ratings. There are ratings of private enterprises, and there are ratings of sovereign debt. I shall emphasise the ratings of sovereign debt. The authority which, at Parliament’s request, will be responsible for monitoring and supervising those agencies that will operate in Europe is ESMA, the new financial services authority. I also think that the powers conferred on ESMA should include the possibility not only to supervise the agencies effectively, but also, as regards sovereign debt, to provide for a facility by which to monitor, though not censure, the way in which credit rating agencies issue sovereign debt ratings. We cannot allow a situation – and such situations have indeed arisen – in which, 15 minutes before the markets close, an agency downgrades a country, thus giving rise to completely undesirable consequences. In fact, what needs to be done is to implement a preventive system that will force credit rating agencies to inform the supervisor, within a very short timescale, if need be, of the conditions in which they envisage issuing ratings so that the supervisor can verify both that the standard procedures have been followed and, above all, that the conditions in which the ratings are issued will not adversely affect the situation as regards, in particular, sovereign debt. The debt of businesses is not the same as that of states; it deserves to be treated differently. That being said, some people have mentioned the Court of Auditors, but such courts do not exist in every European country, and they are not all independent. That, Mr President, Commissioner, is the thrust of our questions. How can we improve the operating methods of credit rating agencies and, above all, the dissemination of information, and how can we improve competition? Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial situation in Europe fully justifies the drastic measures which have been taken, in particular, to stabilise the euro area and to avoid the undermining of our single currency. The urgency of the situation justifies the practical approach adopted. However, when it comes to implementing the adopted measures, it should be ensured that Parliament is involved, within the scope of its powers, and can exert its democratic control in appropriate conditions. Indeed, we must ensure that our fellow citizens do not lose confidence, and can regain confidence, in the political institutions. Without such confidence, no structural reform or acceptance of the necessary austerity measures will be possible. Faced with the financial crisis, Europe has not been inactive. We do not say this often enough. In 2009, we drew up and adopted regulations on the credit rating agencies, the implementing provisions of which will be published very shortly by the Commission. Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted a few days ago for the package on the supervision of financial activities. Last Monday, the same committee adopted the report on regulation of hedge fund managers by a large majority. Trialogues have been initiated to seek an agreement with the Council. This agreement must be obtained rapidly, so that our institutions retain their credibility. Our fellow citizens often ask us: ‘What is Europe doing?’ We must meet their expectations. In this regard, I should like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on your determination, and to encourage you to continue with the work programme which you have set out, in accordance with the undertakings made at your hearing. Your ambitious but essential timetable has our support. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with you so that the necessary regulation of financial services takes place. This is not a question of bullying the finance sector, but of establishing the rules to ensure that an activity which should be regulated is regulated, and of making transactions more secure and transparent. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis we are experiencing has forced public authorities to intervene financially using public money. Under these circumstances, it is tempting to consider the implementation of a tax on financial transactions. The income from this tax would be used, for example, to finance the recovery and to develop a sustainable economy, and could initially serve to offset the cost of the crisis borne by the real economy and the taxpayer. This tax would be added to the regulations governing the financial sector, the elimination of tax havens or even the regulations currently being drawn up for derivative products. At this stage, it would be advisable to evaluate the effects of a tax on financial transactions. That is the main purpose of this oral question: to encourage the Commission to examine in practical terms the various points listed in the draft resolution in order to give an opinion on the feasibility and timeliness of such a tax. Commissioner, what you have just said is a step in the right direction. It should, however, be stressed – as you have done – that this measure will have to be approached in a realistic and pragmatic way. Such a tax must not be harmful to the European economy or to the competitiveness of the European financial industry. More generally, it is important to underline the consequences of implementing this tax in the European Union alone, as some people are advocating, if no agreement were possible at international level. We believe that this sort of purely European solution cannot be countenanced. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I do not doubt your determination, and you have, in the points that you have just covered, already answered most of the questions we were going to ask and that are raised by this resolution. I will simply remind you that the difficulty of the subject stems from the fact that the single euro payments area (SEPA) is an initiative of payment institutions, particularly banks. Also, may I say that the purpose of the directive on payment services, for which I had the honour of being rapporteur, was specifically designed to enable us to identify and define the legal instruments needed in order to put this European payments system in place. Another purpose of the directive was to improve competition in the area of payments, and Title II made provision for the creation of payment institutions, which were intended to break the monopoly of the banks. This complicated beginning certainly explains part of the delay, but it is certainly also true, as you have said, that payment services establishments – that is, banks – have demonstrated a certain reluctance to implement this mechanism. There is an explanation: the cost. I am sure you already know this, but to give you an idea: in France, for example, the cost of implementing SEPA is higher than that of changing to the euro. There has also been the matter of interchange fees, which deserves to be tackled. There are two issues involved. The first, as you mentioned, is that of conformity to the rules of competition, but the second issue, which must not be neglected, is that the payment service is a commercial activity for payment institutions which must, therefore, be fairly remunerated. What has been condemned is the possibility of setting interbank margins unilaterally, arbitrarily and without consultation, when these rightly appear excessive. Commissioner, we are counting on you to ensure that the progress we have made with the creation of a single-payments market can result in the swift implementation of European tools for transfers and direct debits. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).  
– (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with many of the arguments put forward by Mrs Thyssen, Mr Karas and Mrs Castex. Nevertheless, I ask myself the following question: following the compromise that we have managed to reach, allowing national options to survive, must we block this directive which constitutes a positive sign of simplification for micro-entities? If I may, Commissioner, I would like to make a non-committal proposal. First of all, I would suggest that Parliament must support Mr Lehne’s proposal and that you take into account what has just been said about modifying other directives. In that way, we will very quickly reach agreement: accounting rules for small businesses, and a European system in that area. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, President, Commissioner, like Mrs Wortmann-Kool before me, I am, of course, going to tell you that we approve of the positions adopted by the Commission to deal with the current situation in Greece. As regards the Spanish Presidency, we are pleased to note the objective that you are setting yourself to improve the coordination of economic policies. This strong political will must also be applied in order to see through two current and important projects: the structuring of a genuine form of financial supervision and the regulation of hedge funds. True, Europe must not be a fortress, but nor must it be a sieve. In both these areas, the Presidency really must have room to manoeuvre so that it can negotiate productively with Parliament. We expect the Council, at its next meeting, to send out a strong signal to the public and to the market: to the public to restore confidence in the euro, and to the market to show its solidarity with Greece. The Council must give a strong indication that it will not let itself be overawed by the attempts to destabilise the euro made by certain speculators who have no hesitation in speculating against those Member States that are currently facing economic and social difficulties. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the commissioner’s comments just now genuinely answer the question that was asked. The European Union does not make funds available without conditions. Those conditions have been mentioned: quality of public spending, sustainable development objectives, employment policy, climate change, but also, of course, the need to make up for the shortfalls of the previous administration as quickly as possible, so that these countries that we are helping can reach the level required. However, in a crisis such as the one we are going through, I believe that we must not go overboard with conditions. We must trust the governments of the Member States that receive European aid to implement the necessary provisions and avoid, as the commissioner said, provisions that could be retrograde or backward-looking. Social spending is, of course, important – it must be preserved – but here, too, we must trust the Member States to adopt the measures needed to rectify the situation and not carry out nit-picking checks, which would be ineffective anyway. The time to assess the way in which the Member States have used European aid will be when any new aid is granted, and it is then that we will perhaps be able to draw conclusions from measures that were unsuitable, particularly in the social sphere. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome your determination. Europe has begun to put in place effective regulation, but Europe must not find itself isolated. Close international cooperation is necessary, and this is exactly what we expect of the G20. It must pursue the reforms, which were initiated at previous meetings, with rigour and vigour. The international framework for regulating the financial sector must be completed, so that it can aid investment, growth and employment. Guiding principles must be affirmed. The crisis is not over. We must not return to the situation ex ante and abandon measures needed to avoid, as far as possible, the renewal of crises which are particularly damaging to the real economy, growth and employment. The strengthening of supervision and regulation is equally necessary. The obligations for supervision should reflect the level of systematic risk that the financial institutions impose on this sector. Speculative activities, which represent a significant risk, should be discouraged by increasing the capital requirements and applying the Basel rules internationally. As for salaries in the financial sector, we should recommend pay committees, increase transparency of these salaries with stricter disclosure requirements and supervise variable salaries, notably bonuses. The strengthening of global financial institutions is likewise an imperative, as is the reform of governance and representation at the IMF. Commissioner, these are some of the expectations citizens have of the next G20, where Europe must speak with one voice, with determination and conviction. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

) Madam President, President of the Court of Auditors, I would like to start by thanking you and all of the members of the Court – including Ms Kaljulaid, who is here with you – for the work you do and in particular for the attention you pay to Members of the European Parliament. You pay us a great deal of attention and I really wanted to thank you for that. I would also like to thank Commissioner Šemeta, who, following on from the remarkable work of his predecessor, continues to improve the auditing of our accounts and the quality of special reports. I would like to apologise on behalf of my colleague, Bogusław Sonik, who has been detained by other parliamentary commitments. I too regret the absence of the Council, which is the budgetary authority. Mr President, this report comes too late. That is not your fault. I tabled amendments to the Financial Regulation to change the timetable. The European Commission must present the accounts before 31 March each year, the Court must publish its report before 30 June, and Parliament must vote before 31 December. It is inconceivable that today, in November, we should still be talking about matters concerning 2011. I suggest that the working group that I have proposed should meet to change this timetable. I would like to make a few observations: Article 323 of the Treaty suggests that Parliament should ensure that the necessary financial means are made available to the European Union. I wonder if the Court could not play a role in raising the alarm about the Union’s cash position: we have learned that we had a shortfall of EUR 9 billion and we are incapable of paying our bills. I would therefore suggest that the Court can help us to monitor the functioning of the Union. A final word about shared management: I think that we need to take another look at it here. I wonder about the independence of the audit authorities and about relations with our national audit institutions, and I think that the shared management system – which has proved useful in its time – should be re-examined. I wonder if we should not create our own finance function at Union level and get rid of this system of shared management, which contains a lot of errors, is very expensive and the efficiency of which merits re-examination.

 Firstly, I regret that the President of the European Council did not attend the debate. The crisis has caught up with the debate on the European budget. We argue: that is normal. However, we need an agreement; otherwise, we will be the laughing stock of the international community. Yes, we must support the European Commission’s excellent proposals. At the same, however, we cannot ignore the financial difficulties that many Member States are experiencing. In this context, I have a suggestion to make: we should maintain the overall multiannual ceiling proposed by the Commission and establish two separate periods. The first would last three years and we would agree to freeze appropriations to give the Member States time to put their finances in order and ratify the Treaty on Stability. During the second period, from 2017 to 2020, we would increase the budget slightly to reach the amount proposed by the Commission, and this would be financed, in particular, by the own resources established in the meantime. In 2014 we will have a new European Parliament, a new Commission and a new President of the European Council. In 2015 the United Kingdom might leave the Union. We could have a political debate on all of these matters when we come to the 2014 European elections. Jean-Pierre Audy,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control
. − (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, my first words will be to give apologies on behalf of Ms Ivanova, detained by other Parliamentary activities, who has entrusted me with summarising for you the report of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Our committee recognises that financial instruments are useful in creating multiplier effects and leverage effects, such as guarantees and tolls. However, we draw your attention to the recommendations of the Court of Auditors and its 2010 opinion on ownership of instruments, risk-taking, accounting, transparency and reinforcement of EU staff capacity to operate them. The second point concerns links with financial markets. We think that these instruments should only be used when there is no offer from the private sector, so as to avoid any distortion in financial markets. Lastly, speaking personally, I am sorry that the idea of introducing an obligatory user contribution was not explored, in particular for trans-European transport networks that need financing, particularly those are not immediately profitable.

Mr President, I want to say something about the interpretation of Rule 191 of the Rules of Procedure. As there has been no announcement, I gather that there has been no opposition to that interpretation. For the sake of democracy in our Parliament, I wanted to be sure that it had no retroactive effect, that it did not affect the current mandates and political agreements within the committees, and that this rule would apply to the renewal of future mandates in the parliamentary committees concerned.

Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we must reach an agreement if we do not want to be the laughing stock of the international community over what, unfortunately, remains a small budget. That agreement is difficult to reach, however. I would like to emphasise the need to establish a review clause for 2017. By 2017 the Member States will have had time to ratify the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance. The issue of public finances will be resolved, as will the issue of sovereign debt. In 2017 we will have a new Parliament, a new Commission and a new President of the European Council. Consequently, if we do not reach an agreement, let us open a political debate on all of the issues. In this regard, I would like to emphasise this review clause, which, in the context of this political debate, will allow us to set out perspectives that correspond to the European ambitions to which we all aspire. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I want to make a point of procedure to the members of the Conference of Presidents under your authority, Mr President. I regret that we did not have a political debate to prepare for this European Council with the General Affairs Council. I would suggest, and I hope you agree, President-in-Office of the Council, that you should come and prepare for the European Councils with us so that you can hear the political debates in this House. I was disappointed in this European Council: very little was said about growth; practically nothing on competitiveness; no proposals on a major infrastructure investment plan. Indeed, all we heard about it in the press was that agreement had been reached on the timetable for the banking union. When it comes to the proposals concerning the contractual relations between the Member States and the European Union, like some other speakers, I have a hard time believing them. Take the national reform programmes: France, under Mr Fillon’s Government, put forward proposals that were accepted at the June European Council, with the new President of the Republic. Where are the recommendations for each Member State? France had proposed reducing public spending, and reforming pensions and the labour market. I think that we need to monitor these country-specific recommendations. However, we can tighten contractual relations through convergence on social aspects; Article 155 of the Treaty provides for this. We must ensure convergence of minimum wages. The former communist countries have been members of the European Union for eight years. We must factor convergence of minimum wages into the price chain. As you said, President-in-Office of the Council, we need to restore confidence. We need to use politics to restore the confidence of the people. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, I should like to speak about those paragraphs which refer to Parliament’s organisation and its seat. Paragraph 86 [sic
: 87] states that Parliament believes that, like every directly elected parliament, the European Parliament should have the right to decide on its own seat. This statement is an error, Mr President, and I should like to request that, in accordance with the appropriate procedures, this error should be removed. Admittedly, the German Parliament, the Bundestag, decided, on its own account, to transfer its seat from Bonn to Berlin, but constitutional and political practices differ widely from one Member State to another. In the Member State to which I belong, the seats of the National Assembly and the Senate are determined by statute. Then there are the paragraphs which call for studies regarding the savings to be made. From the carbon-footprint point of view, a seat in Strasbourg is exactly the same as a seat in Brussels. As for savings, I believe that it is necessary to include a study of all EU seats: the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, the European Medicines Agency in London, the European Banking Authority in London, the European Patent Office in Munich, etc. If we are going to carry out a study, let us do it covering all the seats of the European Union rather than, as it were, deliberately singling out the European Parliament.

Mr President, I would like to express my regret at the absence of the Heads of State or Government. That is nothing against you, Minister for European Affairs, but there is no Head of State here, not even their representative, President Van Rompuy. Where is Baroness Ashton, attending the European Council meeting? Yes, we need a federation of nation States in the long term, Mr Barroso, and we support you on this matter. However, we must not forget a Europe of results. Above all else, we need a Europe of results. We need to keep an eye on our banks, our major infrastructure, on budget cuts, diplomacy and defence. I should like to draw your attention to social convergence. Look at the former communist countries. It is not eight days that they have been members of the European Union, but eight years. The minimum wage is EUR 200. We should be ashamed. We have the necessary legal bases – Articles 154 and 155 of the Treaty – and therefore wage increases should be achievable through social negotiation. Yes, we need to move towards a federation of nation states. However, we need less haste and more speed. If we were to hold 27 referendums, 25 or 26 of them would say ‘no’. Do not rush us; we will not move towards a political Europe without democracy. And we must consider the suffering of the people. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for all the competence, patience and vision that you have employed in performing your duties. I should like to make some observations on your proposals. Firstly, I am surprised that the Council is not here, because it is the Council which really should have presented this proposal to us. It is in charge of this matter and not the Commission. It is up to the Council to make this proposal for a specific mission of the Central Bank relating to prudential supervision. I agree with some of my fellow Members: this legal basis does indeed have the merit of being efficient, but I do not think it meets our fellow citizens’ expectations, as they wanted regulation at European level. Furthermore, I am puzzled about Article 15 of the proposal, which lays down sanctions, while the legal basis, namely Article 127(6), only provides for prudential supervision. We are told that managers will be removed or fines imposed of up to 10% of turnover. I believe that we should have this point checked. I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, for approximately the last four years, the Committee on Budgetary Control has, under this legal basis, been calling for regulatory supervision of the European Investment Bank, and it would be worthwhile for this regulation to extend to cover public banks, and particularly public development banks. Finally, I believe that, under Article 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, we could consider introducing a European policy on regulators, for, under this Article, the Union is entitled to adopt any measure it needs to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market – regulators for credit institutions, and also for insurance, which is not provided for under Article 127(6), and for energy and digital technology. In short, we must introduce a genuine regulatory policy for our European markets if we wish to achieve a genuine internal market. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Commissioner, finally, we have a European Council on growth. I am sorry that in December 2011, when the Heads of State or Government agreed on the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, the President of the European Council did not call a specific Council to look at growth, but we have got there in the end. I think that we need to call formally on the 25 states to ratify this Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which sends out a message of confidence and solidarity, in terms of both the markets and the people. I appeal to the political powers in France to honour the signature of the French Republic without delay. We have talked about growth, but I think that we also need to talk about competitiveness. We need to talk about the competitiveness of our continent: yes, we need a major infrastructure plan. We do not need EUR 10 or 20 billion; we need investments of between EUR 1 000 and 1 500 billion. We lack imagination when it comes to own resources. Why not establish compulsory contributions for digital measures, energy networks, roads, railways and water? I am proposing once again that we carry out an audit of public spending and pool military, diplomatic and research spending. Finally, on an institutional level, I was pleased that our Chair, Mr Daul, reiterated the suggestion that the President of the European Parliament be invited to the European Council. However, Mr President, the President of the European Council himself needs to establish a relationship with our Parliament. Since the establishment of a permanent presidency, we have had no contact with the Heads of State or Government. We need political dialogue at the very highest level with the Heads of State or Government and with Mr Van Rompuy, who is absent from this House far too often. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Madam President, this is a point of order under Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union.

 Mr President, as part of these discussions on Venezuela’s decision to withdraw from an inter-American human rights organisation, I would like to draw Parliament’s attention to the fact that very important trade negotiations are currently under way between two trade blocks, the European Union and Mercosur, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, and that Venezuela is a candidate for accession to Mercosur. That might appear a little irrelevant, but I believe that we, ourselves, cannot work with areas which do not respect a body of rules of law. We are clearly not going to interfere in the procedures for States to become members of Mercosur, in the same way that Mercosur has no right to intervene to decide whether Croatia joins the European Union or not. Nevertheless, in the negotiations between these two blocks, I feel that the European Union and South America should share in a common destiny. It would therefore be a very bad signal if Venezuela did not respect human rights, and that is an issue that this Inter-American Commission is meant to monitor. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

) Mr President, Minister, Commissioners, I will never get used to European Councils being prepared by the General Affairs Council, and I am disappointed that Mr Van Rompuy has not come to debrief us at this meeting, even if it is informal. Actually, Minister, the problem at hand does not come under the authority of the rotating Presidency. Since there has been a permanent Presidency, we at the European Parliament no longer have any contact with Heads of State or Government. We are facing a problem which falls to the European Council and Heads of State or Government. I regret that we have no dealings with Mr Van Rompuy because the truth is that the Council convened tomorrow and one at the end of June is intended to close the European Semester. This is not exactly the European Council on growth that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) asked for as far back as early December last year. A few thoughts on the matter: firstly, we are no longer listening to advocates of zero growth. This is good news. Next, I reiterate the idea that we should examine the effectiveness of public spending. I propose an independent audit, conducted by the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors, to find out where we could make savings: 27 armies, yet no enemies, research programmes that have been funded 15 times without any coordination, hundreds of diplomatic buildings where the costs are not even shared. The second point of thought is competitiveness. A word that is not used enough. Firstly, the competitiveness of our companies (flexicurity, labour costs) – and this does not mean public spending and higher levies as proposed by Mr Hollande to resolve the problems of competitiveness that we face in Europe and France. Next, the competitiveness of the continent. Yes, we need a major infrastructure plan for roads, digital technology, space and universities. Finally, for struggling States, I suggest, in line with Jean-Paul Gauzès’ proposals, that we consider establishing hive-off vehicles, beyond ratios, with a banking licence, in other words, access to the European Central Banks (ECB)’s cash to help States recover. However, each State needs to pay off its debts. We are never going to get a political majority whereby the people of one State pay off another State’s debts. Each State needs to pay off its own debts. Lastly, Mr President, the speech on the State of the Union is woefully inadequate. I propose organising a Congress of the Union in the autumn, which would bring together Heads of State or Government, the European Commission, the European Parliament and national parliaments to ensure that the direction of the continent is in the interests of the European people.

 Mr Hoang Ngoc, you are talking about taxes and collecting taxes. I am talking about public spending. The experts tell us that, in terms of public spending at each of the three levels, in other words, European, national and regional level, which includes local authorities, if we were to take a close look at our public spending, without touching upon the issue of sovereignty, if we were just to look at how we can make improvements to pool our expenditure, we could save billions and billions and billions, which could be used to reduce debts and to make investments. I am not talking about taxes; I am talking about making savings in public spending. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, the Heads of State or Government are meeting in an informal Council. It was customary for the President of the Council to come and report on the Councils, even when they were informal. However, I believe you will take the floor at 19.00 – I also hope that they will let you stay for dinner so that the President of Parliament can stay at the Council – but has the President of the Council been invited?

 On the basis of the report by Portuguese MEP Vital Moreira, I voted for the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the 2009 regulation on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. On 28 July 2011, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) adopted the Appellate Body Report in the case ‘European Communities – Definitive Anti-Dumping Measures on Certain Iron or Steel Fasteners from China’. In the reports, it was found, inter alia
, that Article 9.5 of the Council Regulation of November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community was inconsistent with WTO rules. This legislative proposal aims to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings. I hope that the Commission and the Committee on International Trade have indeed respected the principle of reciprocity. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

I voted in favour of discharge to the Commission on the basis of the report by my excellent colleague, Christofer Fjellner, who has accomplished an immense task in difficult conditions. I do not understand why the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors do not work together enough. With regard to the consolidated accounts, it is not normal to present them with negative equity and not include the EU’s ownership over the Members States in terms of staff pensions, the debt for which is, moreover, provisioned as a liability.

 I did not vote for the proposal to postpone discharge to the Council proposed by the report of my Spanish colleague, Inés Ayala Sender. By mistake, I did not vote for discharge in the Committee on Budgetary Control. As last year, my intention was to do so. I note that the European Court of Auditors did not comment on the management of the Council. I am also disappointed that my proposal for a legal study of the power of the European Parliament to grant discharge to the Council was rejected. That would have identified, in particular, the consequences for discharge of the creation of the European Union as a legal entity by the Treaty of Lisbon. I think these debates between the Council, which thinks that, unlike the other EU institutions, it is not responsible for the use of the funds made available to it, and the statement that granting discharge to the Commission equates to granting discharge for the entire EU budget, including the parts of the budget used by the Council, are derisory. All these debates do not reflect well on the Committee on Budgetary Control. I hope things will quickly become clear. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, my first words will be to congratulate Ms Ticău on the tremendous work she has done in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on this eGovernment dossier. I would like to thank the Commission for its work. I should like to make three comments. First, we need assurance that we have the coverage that will enable us to use all these new technologies across the entire European continent. This is an important factor for the competitiveness of our continent. In the canton of Meymac, in Corrèze, of which I am the elected representative, and also in Limousin and Auvergne, not all of our territory is covered, and this is a real problem. We need to achieve 100% coverage within the European Union and the Member States. Secondly, government must not, under the guise of making life easier, become more complex. We, the citizens, are tired of excessive complexity and bureaucracy. Finally, I would like to make a comment concerning the siting of officials. These new technologies must enable officials to stay where they are and give them the possibility of teleworking with their central administration, thanks precisely to eGovernment.

 Considerable work has been carried out in the area of financial stability – congratulations! However, it is incomprehensible for Spain or Italy to borrow from the banks at 6% while the banks borrow from the European Central Bank at 1%. I propose that we create, within each Member State of the euro area, special purpose defeasance entities, with a banking license to manage bad debt that exceeds the ratios authorised by the Stability and Growth Pact. I propose a political debate between national parliaments and the European Parliament on savings to be made in public expenditure (e.g. armies, diplomatic buildings, research programmes) at three levels – national, European and regional – based on an independent audit which could be conducted by the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors. I reiterate the idea of a major investment plan of EUR 1 000 – 1 500 billion over the EU 2020 period and the creation of an investment section in the European budget. Finally, I regret that President Van Rompuy did not attend this debate, as there is an increasingly urgent need to convene a European Council meeting with only one item on the agenda – growth.

I shall read the text which refers to the deportation of Roma people by France and I would like to point out that it is inaccurate and that, in point of fact, some citizens were evicted from private land at the request of the owners and that, once they were on public land, they were offered the opportunity to return voluntarily to their State of origin.

Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday at 06.46, Strasbourg time, time stopped in Japan. In a joint prayer, the Japanese people turned their thoughts to those killed or injured by the natural disaster together with the serious nuclear incident at the Fukushima power plant. One year earlier, on 11 March at the same time, 06.46, an earthquake of 8.9 on the Richter scale caused the loss of the plant’s electricity supply. The reactors shut down and the emergency generators went into operation. Unfortunately, 55 minutes later, 14-metre high waves devastated the plant: 19 000 dead, 340 000 displaced persons, an earthquake and a tsunami produced the greatest nuclear disaster in the world. Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) I would like to thank you for your initiative and to say that the dignity and courage of the Japanese people, their government and the families affected are in our thoughts. We are thinking of them. This disaster led to a political debate, as you have pointed out, involving all sectors of the public. In the heat of the moment, some states decided either to shut down nuclear power plants immediately or to gradually phase them out. However, worldwide there are more nuclear plants being constructed than the number shut down, and so the issue is a topical one. Moreover, this disaster is just one in the list of increasingly frequent disasters worldwide. Who could forget the earthquake in Haiti or the Deepwater oil disaster? Commissioner, the European Union reacted immediately, and I would like to thank your colleague, Mr Oettinger. After the disaster on 11 March, the European Council met immediately, on 24 and 25 March 2011, and called for a comprehensive evaluation of the safety risks of nuclear power for all the plants in the European Union. The European Commission was asked to review the June 2009 directive on nuclear safety, and the programme was thus set up. Today, all the Member States have carried out their evaluations; we await a peer review and the European Council in June 2012 will make an overall assessment. The PPE Group would like thinking to focus on the following areas for improvement. Firstly, with regard to safety standards, the European Union and its citizens must be assured that we have the best safety standards in the world. We know that these safety standards develop in line with scientific expertise and that they must be continually amended and made binding upon operators in the sector. Secondly, governance must be reviewed so as to give greater independence to the national safety authorities. My third point relates to transparency. In this sector, transparency must be beyond reproach. All national safety authorities must make their documents public to ensure that their citizens are properly informed. Fourthly, we must review development and the technical criteria relating to the selection of sites where nuclear power plants are located. Fifthly, we must jointly improve emergency preparedness and response. I would like to remind Members of the proposal to create a European civil protection force. Sixthly, operators’ civil liability needs to be clarified. We must include all the costs of nuclear power within cost prices, including possible risks and the costs of decommissioning power plants, either through suitable insurance, or through own capital requirements. Seventhly, the full costs should be included – sorry, I just said that, in relation to risks and decommissioning. Eighthly, I would like to mention scientific training and research. On this point, I welcome the Commission’s proposals to extend the Euratom research programme by two years. Worldwide, we will not be able to resolve our problems concerning energy and competitiveness, maintaining our lifestyle while tackling global warming, without addressing all these issues, which are necessary for the operation of nuclear power plants throughout the world and, in particular, for maximum safety.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Šefčovič, I am having trouble getting used to the fact that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, it is the General Affairs Council that prepares the European Council meetings and it is you, Mr President, who wishes to participate in the European Council. I propose that President Van Rompuy be invited to prepare European Council meetings. I would like to discuss three ideas, primarily with regard to making savings, but specifically savings in the sense of avoiding public spending. I propose that we consider pooling the resources of the European Union and the Member States, starting, for example, with an audit by the European Court of Auditors, in partnership with our 27 national courts of auditors, on the savings we could make. Twenty-seven armies, more enemies, research programmes financed 15 times over without coordination and hundreds of diplomatic buildings for which we could guarantee management for 10 years. Finally, for growth, we should return to this idea of a major investment of EUR 1 000 to 1 500 billion in the Europe 2020 strategy. I also think we are not working enough on social convergence, with minimum wages that are not progressing. What hope do our people have if we fail to factor into the price chain a return to social convergence? Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, President of the Commission, let us start by talking about economic and financial subjects; you have stated, Prime Minister, that Denmark did not envisage being involved in the economic integration of the euro area. Could you reassure us of the swift implementation of legislative proposals on derivatives and the two regulations which must accompany the overhaul of the Stability and Growth Pact? We really do need these texts. Majorities – particularly a political majority – are forming on the tax on financial transactions; could you give us your exact political position on this matter? Next, I should like to draw your attention to trade policy. It is the Council that gives the Commission the mandate to negotiate on the Union’s behalf. It is a competence of the Union, and we, the European Parliament, have a new political competence to approve treaties on trade. I should like to draw your attention to the need to avoid being naïve and the need to apply the principle of reciprocity; for example, will proposals on negotiations with Mercosur be exchanged at the end of your Presidency? I would advise you to be very careful. Finally, with regard to growth, when President Van Rompuy came to tell us about the last European Council, I proposed holding a special European Council entirely dedicated to growth. You are a Member of the European Council, with a special position. President Schulz wishes to be invited to the European Council; will you support us on the presence of our President at the European Council and on the need to have a true European Council dedicated entirely to growth? I wanted to talk about social convergence but my speaking time has run out. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution of 14 December 2011 on the impact of the financial crisis on the defence sector in the EU Member States. I am committed to defending the notion that a common research policy can, and must, be an essential component in building an industrial base for defence. In the absence of a common European industrial defence policy, the defence market has become very fragmented in terms of demand, supply, regulations and standards. I am pleased that, at my behest, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, having been asked for its opinion on this report, took the view that a European industrial defence policy would be valuable in reinforcing the European Union’s role on the world stage and maintaining Europe’s technological capacity, while also taking into account the specificities in each Member State. Cross-border and transatlantic industrial cooperation can facilitate access to new technologies, promote advanced product development and encourage the adoption of effective measures to reduce costs. The financial crisis means that it is not viable to build a European defence industry at a national level. I welcome the work done by Mr Danjean, as Chair of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence.

 I voted in favour of the resolution of the European Parliament of 14 December 2011 on the next EU-Russia Summit. I regret the fact that my proposal of January 2011 to invite the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, to speak at a formal sitting of the European Parliament, which was accepted by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), was turned down by the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament. The Russian Federation is an important neighbour. Five Member States of the European Union share a border with it. Between Europe and Russia, there have been centuries of relations marked by remarkable successes, but also immense suffering. Our common history is indisputable. It derives from the evolution of our respective peoples, the rise and fall of empires, the links between the royal families, culture, the arts, writers, religions, especially Christianity, military combat against fascism, positioning in respect of communism, and so on. Today, Russia has been overtaken by the success of China and is rediscovering its Western roots. It is and will be the essential link in the dialogue between the West and the East, which will serve as a basis for political negotiations aimed at establishing future global governance.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, I should like to begin by saying a few words about currencies. The 19th century was dominated by the pound sterling, the 20th century by the dollar; in the 21st century, we have no idea how currencies will be organised. This was one of the issues tabled by the President of the G20. We have a duty to manage our currency. Traditionally, we had one currency per State. We are experimenting with a currency for a region, a supranational currency. The creation of this economic area of 26 States is good news, Presidents and Heads of State or Government. Hungary has changed its mind, and Denmark is uniting with the euro area even though it was not obliged to do so. This is good news! The United Kingdom is a major European country. We know why it has not joined the euro area: because of its financial services industry, as you said, Mr President. It is also because, in reality, it does not want the financial transaction tax, on which a political consensus is in the process of being reached. The second piece of good news concerns financial stability. All of our great democracies, with the exception of Greece, which is a special case – the conclusions say as much – have changed their government, have taken serious measures in relation to financial governance. We are putting plans in place to ensure the financial stability of our continent. This is good news. I do not believe in such a thing as contagion. We have to consolidate the golden rules and reform our Stability and Growth Pact. There are two issues that have not been resolved. The first is growth. Mr President, I believe the time has come to hold a special European Council in order to examine growth conditions and the terms of a major European investment plan. The second issue concerns the huge disappointment of democrats. Contrary to what was written in Ms Merkel and President Sarkozy’s letter, there has been no mention whatsoever of a parliamentary dimension. The Heads of State or Governments’ failure to add a parliamentary dimension to economic governance is plain wrong! I suggest you do something about it.

 Mr President, I share your point of view. I did not understand the question, but I think that we are in agreement, Mr Koumoutsakos. I think that the issue to be dealt with concerns the broad guidelines on growth set by the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States. That is why I would reiterate my proposal: a future European Council should set broad guidelines on growth. In truth, we know what the two broad guidelines are. The first, as the Commission President mentioned, is a major plan for investing in infrastructure via project bonds. The second is an internal market that can be more than 27 national markets, with flexicurity, and in which we will find the one or two growth points that we need, both to pay off our debts and to finance social progress with the economic prosperity we will create.

 Mr President, we are in the process of holding consultations on the nominations of the Members of the Court of Auditors. I would remind you that the Court of Auditors of the European Union is composed of 27 Members. Under Article 286 of the Treaty, the Members shall be appointed by the Council after it has consulted Parliament. Today, we are holding a consultation, which will be referred to the Council. Therefore, the governments are the ones that propose candidates, and the European Parliament provides an opinion. There is a total of eight candidates, proposed by eight States: Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Sweden. Four of those States – Belgium, Italy, Denmark and Spain – have recently seen a change of government. Two States – Denmark and Spain – with elections, and two – Belgium and Italy – without. In one of those four States, the Kingdom of Spain, the political forces have changed – I was at the summit of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in Marseille – whereas the other three States have made no demands. On the subject of Spain, the Spanish political forces have asked me to request that Parliament postpone the vote – as is possible under Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure – in order to give them time to assess the situation. The King of Spain is due to appoint the government next week. The request being put to our Parliament is to postpone the vote, and it has come from the PPE Group, Mr President. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Like the generations before us, we know that we will overcome the challenges we face by drawing on mankind’s scientific expertise. This is the case where energy is concerned.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to congratulate the rapporteur, my friend Jean Březina, on his excellent work. The European Council meeting of 4 February 2011, known as the EU ‘Energy’ Council, adopted an ambitious European energy policy, intended to assure the people of Europe that they would have safe, sustainable energy at the best price, whose supply would be guaranteed and which would contribute to Europe’s competitiveness. This policy, born out of the Europe 2020 strategy, provides for investment in the development of low-carbon technologies. Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are included in these energy technologies that we Europeans must maintain, develop and implement. We must do so all the more since we are the undisputed and world-recognised leaders in this field thanks to our businesses, our universities, our engineers, our specialist workers and our research centres. I should like Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, to congratulate the European Commission, for having quickly tabled this proposal on 7 March 2011, before the tragedy at Fukushima. I should like to support this proposal for five reasons. First, it aligns the schedules for research programmes with the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013. Second, it stresses safety, which is an essential component of the confidence that the operators of this form of energy have a duty to provide to our fellow citizens. We are pleased that the Union can continue to invest in the area of safety, which is evolving with advances in science and the expectations of our fellow citizens. Third, this proposal allows us to maintain our status as world leaders in the nuclear sciences. Fourth, we are supporting our universities, our research centres and, notably, I want to emphasise this, the European Joint Research Centre, all of which are doing a remarkable job. Finally, it allows us to resolve a part of the cost of the ITER project, which is going to demonstrate the industrial feasibility of producing electricity by nuclear fusion. This will allow us to honour our international commitments to our partners in the ITER project – China, the United States, Russia, Japan and South Korea. Well done, Commissioner, you have our support and thanks. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, my first words will be to echo the compliments made to the Court of Auditors, to President Caldeira, and to Commissioner Šemeta. I am disappointed that the Council is not here, since it is the second budgetary branch, and I join my colleagues in saying that within the shared management, this is where we have the highest error rate, and the Council is not here to discuss this. Need I remind you that we refused to grant discharge to the Council? The least we could expect is that this institution be here today. I would like to say a few words on the DAS, which is the statement of assurance. This is an obligation under the Treaty. I would like to know, Mr President, Commissioner, whether we have a positive or negative DAS. I should also like to congratulate Ms Kaljulaid for her work in presenting the DAS opinion. Regarding the annual accounts, we have an unqualified certification opinion. I must say that I cannot get used to the fact that we are not entering in the accounts the EUR 30 billion that Member States owe us in respect of pensions, in application of accounting standards in the public sector. On the underlying transactions, we have two opinions and one observation. I therefore believe that we need to make progress so that we in Parliament know what is the general opinion on the accounts and underlying transactions. Finally, I think that the number of tests is far from enough: Two-hundred and thirty-eight in agriculture, 90 in outside access. I believe we need to analyse whether this number of tests is sufficient and once again, I would like to reiterate the proposal whereby the European Court of Auditors relies on national courts of auditors for its opinion on shared management, as authorised by the Treaty.

 Mr President, President of the European Commission, President of the European Council, I would like to welcome you as you are a great European democrat and European democracy finds its expression in this House. This House is your home. I would like to make two or three comments. Firstly, we are not in a crisis of the euro. The euro is not the problem. The euro is the solution. We are not in a crisis of Europe. Europe is not the problem, it is the solution. The problem is the indebtedness of Member States. You have protected the financial stability of the Member States at the level of the euro area and the European Union, and I thank you for that. We should ask ourselves the following question: what would have happened had we not had the euro? The franc, the escudo, the peseta would all have been devalued by between 10 and 35%, the Greek drachma by 40%, and the Deutschmark would have been re-valued by 20%. Let us reflect on this question and recognise that we are extremely lucky to have the euro, which is a solid currency, with vast foreign exchange reserves, which are respected on a global scale. The truth is that we are making progress towards greater European Union and, as the European Council of 23 October stated, towards a growth strategy with the single market. We shall enter the G20 summit with our heads held high. As Jean-Pierre Jouyet has written, too bad indeed if the financial markets end up imposing political Europe in an example of major historical irony. It is very good news that we are making progress towards this political Europe that we all want. Jean-Pierre Audy,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, my first words must be to congratulate our rapporteurs, Ms Gräßle and Mr Rivellini, as well as the rapporteurs for the groups, who have all done important work. The first thing I want to mention is simplification, and I would like to thank both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for having moved towards simplification. Both citizens and central and local government bodies are at the end of their tether. Every time we see an increase in the error rate, it is because the rules are too complicated. I warmly thank you, therefore, for the Cohesion Fund resources, and for the research that has been done, continuing on from Mr Carvalho’s excellent report. I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for having agreed to introduce a measure of consistency, by allowing the use of international accounting standards applicable to the public sector in future. We had to put an end to this inconsistency whereby the EU’s accountants made their own rules. Thank you also for having looked into shortening the timescale for granting discharge. It is only given after 16 months, which is far too long. I will end by mentioning two other subjects. The first is the national declarations: I have a lot of reservations about these. I believe we ought to discuss the matter from both the political and technical points of view, to make sure that these declarations are in keeping with international auditing standards applicable to the public sector. In auditing, we never ask for declarations of assurance from managing authorities. We ask them for representation letters stating that nothing has been concealed, but not letters of assurance. It is not the job of ministers to perform audits. What is more, in the Member States that have agreed to the principle, the error rates are no lower than in other countries. To conclude, I would like to thank the committees for having agreed to the principle of an investment section within the European Union, in order to keep investment operations separate. We will at last be able to have a budget framework for our major investment projects, such as GALILEO or ITER, which are planned over periods that go well beyond the annual framework, or even the financial perspective. Another significant step forward that is within sight in terms of budget presentation is the inclusion of the future project bonds in our accounting system, and the establishment of a major European investment plan to help growth within the Union. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, well done Mr Barroso, you have a balanced and apt view of the seriousness of the situation and of the common solutions that need to be found. I have listened carefully to the criticisms on the methods. Today, in this House, there are notable absentees: our Heads of State or Government. I have the following dream: that we would have a great political debate on the state of the Union, with the European Commission in its entirety – that is the case – representatives of the people, Heads of State or Government with their representatives, and President Van Rompuy. I would like to ask the heads of the political groups: did we invite Mr Van Rompuy? Did we invite the Heads of State or Government, as well as representatives of the national parliaments? There is a European Council on 17 October. It will be a momentous political moment. We must put your proposals on the table, Mr Barroso, we must have a big political debate with President van Rompuy, who could prepare this European Council session, at our mini part-session in Brussels on 13 October.

 A modern and effective infrastructure is of key importance for achieving the Europe 2020 objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as reducing unemployment, through the completion of the internal market. To this end, the Commission has proposed a ‘Connecting Europe Facility’ (CEF) for the next financial framework in order to accelerate infrastructure development in the fields of transport, energy and information and communication technology (ICT) networks, with particular emphasis on strategic cross-border aspects. In addition to equity instruments and grants, the CEF includes a new financial instrument to mobilise more private sector funding, as well as project bonds. However, the initial report by the Committee on Budgets and the subsequent negotiations with the Council focused on a limited number of issues including, for example, defining project bonds and evaluating the facility. Nevertheless, I welcome the proposals made in this report, which encourages projects in the fields of transport, energy and trans-European networks. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 Launched in 2009, the Baltic Sea macro-region brings together a coherent set of territories that want to cooperate in order to find better solutions to the economic and environmental problems facing them. This cooperation has taken the form of a ‘macro-regional strategy’, designed to coordinate the existing extensive sectoral cooperation and based on four pillars – environment, prosperity, accessibility and security – and an action plan setting out 15 priority areas and 80 flagship projects. The entire Mediterranean basin shares the same natural environment, and its shores are connected by the same history and culture. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which cannot be seized without the coordination and overview permitted by the definition of a macro-regional strategy. In terms of developing potential, maritime traffic must be placed at the heart of a transport strategy for the whole area, particularly for goods. The report also underlines the possibility of boosting the southern dimension of the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy, taking on a concrete territorial dimension which would guarantee greater management of migration flows and impact positively on the performance of the economies of the countries concerned.

 For the majority of the European Union’s neighbours, in other words, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, the EU is the main export market and the main source of imports. Therefore, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area is the most important and most effective instrument at our disposal for strengthening our trade links. The gradual dismantling of trade barriers and regulatory convergence in areas that have an impact on trade are rightly included in this Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. Beyond the economic aspect, free trade areas can be a core component of a wider political agreement, leading, in particular, to an association agreement. The rapporteur also stresses that, with the signature of agreements and the creation of the free trade area, the European Union might also provide its assistance and strengthen the role of civil society or even steer reforms, both in the public and private sectors. My vote in favour of the Ransdorf report applauds its social and democratic goals, which are fundamental aspects of our partnerships. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 On 30 September 2011, the Board of Governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) voted in favour of the necessary amendments to the agreement establishing the EBRD to enable it to expand its region of operations to the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. The report by Mr Binev explains that, in response to the political and economic situation in the countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean, the EBRD has developed a phased approach to the start of its activities. This report gives the European Union much more room for manoeuvre in its cooperation with the countries surrounding the Mediterranean. In fact, the EU representatives in the EBRD should encourage the bank to contribute to the transition towards open market economies by promoting social inclusion and energy efficiency, while taking into account the social, poverty, civil and human rights context. My work at European level has exactly the same goal: that of helping and supporting the Mediterranean countries during their democratic transitions following the wave of revolutions associated with the Arab Spring and during their political and economic transitions.

 The European Union is the principal donor of development aid, the principal investor and the second largest trade partner in Latin America. Latin America has not been hit as hard by the financial and economic crisis as the European economies, with a +4.5% growth outlook for 2012. Unfortunately, 180 million people are still living below the poverty threshold in Latin America. It was therefore important to define a new cooperation with Latin America, in particular, by changing the tools to help this cooperation. Indeed, as the rapporteur recommends, the focus should be on the gradual withdrawal of bilateral aid to middle income countries (MICs) in order to reinforce aid to low income countries (LICs). Faced with the humanitarian and health situation of Latin American countries, it is vital that essential services such as education, training, health and hygiene, removed by the European Commission, are reprioritised. Finally, and as a driving force behind the future of this cooperation, regional policies need to be stimulated in order to reset budgetary and fiscal policies. I voted for this report in order to highlight the need to shift the focus of regional cooperation policies onto urgent health and humanitarian matters. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 As the world’s largest importer of energy, it is now time for the European Union to define a European energy policy in order to provide more effective guidelines for energy use, both within and beyond our borders. The report emphasises, in particular, certain key concepts such as better coordination, diversification, energy sustainability/viability and stronger partnerships with supplier countries. Priority is given to important areas such as the major energy networks and infrastructures, strategic dialogues and international partnerships. It is also important to be able to exchange information, with the establishment of a platform for that purpose, and learn about European and third-country projects in the field of energy. I voted for this report in order to support a vital aspect: improving cooperation with third countries on energy and infrastructures. This multilateral cooperation will help to consolidate the partnerships with third countries in several areas; innovation and research into building reliable networks and facilities will ensure that the European Union has a diversified supply.

 Bluefin tuna stocks in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean have fallen dramatically over the years, and urgent action is needed to protect them. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), to which the EU is a contracting party under the common commercial policy, adopted a new recommendation at its annual meeting in 2010. The amendments include reducing the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and strengthening control measures used to implement a recovery plan. I am therefore in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 concerning a multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. The financial returns on fishing are so high that they actively encourage illegal fishing and other illegal activities. The time has come, therefore, to reassess the management measures adopted by ICCAT and to adapt them to current activities. It is also high time that the European Union acted quickly on its own initiative and as a precautionary measure to protect bluefin tuna and to rebuild stocks. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The European Commission has put the proposal for a financial transaction tax (FTT) at the centre of the debate, particularly in response to the serious consequences of the financial crisis. Ms Podimata’s report proposes to make the financial sector bear a share of the costs of the crisis, to dissuade financial establishments from taking excessive risks, to supplement regulatory measures aimed at preventing future crises and, finally, to generate additional revenue to finance the EU’s general budgets through the enrichment of the residence principle and the removal of pension funds or institutions for occupational retirement provision from the list of financial institutions to which the FTT would be applicable. The report puts forward strong arguments in favour of the application of the FTT at EU level. I am therefore in favour of this proposal. However, the report does not address the management of the revenue from the FTT and opts to have it managed by the multiannual financial framework programme. The FTT would make a significant contribution to the EU’s own resources, thereby broadening the framework for financing specific policies, projects and public goods. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 It was in 1985 that the European Union and China signed the first bilateral cooperation agreement. However, after almost 30 years of partnership, there is still a significant imbalance in trade relations between the EU and China. The list of these disharmonies shows worrying signs: access to Chinese public procurement is limited for foreign enterprises, protection of intellectual property is weak, there are systematic restrictions on the exportation of Chinese rare earths to European industries and, finally, the undervaluation and non-convertibility of the yuan pose a serious problem. Reciprocity, the cornerstone of the agreement, seems no longer, or insufficiently, present in trade relations. European enterprises are currently unable to invest in China under conditions similar to those governing Chinese investors in Europe. My vote in favour of the report by Ms de Sarnez lends support to the proposals made to rebalance EU-Chinese relations. It is also important to provide compliant protection tools and measures to update the terms of this agreement between the EU and China. Finally, we need to address the lack of transparency and reciprocal competition, which sours Sino-European relations today. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The Arab Spring represents an unprecedented revolution in the Mediterranean world. These revolutions have redefined the relationships between the Southern Mediterranean and the European Union, and have built a new trading partnership, founded on fundamental values such as human rights and democracy. This partnership must therefore be consolidated through the establishment of a free trade area, regional integration and a trade strategy. We have a unique opportunity to cooperate in the fields of employment and growth, to step up regional integration and the presence of the European Union through its trade, investment and financing activities. The report reaffirms trade as a solid pillar in the European Neighbourhood Policy, and as a means of involving SMEs by making them an additional tool for economic democratisation. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 There is no doubt that this draft resolution on maritime piracy strengthens the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP). Indeed, maritime transport has been a key vehicle for European economic growth, and not just growth in Europe, as more than three quarters of world trade is carried by sea. The European Union therefore has a genuine interest in ensuring that security is a factor in the common maritime policy. Over recent years, we have seen in the news a resurgence of criminal acts at sea. We find the greatest number of acts of maritime piracy in targeted areas, often concentrated in the Red Sea, and through which large numbers of European and international transport and trading vessels pass. Most of these acts remain unpunished. That is why this motion for a resolution is essential because it calls again for immediate and effective measures against impunity of this nature and calls for the need for strategic coordination between the European Union and third countries.

 Water is a resource for humankind and access to water is fundamental. Due to climate change, there are fears of a decline in the quantity and quality of water available, particularly drinking water, as well as a rise in the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. It is therefore necessary to rationalise water use and the European Parliament’s motion for a resolution calls for more efficient water usage especially in the sectors where most water is used, such as the agriculture sector. Also, the resolution underlines the need to make concrete commitments towards the promotion and protection of water resources, especially in light of the upcoming Rio+20 conference. That is why I voted for this resolution during the very week when the World Water Forum was taking place in Marseille. Jean Roatta  (PPE

The report underlines the importance of taking concrete steps to achieve gender parity in elected offices in the national parliaments and in the European Parliament. We should aim to achieve parity in electoral lists. The report also proposes measures designed to ensure parity within the European Commission, the EEAS and other political and administrative bodies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the signature of the agreement between the European Union and Morocco concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures on agricultural products and fishery products has an economic dimension and, above all, a political dimension. The agreement with Morocco represents support for the rural development policy, support for local farmers as well as support for the democratic process that was initiated several months ago after the parliamentary election. This agricultural agreement is therefore a major component of the advanced status granted to the Kingdom of Morocco in 2008. It also shows that the EU supports and encourages the programme of constitutional and democratic reforms in Morocco. Over and above the economic dimension, this agreement will formally enshrine the rapprochement between the European Union and Morocco. The credibility of the European Union is at stake. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot maintain bilateral relations that merely limp along. That is why I would encourage you to vote in favour of the signature of this agreement. It is a balanced, coherent agreement, which we need so that we can open as soon as possible the negotiations on a free trade agreement. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The European Union is the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid. In 2010, the European Union’s contribution totalled EUR 2.957 billion, and 36% of that aid came from the Commission. The Commission manages its humanitarian activities from its headquarters in Brussels and with the help of a network of local offices all around the world. The average annual budget managed by DG ECHO for its humanitarian aid activities between 2006 and 2010 was EUR 889 million. The report focuses on the following key issues: efficiency and effectiveness of the ECHO control, monitoring and supervision system, especially when framework partnership agreement (FPA) partners or international organisation partners (such as the United Nations) are involved. The report also underlines the need to ensure the sustainability, coherence and complementarity of humanitarian actions, which are key objectives of the EU’s development policy. I therefore voted in favour of this report. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The Committee on Development, on which I sit, worked with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, which was responsible for this report on women’s situation in war. This report deals with the responsibility of women in peace negotiations as well as the impact of armed conflict across the globe on women. The report recommends the creation of a post of Special EU Representative on Women within the European External Action Service (EEAS) and calls on the Member States to put in place action plans to improve the situation of women in conflict countries. As I agree fully with the actions to be taken to improve the situation of women, I voted in favour of this report. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The objective of ‘universal access to energy by 2030’ was launched in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In developing countries, households generally spend a high percentage of their budget on the purchase of low-quality fuels for heating and cooking compared with households with access to electricity and to liquid and gas fuels. In developing countries, sustainable energy access for the poor faces a number of barriers, notably: the inability of the poor to pay for the services, investment costs, connection costs and no national capacity to produce the energy generation equipment and spare parts required. The report stresses that, whilst none of the MDGs are specifically related to energy, access to modern, sustainable energy services for all is a prerequisite for achieving the MDGs. We now need to bring energy to the fore in the debate on the eradication of poverty, by establishing a specific programme focusing on ‘energy and development’ within the framework of the European Union’s development cooperation policy. It is for these priorities that I voted in favour of this report. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

 As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development on Mr Gallagher’s report, I thought it was important to point out that when the European Commission wants to impose sanctions on a country for unsustainable fishing practices, it should take into account that country’s level of development. This is because, according to the principle of policy coherence with development goals, it is crucial, in my opinion, that the measures adopted for fisheries do not undermine the development plans and strategies implemented by the European Union in these countries. Mr Gallagher’s draft report takes up this important idea for our Committee on Development specifying that the measures should not be unjustified, or even discriminatory. I therefore call on the European Commission, when it adopts such measures, to respect this principle of policy coherence with development objectives and to duly consider the level of development and the vulnerability of countries.

 In an effort to promote and to allow access to energy in developing countries insofar as this access contributes to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), I feel that it is important for the European Parliament to respond to the United Nations General Assembly’s declaration of 2012 as the ‘International Year of Sustainable Energy for All’. However, Norbert Neuser’s politically biased report refuses developing countries the right to be free to choose their energy policy by calling on ‘the Commission and the Member States neither to fund nor to otherwise encourage the use of nuclear power in developing countries’. I therefore voted against this paragraph which imposes choices on developing countries by limiting the energy sources to which they can have access. Nuclear power is a clean energy source that could give millions of citizens in developing countries access to basic services such as mains electricity. Maurice Ponga,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, we will give our verdict for the third time on the new development cooperation instrument (DCI) providing for Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM) for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) banana-producing countries following the reduction in tariff preferences. This aid programme has a budget of EUR 190 million and is intended to support 10 ACP countries until 2013. It is crucially important for our African and Caribbean partners, since the banana sector is of considerable economic and social importance in these countries. I bitterly regret the fact that not all of Parliament’s demands concerning the use of delegated acts have been accepted for this instrument. We have nevertheless managed to make progress. Indeed, the text outlines clear objectives and specific criteria for the allocation of resources to the Commission. The Commission has also made a statement specifying how these criteria will be applied. Moreover, we have a statement from the Council regarding the next Multiannual Financial Framework, specifying that the latter will take due account of delegated acts in external aid instruments post-2013. Finally, Parliament states in its resolution – and this is a crucial point in my view – that the outcome of this conciliation does not set any kind of precedent. I have just come back from Togo, where the 22nd session of the ACP-European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly was being held, and I believe I can say that our ACP partners are counting on us, given the urgency of the situation. The funds ought to have been released two years ago. We must be aware of the terrible consequences for our ACP partners should the DCI/BAM Regulation be rejected. The situation of some farmers is catastrophic. We cannot wait any longer and must act accordingly. I am therefore counting on you to endorse this text. Maurice Ponga,

 Mr President, I wanted to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Ms Lövin, on her excellent work. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development, I am pleased that the Committee on Fisheries has taken up the points contained in our opinion, because it is vital for the development dimension to be taken into account in the measures to combat illegal fishing at the global level, for the sake of policy coherence and the close links with development policy. Indeed, combating illegal fishing requires global solutions and the involvement of all countries, including developing ones. However, countries’ technical and financial capabilities also need to be taken into account in the actions to be undertaken. The same constraints cannot be imposed on developed and developing countries without support measures. Small island states have very limited capabilities, for example. Therefore, they must be supported in their efforts to combat illegal fishing. That is why the Union will have to increase the budget for the fisheries sector when it signs agreements in this area in developing countries. Furthermore, it is vital to ensure that the measures to combat illegal fishing are actually applied, because this practice harms the development of countries insofar as it reduces the financial resources they could earn from fishing as an economic activity. The fact is, developing countries need those resources to implement social, economic and education policies. Lastly, it is important for the European Union, when implementing these measures to combat illegal fishing in developing countries, to encourage the involvement of civil society and businesses alongside the countries receiving aid. A holistic approach needs to be taken to halt the scourge of illegal fishing. Maurice Ponga  (PPE
).

 Madam President, I wanted to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Kaczmarek, on his excellent work. It is important that every year, the European Parliament take stock of the work of the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), insofar as this assembly plays a determining role in enhancing the North-South dialogue and in implementing a development policy that is founded on partnership and exchange. 2010 was an eventful year for the JPA, which met twice – as previous speakers have said – in Spain and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to discuss, among other things, the impact of climate change in ACP countries, the impact of the global crisis, freedom and independence of the media, and food security. In 2010, the JPA also sent the first election observation mission of this parliamentary term. I had the honour of co-chairing this mission in Burundi for the presidential elections with Mr Assarid, a Malian MP. This election observation mission was a real success. We were able to meet all the political players involved and thanks to the dual origin of this delegation, both ACP and European, we embodied a different legitimacy from European and African missions. I therefore call on the JPA Bureau to renew this experience, since it will make it possible to put into practice solidarity and the special relations that unite the European Union and ACP countries.

 I am glad that Parliament is stating its views on the current EU-Canada trade negotiations and outlining its priorities in this regard. Canada is undoubtedly a trade partner of the EU, but it is imperative that we in Parliament relay the concerns of our fellow citizens located both on European territory and in regions forming part of the European family, namely, the protection and defence of their interests. By ‘European family’, I mean the overseas countries and territories (OCT), which, although not strictly European territories, maintain a special relationship with the European Union, and, in particular, with the Member States of which they are part. In the trade negotiations currently under way, it is the archipelago of St Pierre and Miquelon, next door to Canada, that is particularly affected. I therefore call on the Commission, during the negotiations, to defend and protect the interests of that overseas country and territory situated in the North Atlantic Ocean. Maurice Ponga,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will today give its verdict for a second time on the amendment to the financing instrument for development cooperation providing for the establishment of Banana Accompanying Measures for the main ACP banana-producing countries. These accompanying measures are justified by the reduction in tariff preferences granted to the ACP countries following the conclusion, in December 2009, of the Geneva Agreement with the United States and the countries of Latin America. The European Union made a commitment at that time to provide EUR 190 million in support to the ACP countries to help them cope with this new competition. We amended both the form and the content of the Commission proposal at first reading. The Council disagreed with us on the form, which is why the regulation has been submitted for a second reading today. Indeed, the Council refused to allow the delegated acts procedure to be applied to strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes, and hence refused to implement the advances of the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament decided to react quickly, and that is crucial. We are therefore sending a strong political message to the ACP countries. The European Parliament is behind them and is doing everything in its power to ensure that the EUR 190 million are released as quickly as possible. Yet we are also sending a message to the Council. The European Parliament is defending its prerogatives as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. The ball is now in the Council’s court. The European Union made a commitment to the ACP countries. The Council should therefore shoulder its responsibilities, as Parliament has done. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question (Rule 149(8)) Maurice Ponga  (PPE

All I would say is that there are international agreements in place that require the European Union to invest in its relations with the ACP countries, and this is one of the agreements that the European Union must prioritise.

 I welcome the European Parliament’s decision to approve the interim agreement between the European Union and the Pacific States. This agreement reflects the commitment of the European Union to this region of the world and sends a strong political signal to the States in the region. I am pleased about that. The political resolution that accompanies this decision to approve the agreement provides an opportunity to point out our demands. We want to establish a balanced and fair relationship with the Pacific States; one which allows for the development of these island States while protecting the interests of our own citizens. While the interim agreement includes specific provisions on the rules of origin for fishery products, it was important to manage this derogation. Indeed, in order to ensure that this derogation, which should allow for the creation of jobs and wealth, is of genuine benefit to local populations and does not harm the European fishery product processing and canning industries, it was vital to provide for an assessment of its impact as soon as possible and to allow for its suspension, where necessary. Guarantees exist to ensure that the agreement is fair and that measures will be taken, if necessary, to protect our interests. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

While the interim agreement includes specific provisions on the rules of origin for fishery products, it was important to manage this derogation. Indeed, in order to ensure that this derogation, which should allow for the creation of jobs and wealth, is of genuine benefit to local populations and does not harm the European fishery product processing and canning industries, it was vital to provide for an assessment of its impact as soon as possible and to allow for its suspension, where necessary. Guarantees exist to ensure that the agreement is fair and that measures will be taken if necessary to protect our interests. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many years, the European Union has maintained a special and strong relationship with ACP countries. This special relationship has resulted, in particular, in the granting of tariff preferences. Such is the case for the banana sector, in which ACP countries have benefited from a preferential trading arrangement for their exports to the European Union. This preference has been challenged at the WTO, especially by the Latin American countries, which are large exporters of bananas. Therefore, in order to comply with WTO rules and to end a long dispute, the European Union accepted to reduce its tariffs in the banana sector in December 2009. On account of the privileged partnership that it maintains with ACP countries, the European Union nonetheless wanted to help banana-producing ACP countries to cope with this increased competition. Consequently, Europe has pledged EUR 190 million until 2013 to help banana-producing ACP countries to adapt, be competitive and restructure their sector if need be. In the report on which we will vote tomorrow, the European Parliament is reaffirming its commitment to, and support for, banana-producing ACP countries, and I very much welcome that. Thus, we have suggested, among other things, that the European Union could adopt complementary measures after 2013 if necessary. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleague Mrs Morin-Chartier and the other Members have said, on 27 and 28 February the violent storm Xynthia battered several French regions, claiming 53 lives and causing huge material damage. The storm was exceptionally intense; it caused devastating floods along the French coast. After Madeira, Europe has once again been affected. Brittany, the region of my colleague and friend, Mr Cadec, has been severely affected. A state of natural disaster has thus been declared in three French regions: Brittany, Poitou-Charentes and Pays de la Loire. In the face of these disasters, the European Union must demonstrate its responsiveness and express its solidarity. Words and a resolution alone will not enable us to support the victims of these disasters; we must also and above all provide financial aid. I therefore call on the European Commission – and my colleague Mr Béchu supports my request – to swiftly release the EU Solidarity Fund so as to help the disaster areas cope with the damage. This disaster shows that Mr Barnier’s proposal to create a European civil protection force is relevant. Europeans must take action together, since more and more disasters are occurring and they are affecting our European territories and, in particular, our most isolated and vulnerable regions, such as the islands in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean islands.

 I welcome the adoption, today, by a large majority (558 votes to 57), of the report by Mr van Nistelrooij. By adopting this report, Parliament is sending out a strong message to citizens and is responding to the social concerns relayed in particular by Eurocities. The report provides for the possibility of using the ERDF for the renovation and replacement of existing buildings and for new structures designed to help marginalised communities in rural or urban environments in each of the 27 Member States. This extension from the 12 States that joined in 2000 and 2007 to all the Member States offers solutions to the problems that insalubrious housing poses for certain marginalised communities throughout the EU. It will thus be possible to establish an integrated and sustainable approach at EU level. Furthermore, this extension dovetails perfectly with the aim of the 2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. I am pleased that Parliament has voted for these amendments and I hope that the regions concerned will find it a useful tool for solving what is an urgent and fundamental problem for these communities. Michel Barnier  (PPE

Mr President, thanks to the tenacity of the Swedish Presidency, which I too thank, we have the Treaty of Lisbon. However, a treaty such as this is not a project, but a tool, a toolbox to serve the European project, and it is therefore up to the men and women who manage the institutions – the Commission, its president, the Council – and to us here to make good use of these tools in the future, at the end of a transition period that has been long, too long. For we are now better equipped to take up three major challenges in the face of which, ladies and gentlemen, we will together be playing not only for the credibility of the European Union, but also, to repeat the word used by Mr Havel just now, for its sovereignty. The first challenge is that of the crisis, and we must not – we cannot – come out of it as we went into it, as if nothing had happened. There are lessons to be learnt in our dialogue with the United States, in particular, regarding governance, regarding solidarity, regarding transparency and regulation of the global economy, and for we Europeans there are lessons to be learnt as regards the safeguarding – I use that word deliberately – the consolidation of the internal market, in the ‘reconciliation of the market and society’, to repeat a word that I have adopted as my own, used by Mario Monti, to whom President Barroso has moreover usefully entrusted a task on this issue. The second challenge is that of green growth. In Kyoto, we took the lead on this issue, thanks to the European Commission. We must maintain this position by ensuring, of course, that our partners, the other large countries, the large regions, adopt a reciprocal attitude. And then, the third challenge is for us to be at the table, not ‘behind the table’, but ‘at the table’, of those who are going to decide on the world order – or disorder – over the next 20 years. This is not easy when we number 27 nations, but it is crucial all the same, unless we do not mind – which I personally do – being subcontractors or being under the influence of the other countries. This is why we have a great deal of confidence in the future work of the High Representative, whose job it will be to create a real common diplomatic and strategic culture. Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the sooner we are ready, the better it will be for European citizens. That is why we eagerly and confidently await the decisions that you will take. Michel Barnier  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Mr Barroso, there are several elements to, and reasons for, our show of confidence and our very clear vote tomorrow. The first element is that of democratic consistency: with regard to the choice of the 27 Heads of State or Government who chose you unanimously; with regard to what we said during the electoral campaign – it was not so long ago – and with regard to the citizens’ vote. We are not going to apologise for having won the elections, even though we are aware – we are well aware, I would say to our fellow Members – that we will have to surround you with more ideas than those of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) alone. Then, there is democratic consistency with regard to the exercise that you have been conducting for several weeks, in the demanding, sincere and humble dialogue with Parliament, and we are here to bear witness to it. There is a second reason, which is a conviction: the very strong conviction that there will be no strong policies in Europe if the institutions are weak. We need strong institutions. This is why we hope that the Treaty of Lisbon will be ratified. It is a tool box that will make the institutions work. We need a strong Commission that can confront the crisis as quickly as possible. The third reason is a contract of confidence that we have signed with you. In the face of this, the most serious and most profound economic, financial, food – let us not forget the one billion starving people in the world – and environmental crisis, we need the Commission to show its fighting spirit. We need you, and us with you, to learn all the lessons from this crisis, in terms of governance, regulation, innovation and new policies – I am thinking of the idea of a European savings bank to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the strategic sectors – and, with regard to the most profound crisis, the environmental crisis, to introduce a new model of economic and social growth, of green growth, as you yourself said. That, Mr Barroso, is why we shall be ready, tomorrow, to sign the contract of confidence with you. Michel Barnier  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should, of course, like to thank Commissioner Dimas for his presence and his answers and for the attention that he continues to pay to all these disasters. We did a great deal of work together when President Barroso asked me to draft a report, which he also mentioned, on the creation of a European civil protection force. I presented this report on 9 May 2006. When I re-read it, and I see all the disasters that have happened, I realise that it is still topical. Mrs Tzavela, obviously, it is not just Greece. Every country is affected, and I would add that there are not only natural disasters, there are also human disasters, caused by mankind. I am thinking of maritime disasters – Erika
 and countless others – and of Chernobyl-type industrial accidents. There are natural disasters other than fires. I am thinking of the tsunami. One day we can expect a tsunami in the Mediterranean such as the one at the start of the 20th century that totally destroyed the city of Messina. Frankly, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tools we are using are not up to these disasters, which are going to increase under the twin effect of global warming and transport. Hence the reason why I think we should be more ambitious. I am grateful to the Commission, to Commissioner Dimas and to all his teams from the Directorate-General that are putting the civil protection mechanism into operation. I believe that we must go further. It is conceivable to have enhanced cooperation with those Member States that want it. If there are not 27 of us to make up this civil protection force, let us start with 12 or 15 of us. Then you will see that this affects everyone. When I compile the list of disasters, I can say that everyone is affected: the floods that hit Germany in 2002, the major pandemics and also terrorism. That, Commissioner, is why I would like the Commission to take the initiative to go further, to propose that the Member States go further. Our Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, will support you in these proactive initiatives.

 Controlling production volumes is an essential tool which must be made available to all bodies involved in defending and managing protected designations of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indications (PGI), following the example of the cheese sector with the adoption of the Milk Package in March 2012. This will enable them to maintain a high level of quality and added value in their products and avoid market imbalances. Unfortunately, the Council and the Commission were unable to reach an agreement on this provision, which was supported by a majority in Parliament. However, other points in the quality package represent real progress, for example, in terms of protecting against misuse and shortening procedures. The Council, which is divided on this issue, has nevertheless agreed to confirm in a statement that this debate is not closed, but that it will now be included in the discussions on the reform of the single common market organisation (CMO). That is why I do not wish to call into question the agreement reached with the Council, as this would block the adoption of the text and put the debate on volumes management on hold. I will therefore vote against the amendment authorising this mechanism, which I otherwise fully support. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 Mr President, the 2006 reform was supposed to improve the competitiveness of the sugar beet sector in Europe. This reform was carried out at great sacrifice in terms of men and land. Factories were closed. Whole areas of land had to abandon beet production. Cane sugar refiners are now calling for the suspension of tariffs on sugar without any trade negotiation. Increased imports of cane sugar from other third countries would undermine the preferences granted to our traditional partners in developing countries and could halt investments in these countries. The European Union sugar market is totally open. As far as I am concerned, any delay in investments in African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the least developed countries (LDCs) cannot justify the refiners’ demand to disregard them. As a rapporteur for this House on the common market organisation (CMO) in the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), the ACP countries that I have encountered have explicitly asked me to keep the system in place today. Ladies and gentlemen, this House has already, on a number of occasions, had discussions, regarding, in particular, the Dess report in July 2011 and Resolution No 2010/2110, passed in March 2011. Yes, we must defend jobs. However, under the pretext of defending dozens of industrial jobs, do we need to have more people abandoning our lands with the removal of European producers? For three years now, is it not the case that our Parliament has, all too often, affirmed and reaffirmed its determination to defend our food self-sufficiency and to promote our agriculture as much as possible?

 After an amazing campaign of misinformation, Parliament has rejected the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). Just one article concerned Internet users. The prime purpose of the text was to protect us against counterfeiting, in particular intellectual property. By rejecting it, we have paved the way for the relocation of jobs outside Europe and for an upsurge in the black economy, child labour and other forms of exploitation. Congratulations to those responsible for this failure. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 The final text put to the vote in Parliament does not take into consideration some scientific knowledge and portrays a caricature with regard to agricultural issues, showing a lack of understanding of the reality of agriculture, that is, the reality of 13.5 million European farmers.

 We should welcome the adoption of this text as some excellent work has been done. Whilst not entirely perfect, the policy changes are significant in comparison with decisions made in recent years, notably, the measure that gives producers the right to group together so that they gain greater clout in bargaining with processors and distributors. From now on, interprofessional agreements will be an integral part of the European vocabulary, and the right of producers of protected designation of origin (PDO) / protected geographic indication (PGI) cheeses to manage their production volumes has finally been recognised. Other improvements such as, the requirement of contracts in the supply chain, or a mechanism ensuring that disadvantaged regions are not ‘drained’ of their milk production upon the expiry of dairy quotas, must be achieved in the years to come. The ‘soft landing’ promised by the Commissioner at the time of drafting, Ms Fischer Boel, should well and truly become a reality for European producers. From now on, producers must fully embrace the new tools established by European legislation in order to help further their interests and to take part in the running of their market. Michel Dantin,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, we have reached the end of our work. Commissioner, we agree with some of the points you just made. There is one word, however, that I wish to highlight: the word ‘quickly’. I do not think that we can agree on that. It was in February three years ago that the milk crisis erupted or reached its peak. That is how long it has taken us to reach a compromise allowing us to offer milk producers new prospects. I welcome the spirit in which we worked and congratulate our rapporteur, who, for this first, because it was a first for us to legislate together, enabled us to work in a spirit of genuine dialogue and with a shared desire to build something. We are therefore offering producers a new capacity, that of derogating from competition law and organising themselves into stronger units. However, Commissioner, we all know only too well that this is just one stage, just one step, and that we have not yet found the real solution and the real tools to move beyond the era of milk quotas. An exit phase should be prepared. That phase has not yet been designed. We have to continue to work on that aspect. As you said, we have not yet completely resolved the issue of vulnerable regions either. Even if we are offering them a tool, with the possibility of organising themselves better with the geographical protection mechanisms, we are still not enabling them to keep milk in those regions. It is absolutely essential for the report that you are going to submit to us in 2014 to set out solutions that allow us to maintain this activity in vulnerable regions, where grass is often the only production and where milk is often the only way of making a living. Without it, all of the work and all of the hopes that we have put in this text will be in vain for many farmers. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, you fulfil your duties well. You defend a text with conviction. This is not your text, however. It is an inherited text. We know very well that, if you had had to negotiate this text yourself, it would have been different because you are currently involved in the CAP negotiations and you are aware that it is difficult to impose environmental constraints on European farmers when texts such as this proposal ignore that issue completely. You are aware that it is difficult to establish a common framework for the CAP because the standard of living differs from one EU country to another. Here, we are not taking into account the standard of living of Moroccan producers, whom, we are supposed to believe, represent El Dorado. Yes, the situation is complicated as I am sure that nobody here in this House wants to jeopardise Morocco’s development. Morocco is a country that we need for stability in North Africa. Morocco is a gateway for developing new trade and we know that every time we develop new trade, both parties benefit to some extent. However, I will get back to what I was saying about the environment. How are we going to explain to European farmers that we are perhaps going to force them to comply with the Water Framework Directive under the system of cross-compliance but that at the same time we are not going to pay any attention to the production conditions of the tomatoes that are allowed to enter? How are we going to explain to them that the water table is falling by two metres per year in some regions but that that is being ignored? I firmly believe that the model that we are proposing to the Moroccans is not a sustainable model. Perhaps our producers do not have to worry because, with the system they are being offered, Moroccan producers will die before them. This is serious, however. In my opinion, we have to defend Morocco, we have to defend democracy in Morocco but we also have to take care to ensure that what we are proposing is balanced from an environmental, social and economic perspective. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is now three years since the debate on the aid programme for the most deprived got desperately bogged down in Council. This untenable deadlock is not acceptable. It is all the more unacceptable given that the death sentence has been pronounced on the programme at a time when our continent is going through an economic and social crisis of unprecedented violence, which is throwing so many of our fellow citizens into turmoil. Some symbols construct Europe; others weaken it dangerously. Let us ensure that we do not destroy today what was patiently constructed yesterday, especially at a time when the difficulties we face seem to be straining the bonds that unite our States. Those same difficulties are pushing people towards nationalist sentiments and to turn their backs on Europe. Re-establishing the every man for himself principle as a normal and acceptable reflex is far removed from my idea of Europe and from that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), to which I belong. Our people deserve better. They deserve the Europe we have been building together for more than 50 years – a Europe that is more than a simple economic agreement. Quite the opposite, Europe embodies values that, more than ever, we need to embrace – values that place human beings at the top of the political agenda. Today, it is imperative that we move away from sterile legal debate in order to take fair and responsible political decisions. Allocating resources to the European Social Fund within a fund created specifically for that purpose under the revised common agricultural policy is not what the debate is about. It is no longer what the debate is about. The ruling of the Court of Justice has now created an emergency which will soon affect 18 million people receiving food aid. The real question now relates to our common vision of Europe and its future. I am convinced that its destiny does not, under any circumstances, lie in the full or partial renationalisation of food aid, however symbolically. Let there be no mistake: only if we act together will we succeed in tackling the huge challenges we face today. It is only by acting together, showing solidarity and standing united that, on our continent, we will retain the resources to guarantee the future prosperity of all our fellow citizens. Commissioner, you have courageously proposed measures. It is high time that ... (The President cut off the speaker) Michel Dantin,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Dess, the shadow rapporteurs and other contributors on the work that they have done to draft this text. In my opinion, it is both balanced and ambitious. We will be voting on the report tomorrow. Almost six months after Mr Lyon drafted his report setting out the European Parliament’s views on the common agricultural policy (CAP) post-2013, the European Commission decided to draw on the report by including many of its ideas in the communication issued on 18 November 2010. The new report, which was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, affirms the new direction that we would like the common agricultural policy to take in the coming years. Our farmers are not there to produce mere commodities, or wares to sell. They are there, above all, to produce food for Europe’s 500 million citizens, but also to help to feed the rest of the world. Stating it in these terms is not just semantics: it is a philosophical choice that we are making. Mr Dess’s report endorses a positive approach to agriculture’s environmental and ecological contribution and therefore appeals for a reduction of the often onerous administrative procedures generated by European and national legislation. By arguing in favour of graduated direct payments and a review of the regulatory instruments, the report also provides a new perspective on social perception of the CAP and of global trade. As we speak, the G20 in Paris is beginning discussions on regulating the global commodities markets, with particular reference to agricultural commodities. Parliament’s approach, then, has not been defined in a vacuum, where we are cut off from the world. Rather, it is part of the wider deliberations on how to come up with a global response to a global challenge. As with Mr Lyon’s report one year ago and Mr Garriga Polledo’s report on the financial perspectives last month, tomorrow we will be voting in favour of maintaining the agricultural budget for the 2014-2020 programming period. I am sure that it will be a close-run thing, but we do need to take a stand and to make choices, because we will not have the money to do everything ...

 Mr President, I should like to thank the Spanish producers who submitted this timely petition to us. Indeed, for months now, we in Parliament have been warning the Commission of the danger to our internal market of a number of bilateral agreements. Clearly, we are sensitive to the issue of Morocco’s development. Clearly, we know that creating stability for the Moroccan people in their own country is the best possible solution, and that it will stop us from having to solve numerous immigration problems in the future. However, when the Commission tells us that a new agreement will simply ratify a situation, we can plainly see, through the reports by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), that the situation to which the Commission refers is not the real solution. Furthermore, I should like to alert the Commission to another point. We are told that the negotiated – the renegotiated – agreements will enable us to support Moroccan producers. Which producers are we talking about, though? The exporters are primarily large agri-food companies that have set up huge farms in Morocco. Small Moroccan producers are not the ones who benefit from our agreements, as they do not have the capacity to produce in conditions acceptable to the European market. Let us not confuse the issue, but do not mislead the MEPs either: that is my request to the Commission. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for my group, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the conditions in which we were able to work with him on this matter. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe this is a truly strategic matter at the moment. We have already heard about China. I should like to quote a figure: in 2010, the Chinese bought 49% of the soymeal placed on the market. The forecast for 2011 is that the same customers will buy 57% of the total quantities placed on the market. Hence, it really is a matter of European independence that we are looking at in the medium term. Imagine for a moment that some very intensive farming regions found themselves without imported soya for a week: what would happen? We urgently need to redevelop these crops in our region. My country introduced a policy in the context of Article 68 back in 2010. This policy demonstrated that production could be adapted to policies.

Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I believe that we should be pleased, because we may be talking about a crisis today, but this is because our system has worked. We have the strongest consumer protection system in the world. Consumers need to bear that in mind right now. However, the system did not work properly, and before we come up with another one, I believe that we must carefully and comprehensively look at the reasons why the problem was discovered so late, and we must ask ourselves about the causes of this delay. However, I think that, apart from denouncing the criminal act itself, we must also question why it happened. I believe that, because of our actions, the agricultural and agri-food sectors are in a race towards low costs and towards the lowest prices on the supply side, and we are no longer shielded from deviations such as this type of unacceptable behaviour. So, Commissioner, do you intend to increase the penalties for such acts? My second question is about how we will provide immediate support – and I mean immediate – to the breeders concerned. This is because the margins are so weak that, if some people do not receive support very soon, or even advances on amounts owed to them, these breeders will disappear by the time the procedure reaches a conclusion at what I would call ‘normal’ speed. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, I think that the Member who asked a question actually had a comment to make on a situation rather than a question to put to me. Obviously, we know that the system has gone wrong. However, with regard to European consumers, I would like to emphasise how strict our protection system is. We cannot let the statement that nothing has been done go unchallenged, given that we have the highest standards in the world. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in the thanks and congratulations addressed to those who have managed to conclude these very difficult negotiations. We are getting ready to approve a budget tomorrow which is a big step forward for the Europe of mobility and the Europe of young people. Above all, this budget demonstrates Parliament’s determination not to abandon large-scale European investments during this crisis period. However, I would like to share with you my concern and my displeasure about the choice made today by some political groups and, in particular, the Socialists, whose representatives were in government jobs at key moments, to jeopardise ITER, the only fundamental long-term research project in the European Union in which we play a leading role. As you know, the European Union made a commitment last June to contribute an additional EUR 1.3 billion to this project, which is crucial for our security. It is therefore Europe’s credibility in the world that is going to be called into question by our vote. This attitude has meant that we have lost nearly EUR 600 million of unused money in 2010, which could have been allocated to ITER. This is ridiculous! Michel Dantin  (PPE

 Mr President, our fellow citizens have expectations of us, they have expectations of Europe on the issue of world governance. We must be a proactive force, we must be a decisive force. Several speakers this morning have made the point that the French Presidency of the G20 could represent an opportunity for Europe. I clearly share this view, and I believe that our Parliament ought to be regularly informed of the progress of the G20’s work by the Presidency itself. I understand that the President of the French Republic would be willing to come and address us. Mr President, I think that you should invite him to do so. Michel Dantin,

Madam President, Commissioner, you have a good command of the French language and you know my country well. In France, there is an expression that describes something one dreams of but which never materialises, we talk about the Arlésienne
. For farmers, simplification is undoubtedly one of the forms, one of the faces of the Arlésienne
. As you have said, the Commission has already taken action to try and simplify procedures and I would like to go into a bit more detail. To my mind, there are two aspects to this issue. Firstly, there is everything to do with the requests for aid. I think it should be recognised that there has been an effort to simplify the paperwork during these last few years and months, and we give you credit for that. Secondly, there are the restrictions relating to all the conditions, the never-ending reporting requested from farmers for everything they do: taking a trailer full of manure to a field, using a dose of fertiliser in another field, using a dose of plant protection product in a third field, and if they make a mistake, they are sanctioned. Faced with this situation, Commissioner, I believe that we certainly need to find solutions. Last week, while presenting the proposal for the future common agricultural policy, you mentioned a few integrative measures that could be implemented and that could, in fact, lead, through the outcome produced by these measures, to measures that can be controlled by opinion, by farmers as well as by the Commission, measures for which we can be sure of the scientific effect. I have in mind the example of crop rotation. These measures should enable us to simplify the obligations imposed on farmers. This represents a considerable amount of work for the future. Furthermore, today as you did last week, you mentioned what is incumbent on Member States and I think you are right. Every year, the Commission controllers visit Member States before visiting the farmers. They go there with a critical eye to find what is not right. Yet could we not change their mission slightly, Commissioner, and ask them to also list – this would be beneficial to the Member States – areas where the Member States are going too far in applying EU legislation? Going too far is to impose on farmers obligations which are pointless in relation to the regulations. By doing so, you would have improved Europe’s image among our fellow citizens.

Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has been said, for bees are indeed a symbolic species, guardians of our environment. Currently, there are many research programmes dedicated to bees, with sometimes contradictory findings. A few days ago, a scientist came to see me and explained that the numerous planes that we can see in the sky have an effect on the diffraction of sun rays, leading to exhaustion and therefore to the excessive mortality of bees, for instance. Contrary to what one of our fellow Members on the right of this Chamber just said, I believe that here we have an example of a sector where pooling our knowledge and coordinating research programmes can provide a solution to the problems faced by each of our countries. Yes, Europe can be useful. This example of bees is maybe representative of European integration. Michel Dantin  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what a funny old world the agricultural world is! A year ago, in this Chamber, we were all bemoaning the general production situation. Today, one production sector, the cereal sector, is doing better than the others – and I think we should, all the same, welcome that. However, its success is unfortunately having very serious repercussions for another sector, the livestock sector. The real issue today is the agricultural industry’s inability to pass on the costs it has to incur to consumers. Therefore, as has already been said this morning, we need to help organise producers so that they can make their presence felt in their dealings with their customers and, in particular, in their dealings with the large-scale distribution sector. However, the chain, the functioning of the markets is more pernicious. How can we explain the fact that, for years, decades, we said that South American countries were placing a strain on production and bringing prices down? How can we explain that, although prices are today increasing again in those countries, we cannot pass on that increase to our producers because, yes, there has been an increase in costs, but – and this must also be said – there has been no increase in producer prices? How can we fail to mention the cost differentials that exist between our countries? Admittedly, this is partly a question of national responsibilities. However, the dumping that goes on today between our various countries helps destabilise markets, and I believe that Europe should tackle this issue. Yes, solutions must be found. European cereal producers are aware, I think, of the situation faced by their main customers – farmers. They are prepared to enter into a contractual agreement. Are you prepared, Commissioner, to support that agreement? Michel Dantin  (PPE

The amendment I tabled along with Mr Dess and 77 other MEPs demands full compliance by agricultural imports with European health, social, and consumer, environmental and animal protection standards. It is, after all, extraordinary to demand that European farmers conform to the highest production standards in the world, while at the same time increasing the quantity of agricultural products that can enter Europe without meeting those same standards. Consumers must be able to benefit from a single level of protection, no matter what they buy, and farmers must be rewarded for their tremendous efforts, not subjected to de facto 
unfair competition on the part of third countries. That is my idea of a balanced food and agriculture policy, anyway. This resolution sends a clear message to the Commission and to third countries, which is why I support it. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 France is one of the countries of the Union with the highest birth rates. This is due to a set of measures contained in an all-embracing family policy. The resolution as it stands after the votes on the amendments does not bring about any real improvement. On the contrary, it will throw everything into question because the budgetary burden of the measures cannot be borne at this time. Those are the reasons that led me to withhold approval from the text, which is, incidentally, well meaning. Michel Dantin  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report entrusted to our fellow Member, Mr Bové, addresses what is, today, a crucial issue for society, from consumers to producers. The Commission’s figures speak volumes, Commissioner: 20 years ago, milk producers received 31% of the chain’s turnover, which back then equated to just over EUR 450 million. Today, they receive only 24% of the turnover, or just under EUR 550 million. Other examples exist with regard to fruit, meat and so on. Clarifying pricing is therefore today a prerequisite for reforming the common agricultural policy (CAP) because, if we do not clarify it, the CAP will, in future, seem like a bottomless pit in the eyes of the public and of farmers themselves. The CAP’s profits are today being siphoned off, but for the benefit of whom, of what? Ladies and gentlemen, it is our duty to understand what is going on. Contrary to what I am hearing from certain quarters, producers are no less well organised today than they were 20 or 30 years ago. However, the other stakeholders have grown, and the number of producers has decreased even more rapidly than that of farmers. The chain has become longer, too. This situation requires us to adapt competition law and to supplement the market crisis management tools, which no longer seem suited to the new architecture of the chains linking producers to consumers. Lastly, there is the specific issue of quality products, in particular, with regard to imported imitations. We need clarity. Commissioner, your services are examining the functioning of the French prices and margins observatory. There is room for improvement, but it already contains a wealth of information on consumer-level pricing and on the niches where margins are hidden. I should like to commend the work that has also been done by our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Köstinger. Attacks have been made here and there today. One of the merits of our Parliament is that we respect different points of view. This is also the case with regard to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Everyone remains free to vote as they wish. For my part, I shall not compromise my vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Michel Dantin,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Lyon, as well as the team of shadow rapporteurs, who I feel cooperated effectively with him on this report. As far as our group is concerned, this report conveys an ambition for European agriculture. It was written following the raw material crises of 2007 and 2008 and following the farming crisis of 2009, which taught us that liberalism is not the solution for agriculture. Our agriculture is firstly intended to provide – to guarantee – food security for 450 million Europeans, but we must also take our place on solvent markets. It is clear that the conditions that have prevailed since the middle of the 20th century have evolved, that techniques have evolved and must still evolve, that they must change, and that agricultural policy instruments must also evolve. Agriculture must be supported in this evolution. While the first pillar, financed solely from the EU budget, must support the level of societal demands that we attach to agriculture, the second, cofinanced pillar must continue to support the modernisation of agriculture and agri-foods so as to take the new contexts into account. This policy will also have to be fairer – yes, I did say fairer – between countries and between farmers themselves. It is clearly our wish to give hope back to the 14 million farmers and their families, in particular to ensure the replacement of the 4.5 million farmers who, today, are over 60 and who are going to leave the profession. The issue of generational change will be one of our concerns. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent work that has been done. The text has developed between the two readings, and seems to be going in the right direction. In the year since we began discussing this issue, I have noticed that the public – at least in my region – is baffled when they see how little coordination there is between rail companies today. How can we, in this House, legitimately call for more ambition with regard to the environment? Should we merely express our regret that Copenhagen was not a complete success, when we in Europe are incapable of actually shifting our freight transport to rail, either purely to rail or to multimodal transport? Some sectors of multimodal transport have developed, and it has taken time for road hauliers to adapt, but they have been able to appreciate the complementary nature of this system and demonstrate that it is effective. We cannot have a debate today if nothing comes of it afterwards; we have an obligation to act, and to act quickly. It is true that, beyond this text, there may be some problems here and there with infrastructure. I would particularly like to draw your attention, Commissioner, to the issue of cross-border sections. They are often nobody’s responsibility, yet they are the link we need to successfully complete our European project. I have also heard some parties, and more specifically the social partners, express the fear that some powers may be lost. However, I am convinced that the success of this project will provide an opportunity for us to work harder, and to work harder together. I feel this is very much an issue on which Europe can show its practical side to our fellow citizens. We certainly need this. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioner, as you well know, agriculture is an economic sector that comprises specific features that mean that public intervention may occasionally be necessary, if not desirable, in the interests of producers, consumers and the public. There are at least three reasons why public intervention in this economic sector is as justifiable in the European Union as it is in other countries of the world. The characteristics of supply of agricultural goods and the demand for foodstuffs make agricultural markets unstable. Agriculture also produces non-market goods and helps ensure a certain degree of social stability in our countries and our countryside through the jobs that it creates. Above all, agriculture is the basis of an abundant, varied and healthy food supply. Can we be satisfied, then, with the current economic situation of our rural areas and our farmers? A few days ago, Commissioner, a senior official gave me the following figures for his département
 – as it happens, this is a French département
 that you know well, a livestock farming department. The administrative centre holds 2 500 agricultural accounts. Of those, 800 have a debt ratio in excess of 80%, and 20% have a debt ratio of 100% or more. Faced with such figures – which, I admit, surprised even me – the issue to be dealt with today is not just one of revenue but of the decapitalisation of European agriculture. Less aid, less public intervention and more restrictions on production: that is a truly explosive combination. It is true that the general economic crisis is aggravating the situation. However, we must also question certain decisions taken by the Commission, certain decisions taken by your colleagues, Commissioner. Agriculture remains a bargaining chip in trade agreements. Despite the situation in Europe, meat, certain cereals, fruits and vegetables are all affected. The recent agreement between the European Union and the Andean countries, in particular, Peru and Colombia, will sacrifice the producers of the outermost regions. We cannot continue with such a policy. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Mr President, Mrs Paulsen, thank you for your report. I would like to applaud the work that has been done by the various shadow rapporteurs as part of the preparation for this dossier and, in particular, the rapporteur for my group, Mrs Jeggle. This issue resonates differently in the various European countries. Not all producers or consumers perceive the issue in the same way. In spite of this, European legislation is gradually succeeding in creating a very strict standard, which I feel we should make much better use of in international negotiations and, in particular, in the control of imported products. However, as has already been said, these rules carry a cost, and every day we are seeing this cost rise for farmers and other operators, at the very time when the profitability of farming is being hit hard. This is, therefore, a clear justification for the common agricultural policy. If we spend EUR 100 per head per year to finance a common agricultural policy, animal welfare is one good reason why this funding is needed. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Mr President, I would like to thank our colleague, Mr Dorfmann, for his excellent work on this report. I think it sums up perfectly the issue as it stands today in terms of the Commission’s proposals. It is the Commissioner whom I would like to address in particular. This work has been going on for several months now. It is creating great agitation within several of our countries’ industries, which are threatened with reclassification, and this reclassification is happening or may happen at a time when – and this will be the subject of tomorrow evening’s oral question – many production sectors are experiencing particular difficulties. We therefore need to move forward and move forward quickly. I do not think we can wait three years to come up with a clear answer for the farmers who are affected by this delimitation exercise. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Scottà, I find it truly symbolic, Commissioner, that your first speech before this House should be on the very subject of quality policy. I believe that we take the same approach to these quality products. Yes, they represent an opportunity for our most fragile regions. Yes, they are a means by which to make the operators of a region and, in particular, farmers, more dynamic. Yes, they represent a strong signal sent out to European consumers, but also to consumers throughout the world, with regard to our agricultural model. Burgundy wine, Parma ham, certain Spanish meats – they have meaning far beyond the borders of each of our countries, far beyond the borders of Europe. The resolution that we shall no doubt adopt tomorrow offers you, Commissioner, a greater degree of ambition with regard to this policy of quality products, of products identified by different signs. European policy must be clearer; it must stop producers from being taken over by certain large industrial or distribution groups, which would clearly like to deprive producers of the benefit of the added value that these products give them. During the hearing, I drew your attention to the need to give organisations that bear, in particular, designations of origin overall responsibility for managing their products. Management of production rights is a fundamental part of quality production policy. Moreover, almost all of our committee voted in favour of an amendment along these lines. I should like to respond to our UK fellow Members with regard to paragraph 19 on the fruit and vegetables sector. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we must not go backwards, but neither must we allow the huge vacuum in fruit and vegetable policy that means that, today, distributors are the only ones calling the shots. Let us together interpret this amendment as a call to find a new middle way. Commissioner, you can very quickly convince us of your enthusiasm for this specific policy, which gives consumers a different image of agriculture. Now present us with a good text. Do so quickly; we have faith in you. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, thank you, once again, for your attention. The price crisis in 2007-2008 highlighted the weak position of consumers with regard to price volatility. The agricultural crisis of 2009 is having a much more detrimental effect on farms than the indices reveal. Why? Because the upward trend in agricultural prices was portrayed by many as sustainable, and because farmers without doubt invested far too much in 2008 and at the beginning of 2009 – far too much because a delay has built up since the beginning of the 2000s. On several occasions, Commissioner, you have expressed a desire to no longer intervene in market regulation in the same way. But have we failed to remember over the last 20 years that agricultural commodities are primarily food products and that we need a certain degree of price stability at both ends of the chain? Price stability is required at consumer level, on the one hand, because, due to other financial commitments such as mortgages, parenting and leisure activities, the consumer does not have enough leftover income to cope with price fluctuations. At producer level, on the other hand, price stability is required because business activity involves significant capital, which requires heavy investment. Organisation within the sectors that includes all the elements of the supply chain, as well as the new players – I am referring to the mass catering sector and processing companies for quick-frozen or even fresh-prepared products – can undoubtedly lead to the introduction of private tools for stabilising prices. Do you think it is possible to find a way forward with this, Commissioner, and is the Commission ready to participate in such discussions? Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your statement, which I believe reflects the remarkable work you have done during your mandate. Europe has chosen a food model to protect its population. Our fellow citizens are ready to pay EUR 100 per year per capita if we guarantee the quality of their food. The other day in committee, we learnt of the Food and Veterinary Office’s report. I must tell you that, as a new MEP, I was deeply concerned to see the discomfort of your staff, who obviously could not answer or did not want to answer our questions. Commissioner, should we be ashamed of having strict rules to protect our consumers? Should we be ashamed of imposing these rules on those who want to feed our consumers? Are we ashamed when, in order to sell aircraft or cars, these same countries force us to establish this or that factory or impose this or that condition on us? Our market access conditions are important conditions because they affect food and they affect the health of our residents. We have nothing to be ashamed of. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner – I would have liked to have been able to address the Presidency of the Council too – ladies and gentlemen, as you yourself acknowledged the other day, Commissioner, to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the price paid to dairy producers no longer covers the current costs of production. What that means is that our producers are in the process of decapitalising. Just now, you listed the measures you have taken in the past nine months. Those measures do exist, we will grant you that. They have not, however, produced the anticipated effects because, in our view, they are not extensive enough, and there is definitely too much uncertainty about how effective their target is. This morning you mentioned a recovery in the market, but the producers will certainly only see the effects of this in the payments made at the beginning of next year. The agricultural products market is not the same as the market in metals or the energy market. It calls for regulatory tools, because the cycles of the seasons and nature also have an effect on market conditions. Your interpretation of the health check, carried out under the French Presidency, surprises us, since the interim assessments that it produced in relation to the dairy sector leave all avenues open, including the possibility of new decisions on tools for regulating the markets. The French delegation, to which I belong, is convinced that a renewed quotas system will be necessary after 2013. The tension that existed on the food products market prior to the current economic crisis has demonstrated the fragility of the balance across the world between production and consumption. After having partially dismantled the intervention tools, we have neither the right nor the legitimacy to dismantle today the production tools that we will need in the short term. Commissioner, we must give farmers back their dignity: these are men and women who are not afraid of hard work. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 Madam President, Mr Diamandouros, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us give the People’s Europe a face. It is the responsibility of all the European institutions to do everything in their power so that citizens are informed of all their means of redress if there are violations of Community law or bad administration by European institutions. First of all, I would like to praise the work of my colleague, Mrs Nedelcheva, for her report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2009. The European Commission has been the object of most of the Ombudsman’s criticism, often for a lack of information. The report by my fellow Member, Mrs Paliadeli, whom I would also like to congratulate, is a glaring example. Next, I would like to thank our European Ombudsman for all the work that has been accomplished, together with his whole team, and for his accessibility and his excellent collaboration with the Committee on Petitions. This is very important. His role represents an important safeguard of respect for the principle of transparency and good administration, and it is there that we will obtain genuine protection for our fellow citizens. Finally, it is time that our fellow citizens were better informed of the means of redress available to them with regard to the European Commission: namely, the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions. In order to do that, we need an Internet portal, certainly, but we need a common one, as we have already requested from you. This would provide real help to our citizens. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 I did not wish to support this report insofar as an increase from 14 to 20 weeks on full pay would have catastrophic financial consequences for several Member States. The OECD study shows that there will be very substantial costs for the social budgets of Member States. For France, the annual amount is EUR 1.3 billion, and for the United Kingdom GBP 2.4 billion. In the current economic situation, increases in these budgets cannot be absorbed. What is more, businesses would have to bear these additional costs, which is impossible. However, supporting women during maternity is essential. Applying these measures poses a very great risk to the employment of women. The OECD study also shows that extending maternity leave would result in a decrease in female employment. In wishing to help women, there is a risk of penalising them in the job market. I wish to help women in their employment and to support them during maternity. The increase from 14 to 18 weeks proposed by the Commission was a real step forward. Another advance would have been to have progressive measures concerning childcare methods. Pascale Gruny  (PPE
),

Firstly, the fact that combating poverty has been taken into account in the 2020 strategy is, for me, a significant advance. The economic crisis has intensified the problem of poverty in recent years. The European Union must be able to encourage Member States to face up to this problem. Secondly, the European Social Fund (ESF) is an essential European tool in combating poverty. I am the rapporteur for the European Social Fund and I support its use in order to get back to work the people who are furthest away from the labour market. This has been the ESF’s role since it was set up under the Treaty of Rome, and it must keep employment as its prime objective. Thirdly, I am against a minimum income without contributing in return, except for people who are unfit for work. Employment is the benchmark in reducing poverty. It is the only way of giving back dignity to everyone. Fourthly, the governments of Member States have a responsibility to combat poverty actively. Europe is there to support them and to complement what they do but not to take their place. Europe cannot cure all ills. Above all, Member States must face up to their responsibilities. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need European legislation that will protect the health of pregnant women and women who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding, and we must rise to the demographic challenge we are facing and encourage an increase in birth rates in Europe. However, this advance must not serve as a disincentive to employ women. I would emphasise three points. Firstly, I welcome the European Commission’s proposal on the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. Indeed, I would emphasise the title, which is the legal framework of this directive, because too often, we tend to forget what exactly this text is about. We are talking here about women because, until we receive proof to the contrary, men cannot give birth. The debate tends to become diluted as a result of the reference made to paternity or parental leave. Let us solve the problem faced by women first, by focusing on their health when they bring a child into the world. We must implement genuine guarantees to protect the health of these women in the labour market. Paternity and parental leave will be dealt with in another directive. Secondly, the debate revolves around the number of weeks. Currently, the average leave period is set at 14 weeks. The European Commission is proposing 18 weeks and the report 20. Obviously, as a woman and mother of three children, I want mothers to be able to stay with their babies for as long as possible. However, this then begs the question: who is going to pay for this extension from 14 to 20 weeks? The state? Businesses? I am convinced that the average increase from 14 to 18 weeks is a major European advance and a real investment by our economy towards promoting a rise in birth rates in Europe. Twenty weeks is liable to have a negative impact on female employment: it would put a brake on their employment. Businesses and our States cannot support this additional huge financial burden at this time of crisis. Thirdly, more priority must be given to improving childcare so that mothers can achieve a work-life balance. Little progress has been made on this matter despite the many appeals by our Parliament. Therefore, let us not be counterproductive and let us not send women back home. Pascale Gruny  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a pivotal moment in the debate on the future of the European Social Fund (ESF). At a time when employment has become the number one preoccupation of all countries and all European regions, I am proud of the resolution Parliament has proposed today on the future of the ESF. This text is responsible, concrete and opens doors to the future. Now more than ever, our territories need a cohesion policy and thus, support from the European structural funds. The ESF has been in place since 1957 and was established by the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, the Treaty of Rome. Its legitimacy is not in doubt. My position on the future of the ESF is simple and clear and can be summarised in three points. First, a European Social Fund must remain focused on employment, combating poverty, of course, but by getting people into work and not by other means. Today, employment must have our full attention and must be our priority. I am convinced that a person who returns to employment is also a person who regains his human dignity. Second, an effective European Social Fund must have clear, pragmatic rules that do not discourage operators. That is why I support my political group, which is calling for greater visibility for the ESF, particularly to improve its uptake. Just imagine, budget allocations are sometimes returned unused to the European Union, while unemployment rates have never been so high. Third, and finally, we need a fund that is included in the broader framework of a strong European cohesion policy. Decisions must be taken on the ESF with partners that are as close to the ground as possible. Commissioners, can you assure us that the ESF will meet these expectations? Pascale Gruny,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, we need long-term legislation to improve employment in Europe and reduce poverty. We need to address the problem of unemployment with a view to sustainable growth. I should like to make three points. First of all, the Council proposes that the guidelines for employment policies in the Member States be established every 10 years. I agree, because we need a long-term perspective, but then we also need real milestones every three years to ensure that we do not lose sight of developments on the labour market. Secondly, I tabled an amendment, which was not adopted, in which I proposed that an employment observatory be established to conduct a specific analysis of future jobs. Many young people leave school or university without any training that meets the needs of the labour market. We need to anticipate future jobs. Our young people should be able to move forward and specialise by completing training which will ensure that they keep up with the employment market. Finally, the fight against unemployment not only entails doing everything to improve the employment situation in Europe, but also in combating poverty. The professional integration of people who have been out of work for a long time is vital in the fight against poverty. The European Social Fund is the instrument which can help bring these people back to the labour market. Let us start by giving these people their dignity back, by giving them jobs, and let us avoid helping them with no prospect of social integration. I would stress this point. Pascale Gruny,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Iturgaiz Angulo on his work. I agree with the content of the report, and do not wish to return to that particular subject. However, I would like to stress two important issues raised by Mr Iturgaiz Angulo. First of all, it is important to inform the citizens of the difference between the citizens’ initiative, the process of submitting a petition to the European Parliament, and the role of the European Ombudsman. There is still too much confusion regarding the role of each instrument. Secondly, when I go to meet citizens in my constituency, I realise that they have never heard of the right to submit a petition to the European Parliament. How can we ensure that the citizens have a clearer picture and that they are able to mobilise existing resources to their advantage? In view of this, it is vitally important for the European Parliament to possess better communication tools. Are you aware that no website currently exists to clearly explain how to submit a petition? By the same token, there is no information available to people submitting petitions which would allow them to follow, in real time, the progress of their petitions to Parliament. There is no good reason for this lack of transparency. A greater level of visibility is needed so that the citizens become aware of the fact that we are there to support them. Our committee exists and works for their benefit, and we are there to listen to them. The European Parliament must do everything within its power to close this communication gap and to highlight the work that has been carried out. This work is not of a legislative nature, that is true, but it is no less important. The citizens should be our main concern, and our committee works towards this objective each and every day. Pascale Gruny,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is only one lesson to be learned here, namely, that full-time contracts of an indefinite duration must remain the norm. First of all, I would like to thank all the colleagues who contributed to the drawing up of this report. Today, I am disappointed that a debate has not been held on a matter which lies at the heart of the 2020 strategy. A number of my colleagues wished to speak on the subject, but were not given the opportunity to do so. Nevertheless, I would strongly encourage them to submit their contributions, in written form, to Parliament’s services. I am also disappointed that, having worked closely with all the political groups to achieve an agreement after numerous consultations, an alternative resolution, which is almost identical to my report, has been tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. My group cannot support the two elements which Mrs Schroedter has added to the alternative resolution, and which the Committee had rejected in a vote. First of all, with regard to the basis of these proposals, which concern, above all, ‘false’ self-employed persons: it is true that these are a real, widespread problem. As the report mentions, we would like a better definition of self-employed persons, but we must also ensure that the criterion pertaining to non self-employed persons is clearly defined, rather than relying on the presumption of employee status. The definition proposed by the Greens is much more vague and does not provide any added value to the text adopted by the Committee. Secondly, with regard to the call for a directive to guarantee the same rights to all workers, including the right to freedom of association, irrespective of their professional status; I do not quite understand exactly to what rights this refers, or who is preventing employees or self-employed persons from joining or forming a union. In my opinion, it is pointless to call for such a directive, and the matter falls outside of the European institutions’ sphere of competence. In my report, I wanted to make full-time contracts of an indefinite duration the norm and condemn the exploitative replacement of regular jobs with atypical contracts. I would like to remind you that the principle of flexicurity implies not only flexibility, in order to adapt to the demands of the labour market but, above all, it also refers to job security, and the one principle cannot be implemented at the expense of the other. The European Union must intensify its efforts to invest in skills and training in order to support sustainable employment. The unemployment rate remains far too high in the European Union, and atypical contracts therefore do have a role to play on the labour market. With regard to young people, atypical contracts could, for example, provide them with their first experience of the labour market. If atypical contracts could provide young people with an opportunity, and make it easier for them to become salaried employees with contracts of an indefinite duration, then I would support these kinds of contracts. With regard to people who face a long period of unemployment, once again, if an atypical contract facilitates their transition back onto the labour market, then I am in favour of this kind of contract. Finally, if an atypical contract is used in the context of moving from one job to another or from one professional status to another, then, once again, I would support this kind of contract, as the main aim is to keep people in employment. I would also stress the vital role played by the social partners and civil society organisations in the drawing up and implementation of employment policies. I call on all the Member States to ensure their full participation, as all too often, their level of involvement varies from one Member State to another. Finally, we must ensure that they enjoy an improved level of recognition, at both social and institutional level. In this report, the European Parliament is sending out a strong signal to the governments of the Member States and to the Commission. Secure career paths are an essential aspect of a social Europe. The ball is now in the European Council’s court. I hope that the Council will stand by its resolutions in the field of employment, adopted in the spring of 2010. The European Union needs a clear focus and specific measures to protect employment in our regions and to create new opportunities, within the framework of the 2020 strategy. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 The directive that we are debating today is the fruit of very lengthy negotiations in the European Parliament over two mandates. This is a very sensitive issue, as it concerns our jobs both today and in the future. It is a matter of road safety and of fair competition between companies in the Member States. I would not accept social dumping within our Union itself. Could an independent driver work 14 hours a day, 84 hours a week, and not be a risk on the roads? Compared with a company-employed driver, this is unfair competition. This also leads some companies to suggest to their employees that they declare themselves self-employed. We must protect our fellow citizens and our companies. I therefore invite the European Commission to withdraw its proposal and, failing that, I call on MEPs, during tomorrow’s vote in plenary, to vote in favour of keeping self-employed workers within the scope of working time legislation. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the European Parliament is sending out a strong message to women who assist their spouses in their self-employed work. From now on, their social rights will be considerably enhanced, and I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, on the work she has done. Europe must protect. Under the new definition of ‘assisting spouse’, spouses and partners will be eligible for social protection in the event of sickness or retirement. Bakers’ spouses will now be able to benefit from social rights. It is regrettable, however, that the Council did not agree to compulsory membership, but simply adopted the system of voluntary membership. Maternity leave is also provided for all women. The new text provides for a minimum period of maternity leave for self-employed women and wives of self-employed workers throughout the European Union. The duration of this leave is currently set at 14 weeks. I am the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for the directive on the health and safety at work of pregnant workers. I sincerely hope that, with the adoption of this text, the duration of maternity leave will be increased; and why not subsequently increase it for self-employed women? To conclude, Europe has proposed some creative and pragmatic solutions to help couples to reconcile professional and family life. It is now time to switch to taking action and to implement the proposals as quickly as possible. Europe’s campaign to protect women is making headway with this text. However, we MEPs must continue to eliminate the inequalities between men and women. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all in agreement today in welcoming the measures to simplify the awarding of the Structural Funds proposed in Mr Kirilov’s report. Nevertheless, as Chair of Parliament’s Work Group on the European Social Fund, I am indignant at how long the review procedure that is currently in progress has taken. The Commission’s initial proposal dates from June 2009. Even though the purpose of this review was to help Member States combat the economic and social crisis, it took the Council six months to reach an agreement. That is unacceptable. It is true that the legislative procedure has been modified along the way to give Parliament the same amount of power as the Council. However, as the elected representatives of the European Union, we cannot today justify these delays to the public. I will now make a brief digression to welcome the responsibility shown by Parliament in agreeing as far as possible on the Council’s position in order not to delay the procedure any further. However, I would like to express my disappointment once again. We need a European Union that can take swift decisions that have a real impact on the ground. Now let us turn to the future for a moment. The simplification measures proposed today to combat the economic crisis are positive, but I would like to add that they could have been even more ambitious if the measures being applied to the current programming period, 2007-2013, had not been so clumsy and complicated. Therefore, looking ahead to the negotiations for the multiannual legislative framework for 2014-2020, I call on the European Parliament to demonstrate boldness in its proposals for the simplification of the administration and application of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the new online problem-solving network concerning cases of misapplication of internal market law, known as SOLVIT, is a very successful system insofar as it provides redress, without formal procedures, within approximately 10 weeks. Created in 2002, this network saw its workload increase by 22% in 2008. Even though the resolution rate remains quite high at 83%, the number of cases resolved is decreasing. It would seem to be time, eight years after it was created, to think about strengthening this institution by giving it the means to function effectively. These new measures would make it possible to help European citizens and businesses to assert their rights, especially with regard to the recognition of qualifications and of their social and residence entitlements. I therefore support the idea that not only should there be more SOLVIT staff in the Member States, but also that support and training measures should be put in place so that staff can function as efficiently as possible. It seems essential to me that governments and we ourselves, as elected representatives for our respective constituencies, should promote the SOLVIT network, which enabled cost savings of EUR 32.6 million in 2008. Furthermore, promoting this new tool would limit excessive recourse to the judicial system. I therefore call on the Member States to transpose all the European directives and make citizens and businesses aware of their rights within the internal market through national forms of media and information campaigns. To conclude, on behalf of my political group within the Committee on Petitions, I hope that cooperation between SOLVIT and our parliamentary committee will be strengthened so as to facilitate the work of these two bodies.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done, and our fellow Members for their hard work in creating this new microfinance instrument. This European instrument will make it possible to grant micro-credits to small enterprises and to people who have lost their jobs and want to set up their own small businesses. In this time of financial crisis, the most vulnerable people, especially the unemployed and young people, have been the worst affected. In fact, over 3.5 million job losses have been recorded this year in the European Union. The adoption of this new tool will make it easier for these people to access the capital required to set up or develop a business and make their dreams of entrepreneurship come true. We should not forget that over a third of micro-enterprises are created by unemployed people. In my region, I am often approached by citizens wishing to obtain aid to set up their own business. I am convinced that this new initiative will bear fruit in preserving jobs and that it will create new jobs too. The proposal will facilitate investments of low sums and will give micro-enterprises an opportunity to grow. Madam President, I would like to welcome the real added value of micro-credits, which will go hand in hand with new support measures, such as training and mentoring, which will enable the youngest people and the unemployed to obtain guarantees and assistance for their investment plans. I hope that this new instrument to promote employment will be adopted as soon as possible and that an agreement will be reached between Parliament and the Council on making this tool, which is vital for our fellow citizens, and particularly so during this crisis period, a permanent one. Ladies and gentlemen, let us not forget that it is small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every day in Europe, one in five women is a victim of violence. Violence against women is unacceptable, irrespective of the form it takes. Yet, in Europe, many women and young girls continue to live in the shadow of aggression or exploitation. The figures are alarming. Violence against women comes in many forms and occurs everywhere: domestic violence at home, sexual abuse, sexual harassment at work, rape, including within relationships, and also as a tactic of warfare outside Europe. In Europe, domestic violence is the main cause of death and disability among women between the ages of 16 and 44. As we debate these extremely serious matters, women are being assaulted. Talking about it is not enough. It is time for action. The European Union has a duty to protect its most vulnerable citizens. Fighting violence against women is a battle for fundamental human rights, and the Daphne Programme, which supports actions aimed at combating all forms of violence, is insufficient. New measures must be considered for the development of consistent European plans. I support the initiative of organising a European Year to combat violence against women, which our institution has been calling for now for more than a decade. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will not repeat all of the key points made by my fellow Members in relation to justice and immigration, but I did wish to point out that a European judicial area can only be established by enhancing mutual confidence among Member States, since that will improve the principle of mutual recognition, the cornerstone of the Europe of justice. Considerable progress has been made over the last 15 years, but there are still many weaknesses. I am delighted that the Treaty of Lisbon was finally ratified by all of the Member States during the negotiation of this text. The European Parliament will be able to have an equal say with the Council on matters relating to justice and home affairs; democratic legitimacy will be increased for the benefit of the citizens. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, I should like to stress that far too many complaints are referred to the Committee on Petitions concerning barriers to the freedom of movement of citizens within the European Union itself. I would also mention the problems linked to the mutual recognition of qualifications and to the right to social welfare benefits, as well as discrimination problems. The recognition of same-sex marriages, on the other hand, is an area that comes under the jurisdiction of the Member States. The Union must respect this national competence. I call on the European Commission to publish its guidelines as soon as possible so as to help the Member States’ authorities effectively combat breaches of the principle of free movement. Citizens must be able to move freely and to make full use of their rights in this area without internal borders. I am delighted to see that, in the resolution, the European Union’s anti-drug strategy has a place in the creation of this European judicial area. However, I hope that the European Union will show more initiative in this regard. Why does the Union not equip itself with new weapons for combating this growing trend, which affects our children at an increasingly early age? They are the future. What are we doing to protect them? Let us finally show some sense of pragmatism in our institutions! That is what our fellow citizens expect from us. Pascale Gruny,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), to congratulate the rapporteur most sincerely on the work she has done and on the spirit of cooperation she has shown throughout the process of drafting this report. We are giving our verdict today on the annual report on the European Ombudsman’s activities, which was presented on 21 April. Appointed by the European Parliament, the Ombudsman gives us a formal account, via this report, of all the results of his inquiries into complaints concerning cases of maladministration within our European institutions and agencies. His role, which is of the utmost importance, represents an essential guarantee that the principles of transparency and good administration will be respected and therefore constitutes a genuine form of protection for our fellow citizens in cases of injustice, discrimination, abuses of power, outstanding responses and delayed information. Indeed, in this report we note the increasing number of complaints lodged with the Ombudsman. The majority concern the European Commission, the institution that, admittedly, comprises the largest number of officials, but essentially, they are cases of an alleged lack of transparency. The fact remains that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. Coming back to the report, the Committee on Petitions approved it by a large majority on 1 October. Our Ombudsman has carried out his job of examining and processing the complaints in an active and balanced way. In particular, he has always been able to maintain good relations with and between the institutions, which has helped the institutions and agencies in question to accept an amicable solution or to settle certain disputes, with a few exceptions. Moreover, the Ombudsman serves as a resource for the institutions. He helps them to improve their performance by drawing their attention to areas for improvement, the ultimate goal being to improve the service to be provided to our fellow citizens. The report that we have adopted in committee underlines and points out the importance of the adoption of a code of good administrative behaviour by all of the European institutions and agencies, a code that was already approved by the European Parliament eight years ago. This repeated call by our committee must not remain unanswered. Europeans deserve nothing less. The right to good administration by the institutions and bodies of the European Union is a fundamental right laid down in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union included in Part II of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is no longer a fantasy but a reality. Lastly, I feel the need to point out that the Ombudsman reserves the right to scrutinise the work of the Commission and must ensure that the latter makes proper use of its discretionary power to start infringement proceedings or to propose sanctions.

The state of the dairy market has worsened considerably over the last 12 months: the price of milk has fallen by 30% in a year, which is the sharpest fall seen in the last 20 years. We therefore urgently need to introduce new forms of regulation at European level to ensure that the dairy sector is not just dependent on the rules of the market but can actually prove a match for them. Currently, the instability in producers’ incomes does not allow the best allocation to be made of resources that are vital for future investments in the sector. Therefore, the European Commission has a duty to facilitate contractual relations within the agri-food chain, so as to balance the relations between the various operators in the sector, stabilise the markets and prevent market risks. It must also encourage better organisation within the sectors. In addition, consideration should be given to whether an increase in milk quotas might have a positive impact on producer prices. Europe must act now. We can wait no longer. If we do not act, we will run the risk of seeing the European dairy sector suffer lasting damage, thus depriving our fragile rural areas of the hub of their economies.Arnaud Danjean,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to list today all of the crises and threats that affect our security and the stability of our continent and its neighbours. Every day – as we have just heard – we hear new reasons that lead us to believe that this multipolar world at the start of the 21st
 century is in many regards more dangerous than the world we had become used to because it is less predictable and less organised: civil war in Syria, Israeli-Arab tensions, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, clashes and crime in the Sahel, piracy off the coast of Somalia and continued fighting in Congo, to list just today’s dangers. In light of this situation, it would be irresponsible to think of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) as a luxury or a bit of an aside. It is a policy that is undoubtedly recent and still being formed. More than any other policy at EU level, it is a policy that is based on the Member States, on their material and human capacities, on their traditions and on their political desire to share, or not, as the case may be, their almost absolute sovereignty in diplomatic and military matters. This leads too many observers – and too many Members here – to believe that the CSDP is negligible or a pointless illusion. On the contrary, we believe – without any naivety or excess illusions – that the CSDP is a strategic necessity for the European Union. That is also why it appears in full in the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Union simply cannot continue just to systematically delegate its security and that of its neighbours. Of course, NATO, which brings together 21 of the 27 Member States, is still the cornerstone of the continent’s common defence, and we should be pleased about that. In addition, we must reaffirm the transatlantic partnership, which is irreplaceable, but it does not exclude efforts and ambitions on the part of the European countries themselves; on the contrary. Indeed, the United States, which has begun a real strategic shift towards Asia and the Pacific is calling on us in Europe to be more active, more robust, more sure of ourselves when it comes to security and defence. Those who call into question the CSDP and say that it duplicates work must realise that it offers pragmatic and intelligent complementarity when it comes to NATO, a military organisation, and the European Union. There are some crises that affect our security and in which NATO cannot intervene; Georgia was one example, and the same applies generally to the African conflicts, where the United States does not feel obliged to intervene, as we saw with the recent example of Libya. Unfortunately, these examples could increase in the future. Action by the European Union is often completely legitimate because its actions comply fully with international law, and there are few third countries that do not acknowledge its balanced role without any ambiguous, unilateral ambitions. It has many ways to act; it has the excellent civilian/military global approach and it is the only body to have this. All too often, unfortunately, what we are missing is political will – above all, on the part of the Member States: a lack of political will – and we have to emphasise this, too – or motivation on the part of certain Brussels institutions that are in charge of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the CSDP, a lack of vision at times, a reluctance to act in the Council, an ideological reluctance because we believe that soft power is more effective that the use of an armed force, and an absence of clear priorities that, too often, give the impression that we are making it up as we go along. The strategic challenges that we face are enormous and unprecedented: a structural and sustainable reduction in the defence budgets of European countries, the reorientation of US priorities, volatility and an extremely diverse range of threats. Therefore, the Member States either have to undergo a major and collective strategic downgrade, or pick themselves up and exploit as best they can, the potential of the CSDP, modest as it still may be. There is no doubt that most of our efforts today should focus on capacity-building, and in this regard we emphasise in the report the virtues of the pooling and sharing initiative promoted by the European Defence Agency, which is a step in the right direction. The economic and strategic crises must not be used as an excuse – and this is important, Mr President – to turn our backs, but should instead be an opportunity to strengthen our common ambition. (Applause) Arnaud Danjean,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, I would like to thank all of my colleagues who were involved in the preparation of this report in all of their groups. It is very pleasing to see such a broad consensus that the European Union has to equip itself with the means to achieve a global, international ambition, including a security and defence policy. Like the Minister, I am sorry that our British colleagues still have a very ideological and completely unpragmatic position, which is reflected in their actions. They have spoken here as the representatives of a great military nation, but they should not be under any illusions. That great military nation is also going to suffer, and is already suffering, a considerable strategic decline, with defence budget cuts, and problems with materials and human resources, like all European countries. Of course, NATO is our last resource, but NATO will not be able to intervene always and everywhere to defend European interests. Some Member States are not members of NATO. Some NATO countries will not always be prepared to defend European interests. We have to face up to that possibility. The European Union must therefore maintain a form of autonomy, which is not rivalry, competition or duplication, but intelligent complementarity. That is already the case across all of the European Union’s missions: more than a dozen missions are being carried out successfully today and are expected – and this is the most important aspect – by the countries that are in crisis. They recognise the European Union’s legitimacy and, undoubtedly, they would not be prepared to do that for any other international actor. We must be proud of that and we must restate this ambition. I hope that the relatively strong vote tomorrow in favour of this report will help the High Representative and the Council to forge ahead. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, the free and exemplary elections that took place in Georgia, which we had the privilege of observing with some of our colleagues, have resulted in democratic change in that country, which is a great privilege in the region.  The irony, of course, is that those who won the election, and we must congratulate them, are also those who during the campaign complained about a dictatorship run by criminals. We can only hope now that these new leaders will be somewhat wiser and reasonable in government than they were at times during the campaign. The European Union – as you did so successfully during your first trip to Tbilisi, it has to be said – must, without any paranoia or naivety, pay close attention to what happens in Georgia and judge the new authorities on their actions and their results, not just their declared intentions. It must also remain vigilant and remind those authorities that a change is not the same as revenge. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, we are all aware of the extent of your task and the difficulties involved in coordinating the Member States, which are highly sensitive about their diplomatic and military prerogatives. That requires us to be somewhat lenient and to recognise willingly that you do not spare any efforts. Nevertheless, it is impossible for us today not to express a degree of disappointment or even frustration, and this is clearly expressed in the Brok report, which underlines the lack of any clear sense of strategic priorities for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). Your commendable objective is the implementation of the comprehensive approach, which should give the European Union added value on the international stage. However, I must admit that the approach seems, above all, to be global in its dimension and, I was going to say, in its geographical scope. If we want to be everywhere, all the time, one sometimes wonders what the European Union actually does and where it really exercises successful global capabilities. You rightly mentioned the Horn of Africa; it is true that the EU is putting all of its resources, including its military resources, to work there, and it is still a success, but a limited success. The CFSP really has to get away from the fragmented, divided initiatives that take shape in response to emergencies and new situations and which concentrate on a hierarchy of priorities and truly coherent mobilisation of all of its instruments.

Mr President, I must say I am quite surprised to see Georgia being discussed today. Sure, as has been pointed out, there are visits by eminent public figures. Sure, there are elections to be held in October. However, this is not the only country where there are important visits and elections. We all know why we are talking about Georgia today. We are talking about Georgia today because a certain oligarch has decided to take part in the elections – which is his right - and because he has flooded the coffers of lobbyists in Washington and Brussels with dollars and euros, which has obviously paid off as we have placed Georgia on our agenda, not to talk about the Russian occupation, or about Russia’s violation of cease-fire agreements or about Russian military manoeuvres during October, in the midst of elections, but about the electoral process in Georgia. You have pointed out a number of resolutions in which we voted for an independent civil society, for a strong and credible opposition. An oligarch’s millions of dollars do not make a strong and credible opposition, nor do they create an independent civil society. Of course, we should not be giving a blank cheque to Mr Saakashvili. Yet I think that giving a blank cheque to this oligarch who has gone into politics is much more dangerous. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the resolution on the upcoming presidential elections in Russia, to be held on 4 March 2012, and on the controversial outcome of the legislative elections of 4 December 2011. With this text, we wanted to condemn the lack of transparency and impartiality of the Russian electoral system, prone to multiple cases of fraud, the lack of neutrality of the media, and the convergence of the state and the governing party. The aim of this resolution is therefore to express the EU’s concerns with regard to the situation of human rights and the rule of law in Russia. We urge Russia to hold free and democratic elections, and to punish those responsible for all forms of fraud and intimidation. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 I supported and participated in the drafting of this resolution in order to respond quickly to an unprecedented deterioration of the situation in Syria.

 I voted in favour of maintaining the funds of the European Programme of food aid for the most deprived (PEAD) for two additional years (2012 and 2013). Indeed, it is our responsibility to ensure the survival of such a programme, which has helped more than 18 million deprived people in 19 Member States of the European Union since 1987 (under the CAP). This programme will therefore continue to supply food to numerous charities working to eradicate hunger, with an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million. At present, our new fight, in which I wish to be fully engaged, is to ensure the long-term sustainability of this important solidarity programme by guaranteeing its funding beyond 2013.

 I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation on contractual relations in the milk sector. In effect, the report is, largely, a response to the terrible crisis that afflicted the milk sector in 2008-2010, when prices paid to producers collapsed dramatically. Furthermore, it looks to prepare dairy producers for the expiry of dairy quotas in 2015. In this way, it aims to increase the bargaining power of dairy producers in order to ensure that they receive fairer prices for their products, without encroaching on the right to competition. In order to do this, the new regulation permits, amongst others things, dairy producers to be able to join producer organisations so that they can gain real clout against processors as well as ensuring fairer distribution of added value along the supply chain. In the long term, this approach aims to provide a fairer standard of living for dairy producers. Today, therefore, I urge dairy producers to fully embrace the new tools established by European legislation, so that they may help further their interests, find their place in the market and prepare themselves for the ‘post-quota era’. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Mr President, the situation in Syria is currently the most serious and painful challenge facing the international community. Bombarding your own people with heavy artillery, imprisoning and torturing civilians, including children: these are things that we cannot tolerate and which bear witness to the blindness of a criminal regime. It is easy to become indignant and to condemn; it is harder to act, and to act effectively. Once we exclude – properly I believe – the possibility of military intervention as in Libya, we should recognise that our scope for action is very limited. There are, however, ways to contribute to the further isolation of this regime, an isolation that is, as Mr Brok emphasised, without doubt, the most realistic way forward. First of all, sanctions, on which the EU has taken the lead. These must be reinforced as much as possible, and they are a useful course of action. In the key area of diplomacy, we must first condemn the unchallengeable Russian and Chinese vetoes and we must, above all, make these countries realise that such vetoes are not only unacceptable, they are also incomprehensible and are a dead end for those countries themselves. The Arab League is taking initiatives; it is playing a major role which is to be welcomed and which ought to be supported and strengthened, even if all of the options that it presents are unrealisable in the short term. These initiatives have the immense merit of being in existence and of being widely adopted by responsible countries. Beyond the political need to apply maximum pressure on the Syrian regime and those who support it, like Iran and Russia, there is also a humanitarian emergency. The demand for unconditional, immediate access to the victims has no need of a UN resolution; it is an absolute moral duty. The EU and its Member States must bring all of their weight to bear to push forward the Arab League‘s initiatives and bring an end to the scandal of this repression from another age. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Mr President, the excellent report by our colleague, Mr Lisek, highlights the main constraint affecting national and multilateral defence efforts, now and in the future, namely, budgetary restraint. European countries will also be affected by another strategic constraint: the attitude of our US friends and allies, who are no longer willing or able to do everything for us where security is concerned. The Libyan case illustrated this point well. Therefore, in this very restrictive context, we must revive the ambition for a common security and defence policy which is strong on operations and capabilities. In terms of operations, Baroness Ashton, you talk at length – and rightly so – about this famous comprehensive approach that undoubtedly only the European Union has the power to promote in terms of the main international crises. We still need to ensure – and this is your role – that this comprehensive approach does not sacrifice security elements and, where appropriate, military elements. It must be truly comprehensive, without watering down this security aspect. That is the positive message you have given us through the Sahel and Horn of Africa strategies, and I welcome it. In terms of capabilities, we must, of course, welcome the European Defence Agency’s role, even if there are unfortunately still some restrictions on its budget. I would be grateful if you could make your assessment of the European Defence Agency’s efforts known. When talking about the defence industry, we must also remember that strengthening and supporting our European defence industries – obviously without forgetting to rationalise them – also supports jobs and technologies that extend far beyond the defence sector alone and which are of huge strategic importance to our economies, particularly during times of crisis. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Madam President, I hope that the resolution on Libya that we will be voting on tomorrow, and on which there is broad agreement, will be just as relevant as the resolution that we approved here six months ago, where the bulk of the provisions have proved perfectly reasonable. The condemnation and sanctions aimed at the Gaddafi regime, the introduction of the principle of the duty to protect civilian populations, if necessary through recourse to military force, and the recognition of the legitimacy of the National Transitional Council: all of these provisions were approved here before they were ever discussed in the European Council or implemented by the Member States. They form the backbone of the action taken by the international community. We should honour all those countries, particularly the European countries, of which there are many, that have been steadfastly committed to supporting the Libyan people’s desire for freedom through both diplomatic and military means. I feel that it is also important to pay tribute to the French pilots who, on 19 March, wiped out the columns of Colonel Gaddafi’s troops that were marching on Benghazi, thereby preventing the town from being added to the roll-call of ravaged towns mourned by Europe, such as Vukovar and Srebrenica. Six months on, obviously we need to avoid unwarranted optimism, because although Colonel Gaddafi’s reign has come to an end, the conflict itself has not, and also because the challenges associated with the embryonic transition are massive and far from resolved. The European Union therefore needs to act now by taking a leading role in this delicate phase. We need to work with other international players to offer prompt assistance and support that go beyond the humanitarian efforts that have already been made and that focus primarily on supporting civil movements, establishing institutions and organising the security sector. First and foremost, these concerted efforts must be based on one clear principle, namely that this transition must be guided by the Libyans themselves and that no one, albeit with the best intentions in the world, can take the place of the Libyan people’s hopes for independence.

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, on behalf of the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to congratulate you on your presentation of this very ambitious programme. You mentioned, with good reason, the external crises and the need to ensure the security and defence of the European Union, and were right to do so. While the Libyan crisis has, unfortunately, once again reminded us of and illustrated the difficulties the European Union faces in existing as such, in the international arena, we are pleased that the Polish Presidency has the courage to take on this debate. It should be emphatically noted that the common security and defence policy is not a secondary option, but rather it is a necessity. It is, firstly, an aim which is enshrined in the Treaty and is thus binding on the Member States and European institutions. It is also a strategic necessity; every day, with all the crises and threats all around us, we are finding that our US friends and allies cannot and do not want to do everything on our behalf. Lastly, it is an economic imperative at a time of budgetary restraint. Defence has a cost which many of our citizens consider exorbitant. To maintain our defence capabilities, as well as our industries, our expertise and our jobs, we must collectively streamline our defence budgets. The Member States must accept their responsibilities, but the European Union institutions – and I am thinking here of the High Representative and the External Action Service – should function more as a source of initiatives, and we are counting on the Polish Presidency to stimulate these initiatives. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the Libyan crisis has, unfortunately, once again illustrated the European Union’s difficulties in existing diplomatically and militarily. However, it would be most unfair to blame you solely for the lack of political will displayed by the Union, even if many of us believe that more decisive action could have been and should have been taken. It is also true that the Member States bear a great deal of responsibility for this inability to come up with a coherent, effective and visible policy on this matter, while our US friends relied heavily on Europe to act. The Libyan crisis aside, however, we must be mindful of the major strategic developments that mean that we must not give up on the ambition of a common security and defence policy, as enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, and which you, Baroness Ashton, must continue to inspire, support and speak up for. Taken together, the unprecedented fiscal constraints on defence budgets, the many international crises and the United States’ strategic redeployment are significant factors that leave us no choice but to take our destiny into our own hands. Faced with these many crises and threats, we cannot just hand over the keys to our US friends and allies or to NATO. Neither the United States nor NATO was able to end the 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia, for example, and nor can the United States or NATO observe the current ceasefire there. It is the European mission that has full legitimacy. We can clearly see in Libya that the United States did not want to be in the front line and that NATO’s minimum undertaking is insufficient. Baroness Ashton, the common security and defence policy is not just something achieved over 10 years or just an ambition enshrined in the Treaties. It is also a strategic requirement, and you must be at the forefront taking the necessary initiatives. (Applause) Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you emphasised – and we are all aware of this – the urgent need to take action in response to the Libyan crisis. You rightly pointed out what the European Union has done and has done rather well in humanitarian terms and in terms of the evacuation of European citizens. Indeed, I think that the European Union would have gained from publicising these actions and making them much more visible, because people too often have the impression that the Member States alone carry out these operations, whereas you have pointed out that European mechanisms have worked here. On a political and military level now, a reminder of the need for a no-fly zone is certainly necessary, if not just politically, then also militarily. It will take more than that, however, because – let us not forget – no-fly zones did not prevent atrocities on the ground in Bosnia and Kosovo, even when, in the case of overflying, they were applied very rigorously. While we await the UN Security Council’s decisions, we have European common security and defence policy instruments. We can implement them for the purposes of maritime surveillance, monitoring the embargo and delivering humanitarian aid. Europe has to make its voice heard on this point, and you have the instruments with which to act. Arnaud Danjean,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the subject we are dealing with today is one that we ought to have begun looking at many months ago, given that the security situation in the Sahel region has been steadily deteriorating for over three years now. Furthermore, we are dealing with the subject in a week in which we in France have buried two innocent young victims of Islamic terrorism, who were killed on the Niger-Mali border a few weeks ago. Aside from the intense feelings that these crimes arouse, we need to recognise the real threats concentrated in this region on Europe’s doorstep, as the threat is not only from terrorism, even though the kidnappings and murders are the most dramatic manifestation of the deteriorating situation in Mauritania, Mali and Niger. Criminal networks are rife. Trafficking in drugs, arms and human beings is threatening the stability of these countries, but also that of our own continent. For make no mistake, in the same way that the majority of the victims of the terrorist acts in this region are European citizens, Europe is also the destination for this trafficking. In the face of this extremely worrying situation, the European Union should put in place an integrated, comprehensive strategy to combine its development and security policies. This is absolutely vital. There are initiatives already in place of course, via the tenth European Development Fund (EDF) in particular, and almost EUR 2 billion have been set aside for these countries for combating poverty, developing the economy and establishing more effective governance. Certain Member States have bilateral cooperation policies, too, of course. However, we now need to go much further. In particular, our action needs to be much more coordinated. We need to strengthen the regional approach and encourage these countries to work together more to deal with the common challenges they face. We also need to expand the range of policies at the EU’s disposal and integrate them as much as possible, in the areas of development, security, strengthening institutional structures, customs, the courts and the police. Baroness Ashton, there are few regions so close to Europe that harbour so many threats to our security and there are few regions in which the EU can at last put into practice the integrated approach envisaged in the Treaty of Lisbon, on the basis of which the European External Action Service which you currently head was formed. Baroness Ashton, please can you give us some details about the strategy that you intend to implement in this region? Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Madam President, to correct what has been said, Mr Arlacchi is quite right, the final text proposed to us no longer contains, in Recital B, the words ‘occupation force’. Quite simply, the translations, and particularly the French translation, were not correct in the latest version, and the French translation, until this morning, still contained the expression ‘occupation force’, hence the speech by my colleague Mr Juvin. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I share your opinion on the Lisbon Summit which has come up with a new strategic concept which is satisfactory overall. However, we should nonetheless recognise, in all honesty, that the poor relation of this text is, in view of the potential of this strategic partnership, the European Union-NATO relationship, which should be a great deal more ambitious. You rightly noted the successes and progress of capability development. You noted successes, obviously, in the case of Afghanistan, where we are managing to reach compromises on the ground. However, it is unsatisfactory that we do not have a structured political dialogue with NATO, apart from the single case of Bosnia We all know that the problem is that of Turkey. We are going to have to deal with it seriously, no doubt pragmatically, and I hope that the efforts you are making with Secretary General Rasmussen will bear fruit. I briefly want to say that the problem of duplication is often advanced to highlight the weaknesses of the European Union and to limit the European Union’s aspiration to be ambitious. This is a false problem because there are not two armies in our Member States, a NATO army and a European Union army. There is an armed force in each country and it is up to the country to choose whether to place its troops under the NATO banner or the European Union banner. Let us stop scaremongering with this notion of duplication. I would like to say a word about complementarity: it is essential and must be applied intelligently. I would not want to see complementarity becoming an imperative with the European Union becoming the Red Cross of what would be a NATO armed force. The European Union must keep its military capabilities, hold onto its military ambitions and must retain its ambition in the case of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) as was pointed out in the tripartite Franco-German and Polish letter. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
).

Mr President, I will make three brief points on this subject. Firstly, as the issue at stake was France’s position regarding the sale of the Mistral, may I remind you that no firm agreement has been reached, that the Mistral is a vessel, a ship that would be sold unarmed – which is really one of the fundamental issues at the heart of talks with Russia – and that Russia has not only entered into negotiations with France to purchase this type of equipment. So, allow me to put things into perspective. I realise that there is a great deal of emotion in some countries, but emotion is one thing, the facts are quite another. Secondly, as you pointed out, Minister, we have within the European Union a code of conduct for arms exports that became a common position under the French Presidency in 2008; this code of conduct is one of the most demanding in the world. We are above exemplary on the matter, and we have, in addition to this code of conduct, as one of our fellow Members reminded us, a group that meets on a regular basis as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy to discuss not only the implementation of this code but also Member States’ national policies on arms exports. There are, therefore, forums in which the Mistral issue can be dealt with quite adequately. Lastly, allow me to say that, if we are talking about European solidarity on arms exports and if we are looking at the need to have a common strategy and a common defence policy, we need to look at the entire cycle of trade in arms and defence equipment. That also involves imports and obviously the defence industry. From that point of view, I believe that many countries also have a long way to go to ensure that Europe can maintain technologies, jobs, know-how and a real strategic capacity in our military deployments. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I should like to express the unequivocal support of the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and our unequivocal support for the very fine compromise negotiated by Mr Brok, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Gualtieri. Indeed, this is an important milestone in the creation of a common European policy in areas as sensitive as foreign affairs, security and defence. Every day, from Georgia to the coasts of Somalia, from the Balkans to Gaza, we can clearly see how much this common policy is needed and also – I was going to say above all – how much our citizens want it. Because, above and beyond the interinstitutional powers which we are welcoming today in this compromise and, in particular, the increased role given to Parliament, we must clearly emphasise the strategic opportunity represented by this External Action Service, which is an essential tool for equipping the EU with a more ambitious, more consistent, more credible and more effective common foreign and security policy. Baroness Ashton, may I say to you, as Chair of Parliament’s Subcommittee on Security and Defence and also, to some extent, as a Frenchman, that I insist on the particular responsibility which you will have to exercise, that of crisis management, by preserving and strengthening the EU’s unique character and added value, in other words, its civil-military capabilities – the two words go together. You are the one who will be responsible for ensuring that the EU maintains and increases its capabilities by rejecting the ill-founded suspicions that are voiced here and there – and indeed sometimes in this Chamber – to the effect that the service will be militarised, and by joining with Parliament as much as possible in clearly affirming the legitimacy of any operations conducted by the EU in crisis locations. Arnaud Danjean,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy that we are presenting today is an annual document by Parliament that provides a kind of interim assessment of the European Security and Defence Policy and submits proposals aimed at improving the effectiveness and visibility of that policy. This year, this report lies within a very specific context, and thus it should become a force for proposals. This specific context is characterised by the combination of three major cycles. The first concerns the 10 years of the European Security and Defence Policy, which we celebrated at the end of 2009. The last 10 years showed that Europe was able to conduct civil and military operations at the scene of more than 23 crises. That fundamental achievement can be built on further. It shows that there is a demand for Europe and that the Union has the institutional­political and operational ability to rise to these challenges. The second important cycle is, of course – and Mr Albertini mentioned it a moment ago – the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. The change in terms of security and defence goes far beyond a strict semantic adjustment. Indeed, the ESDP becomes the Common Security and Defence Policy, the CSDP, and it must take on a new dimension. The Treaty has enriched the range of tools and the scope of security and defence policy, particularly with the inclusion of assistance clauses, of solidarity clauses, with permanent structured cooperation and, above all, with the creation of the European External Action Service and of your role as High Representative, Vice-President of the Commission. Lastly, the third major event that characterises the context in which this report was drafted is that NATO which, for 21 of the 27 members of the Union, is still the main reference point where the collective security of the European continent is concerned, is currently revising its strategic concept and that this assessment by NATO should also lead us, the Union, to define more clearly the conditions of this partnership, which remains fundamental. In this context, the report’s objective is less about persisting with a doctrine than about providing you with a necessarily evolving roadmap, for all the new institutions that are being established and that must learn to work together. The aim is to make the Union more credible, more effective and more visible in security and defence terms. In this regard, the European Parliament absolutely must be given a greater degree of responsibility in these sensitive areas if a policy of which the main aim is to guarantee the security of European citizens is to be fully legitimate. With this report, we wanted to stress the following points. Firstly, we wanted to point out that, above all, the European Security and Defence Strategy and the Common Security and Defence Policy are there to serve the people of Europe, to guarantee and improve their security. This political ambition is not superfluous; it is not for appearances’ sake. It corresponds to a need for our continent to strive to ensure its own security but also to contribute to the stability of the world around us, to tackle the crises and the threats that are developing in our environment. Beyond the traditional armed conflicts that continue to take place in our immediate environment, Europe must be able to express its interests and defend them in the face of the new threats – I am thinking in particular of piracy and cybercrime. We also felt it important to stress just how unequalled Europe’s added value in crisis management is, thanks to the variety of solutions it provides and the balance that it strikes in each of its operations between the civil and military dimensions. Moreover, in this regard, I reject the criticisms that some may direct at the Union’s security and defence policy, namely to suggest that it is all about militarisation. I sincerely believe in the complementary nature of the civil and military instruments that the Union possesses, and the recent crisis in Haiti, where you went – and I believe that you were able to observe this good cooperation – testifies to the need to link our civil and military resources so that we can cope with natural disasters and major crises. Precisely on the subject of these operations, we were anxious to review them all, to highlight what we feel are their strengths, but also, at times, their weaknesses – they have to be acknowledged so that things can improve. We were also anxious to highlight several regions of strategic importance for the security of the Union and to encourage the Council and the Commission to speed up the implementation of global strategies, in particular, for the Horn of Africa and for the Afghanistan­Pakistan region. In the area of capabilities – both civil and military – which is a crucial issue in terms of the credibility of our policy, the challenge is to improve the Union’s responsiveness. We have to be able to mobilise more quickly and more effectively the material resources and the competent personnel that the Member States have at their disposal. However, we also have to have the capability, by means of a security and defence industry that is efficient, that combines invaluable technological knowledge and that also accounts for hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe, to provide ourselves with equipment programmes corresponding to these forecasted needs. The Europe of industry and defence has begun to organise itself on our continent through the defence package. Issues relating to industrial and trade cooperation with third countries should be addressed quickly, particularly in the light of the recent problems encountered by European industries trying to access the US market, for example. This is a brief, inevitably overly brief, summary of the priorities that appear in this report and which represent all the challenges that you will have to take up. Parliament is ready to play its full role, its full positive and constructive role, to help you realise this ambition, which is a common ambition. Moreover, I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank all the political groups that have worked hard to enrich this report. We have all cooperated very well together to maintain a high level of ambition, while taking account, of course, of the characteristics of each of our groups. I would also take advantage of this opportunity, Baroness Ashton, to address with you today the issue of non­proliferation. On the eve of the Non­Proliferation Treaty review conference, to be held in May, the European Parliament wished to review with you the Union’s commitment in relation to the fight against proliferation, and to the control of arms and disarmament; this is the meaning behind the oral questions that have been put to you and which you will answer shortly. The international context seems to offer new opportunities on the eve of this review conference. Firstly, President Obama has strongly affirmed his ambition to have a world without nuclear weapons and his commitment to actively seek the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear­Test­Ban Treaty by the United States. Secondly, the conclusion with Russia of a new agreement designed to supersede the START Agreement seems to be going well and, lastly, we have the launch of the negotiations on a new disarmament treaty that would prohibit the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. With regard to the reduction in nuclear arsenals, the priority is obviously to reduce the two main arsenals, that is, those of Russia and the United States, which it is commonly believed still alone hold nearly 95% of all the nuclear weapons that exist on the planet. We therefore welcome the commitment made by Presidents Medvedev and Obama to conclude a new reduction agreement in the near future. How does the Union, in this context, envisage supporting these efforts and cooperating with the United States and Russia? The Union must also rise to the challenges posed to the non­proliferation regime and, more specifically, to those with which we are confronted by the two major proliferation crises that are Iran and North Korea, which remain the main threats to international security. Will the Union continue to commit itself effectively, completely, to resolving these crises, particularly in the case of Iran? We expect your guidance on this major issue, Baroness Ashton. Moreover, the Union has a role to play in promoting cooperation relating to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. You know that this is an important challenge. What actions are being carried out in this context, and what is your strategy on the matter? Lastly, the European Parliament wants the Union to be a proactive force during the forthcoming Non­Proliferation Treaty review conference. The adoption of a new ambitious and balanced common position by the Union is crucial if the latter is to defend its position. Where do the Member States stand in this regard? Arnaud Danjean,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all the speeches which, once again, have helped to enrich the debate, to enrich this report. I would like to reassure those who have voiced their doubts and, at times, their suspicions, about the fact that this report might open the door to more competition, with NATO in particular, and even to isolation. This is by no means the case; I absolutely do not believe that, and I would add that this does not appear in the treaty, quite the opposite. You can believe a French MEP who has fought tirelessly to have his country reinstated within the integrated structures of NATO. When we talk about strategic autonomy, what idea are we developing, what policy have we been developing, for 10 years? The answer is the ability of the European Union to intervene via civil and military missions in areas in which other organisations, including NATO, cannot. NATO could not have intervened to put a stop to the conflict in Georgia, where there is no UN or OSCE presence. NATO intervened no earlier than we did in the Horn of Africa to put a stop to events threatening our security interests. Strategic autonomy also means the ability to intervene with a range of instruments that we alone possess: civil and military instruments, legal instruments, financial instruments, development instruments. The European Union is best placed to develop this global approach in crisis areas. Our strategic autonomy also refers to our ability, where necessary, not to intervene, either in unilateral military campaigns, or – and this has been pointed out by several Austrian Members – because there are neutral countries among us and because we respect their status. This is what is meant by European defence and security. This is what is meant by the strategic autonomy that we are developing by means of this policy. Never forget the origins of this European Security and Defence Policy. It originates in a tragic, bloody failure: that of the Balkans in the 1990s, where the European Union was incapable of coping with a major security challenge on its own continent. Let us not forget that. Our European citizens have not forgotten it, and they would not forgive us if we abandoned the ambition to see Europe play a role on the international stage. (Applause) Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Mr President, Mrs Ashton, the events on Ashura Day and the bloody repression of the recent demonstrations in Iran have shown that it was a total mistake to make a very artificial distinction between the hardening of the regime internally and the inflexible policy that it pursues externally, in particular, on the Iranian nuclear issue. Consequently, the prospect of additional sanctions seems inevitable, or even desirable. I would like to know your point of view on the timetable and the nature of possible sanctions precisely so that we can make a clear link between the internal events in Iran and the nuclear issue. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE
).

Madam President, Mrs Ashton, you were right to stress that the important thing in Yemen in terms of security priority is to end the internal conflicts that exist in that country. We must not confuse the causes and the consequences, and without playing down the terrorist risk, the main reason for the instability in Yemen is not terrorism. Terrorism develops because there is instability due to internal conflicts. From this point of view, the priority of the European Union should be to encourage and to support the efforts currently being made to start a national dialogue in Yemen with President Saleh. At regional level, there are – as we have just been reminded – links with the Somalian crisis and the crisis in the Horn of Africa. There are very sizeable migratory flows, but also arms trafficking and movement of jihadist fighters between Yemen and Somalia. In this respect, I would like to know where the European Union stands as regards the strengthening of maritime surveillance capacities, which also concern Yemen. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Madam President, much has been said about the action plan on Afghanistan. Speaking for myself, I regret that the presentations given to us today did not place slightly more emphasis on the link between the EUPOL mission and the NATO mission in Afghanistan. This is a mission that we must carry out. The quantitative and qualitative problems that it is encountering are mainly due to the link with NATO and, in order to be effective, we must solve them as quickly as possible. I would have liked more to have been said about this. My question concerns Pakistan, the chronic instability of which is, as we all know, a factor in the crisis for the entire region and for Afghanistan, too. I see, in the action plan, that cooperation with Pakistan is envisaged in the areas of counter-terrorism and security. In that country there is, as we know, a significant ideological and sometimes structural and organisational connection between radical Islamic movements that operate in Kashmir and at the Afghan border. I wanted to be sure that the methods, the nature and the timeframe of the assistance that we envisage are gauged properly, in order to prevent this connection from having extremely adverse and harmful effects. Arnaud Danjean  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, you rightly pointed out that the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon was going to enable us to enter a new era of enlargement policy, and we have to embark on this new process with realism and a clear head: that is the essence of this resolution. On the one hand, a new process does not mean going for broke. That would be the surest way of creating misunderstandings, even suspicion, among the public, and it would also be the best way of creating false ideas among the candidate countries and of encouraging them to take refuge in rhetorical and cosmetic policies rather than in policies aimed at more thorough reforms. We must be wary of steps, conditions and values on which we cannot compromise, and I believe in particular in cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal. On the other hand, it must be reaffirmed, in the clearest of terms, that the place of the western Balkans, of all the countries of the western Balkans, including Kosovo, is indeed in the European Union, and that we must encourage them to continue and to increase their efforts. There is no contradiction between making the demands clear, on the one hand, and showing full support for the process of enlargement to include the western Balkans, on the other, just as there is no contradiction between pursuing this philosophy of judging everyone on merit and having to take important initiatives for all of the countries in the region, such as visa liberalisation. Finally, allow me to say a word about Turkey. Before speculating on any very hypothetical future outcome concerning Turkey’s accession process, I will simply say that the Commission has noted, for the second year running, that no progress was made on the Ankara Protocol and that that prevented any new negotiating chapters from being opened. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, what I have to say has been said many times over by my fellow Members. At a time when Europe is considering a common strategy for its supply of raw materials and especially rare earths, we cannot overlook the huge potential that the intelligent recovery of our waste offers. Strengthening European standards so as to improve the functioning of the collection chain, solving problems relating to the leakage and illegal export of WEEE, and setting more ambitious collection targets: that is what should be at the heart of this legislation. Let us not forget who is chiefly responsible for the success or failure of this legislation: the consumer. Empowering the public is crucial if we want to implement effective legislation. To this end, Mr Florenz, the eco-contribution, among other systems, has proved to be a very important tool. Of course, electrical and electronic equipment producers must become more involved in the collection and recycling system, but we cannot absolve the citizens of all responsibility for the waste they produce. Our citizens must become actors and not spectators in European environmental policy. Catherine Soullie  (PPE
).

Madam President, Christians are, without doubt, one of the most persecuted religious groups in the world. In the Middle East, they are seen by some extremist groups as – I quote – ‘legitimate targets’, and the end goal is their departure, pure and simple, from this region, a region which saw the birth of Christianity, and a region in which their historical presence is essential for a certain kind of balance. The events in the Baghdad cathedral are merely the culmination of a situation that we have been observing passively for far too long. The European Union, as a global player and a business partner of various countries in this region, must strongly express its indignation with regard to this situation. Discrimination, of whatever kind, cannot be tolerated. Democracy will only be victorious in this region when the most fundamental human rights, such as religious freedom, are respected.

 In adopting this resolution, the European Parliament, the voice of European citizens and democracy, is sending a clear message to the Chinese authorities: that eradicating and subjugating one culture to benefit another is an act that is not worthy of any truly great and modern country. The Tibetan people have a wholly legitimate request: that their history and language should be respected. Tibetan culture is not the only one threatened by this unreasonable decision – Cantonese and other languages will also fall victim to the policy of standardisation. Given that the Chinese Constitution specifically recognises each citizen’s right to express him/herself in his/her chosen language, how can the political authorities justify this legal U-turn? The European Union’s motto clearly sums up the message that we have a duty to pass on to the Chinese authorities through this resolution: united in diversity. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, union and realism will be on show, at least I should like that to be the case, tomorrow when we vote on our resolution for this Sixteenth Conference of the Parties on Climate Change. I therefore hope that our Commissioner in charge will be able to keep the pragmatic targets that we must meet collectively, but also to defend the absolutely non-negotiable associated conditions that Europe has set. Neither must we lose sight in these negotiations of the expectations that our fellow citizens and our industries have of a fair balance. It is the world that must fight climate change, and not Europe on its own. Therefore it will be essential to recognise the importance of intellectual property that is inadequately protected. Green technologies must be of benefit to the greatest number, but that does not mean that we must sell our current and future knowledge on the cheap, even for the sake of this vital battle against climate change. Similarly, to ask for common methods of calculating emissions as well as verification and publication of data so that all emitting industries are put on the same scale seems to be a most legitimate request and not a negotiating tactic. Finally, and my fellow Member raised this just now, more controversial are the loopholes in the current Clean Development Mechanism that are also to be put on the table. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all, regretfully, well aware that the real negotiating power does not lie with the European Parliament. However, the willingness of a number of MEPs, myself included, to work and to participate in a positive outcome of this conference must be encouraged and not neglected, as we have felt it to be in the last few days. If Europe wishes to be strong at the heart of international dialogues, so must all its lawmakers be likewise. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 The vote on Mrs Estrela’s report is vitally important. The position adopted is purely demagogic and irresponsible. By demanding 20 weeks of maternity leave, we are discrediting the European Parliament. We are the citizens’ voice; to adopt such unrealistic positions would not do justice to them. Very significant costs for the social budgets of Member States would be incurred: as regards France, for instance, the amount would be EUR 1.3 billion. The current economic situation does not allow us to absorb this kind of increase within state budgets, not to mention the consequences for our companies who will have to bear part of these additional costs. We need to support and encourage women to better reconcile maternity and work, not scupper their chances of finding a job. The increase from 14 to 18 weeks proposed by the Commission was a real step forward; a step that could have been built on by giving some thought to new childcare options. The message conveyed by this text carries huge responsibility: maternity would clearly become a barrier to personal development in the workplace. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Madam President, the scale of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is clearly such that it demands us EU political representatives to ask ourselves questions about the safety of our own oil installations. In fact, one of the keys to protecting the marine environment is to ensure that oil exploration sites are as safe as possible. Nevertheless, the idea of a moratorium on current and future oil drilling in our waters is clearly premature and inappropriate. Premature, because the outcome of the investigation into the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is not yet known, and some preliminary conclusions confirm that it was due to a combination of behavioural, organisational and technical errors. Inappropriate because − as has been said several times − different regulations apply in the North Sea, in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico. Is it worth pointing out here the serious economic and social consequences that a moratorium would have, not to mention how it might jeopardise our energy independence? Last week, Norway and Russia ended a 40-year dispute and a 30-year moratorium by confirming the principle of a common maritime border in the Barents Sea and the Arctic. This agreement will, in practice, result in the two countries sharing a hydrocarbon-rich area. How, then, could the EU executive at the same time plan to ask for these oil activities to be suspended and for them to voluntarily place themselves in a position of weakness from an energy and economic point of view?

Mr President, as our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, reminded us, biocidal products play an essential role, be it in the domestic – and hence private – sphere or in relation to public places. Biocides safeguard our hygiene and health on a daily basis. It is important that we achieve a coherent Community text. It needs to be coherent, first and foremost, with other European legislation. REACH legislation, for example, cannot and must not come into conflict with the regulation on biocides. It is important to avoid administrative and legislative red tape which strangles and suffocates our businesses. On this point, I should like to express my support for the compromise achieved by our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, on the thorny issue of exclusion criteria and candidates for substitution. Similarly, the frame formulation approach for all biocidal products is an essential element of the regulation. It will significantly increase the efficacy of the Community authorisation system. Then, it is a Community text. The introduction of the concept of centralised authorisation in the Union, and the simplification of the procedure and the reduction in the authorisation times for certain tests relating to research and development activities, are two initial positive steps towards the harmonisation of the European market in biocidal products. Finally, we must not lose sight of our ambitions for this text: protection, of course, but the construction of our Community market and European innovation must also be an integral part of our approach.

 I deeply regret the fact that Parliament has adopted the motion for a resolution tabled by the Socialists, Liberals, Greens and Communists regarding the situation of the Roma people in Europe. I feel it is unacceptable to criticise France in that way, since it is not the only Member State to return Roma to their own country. The establishment of certain Roma camps is clearly prejudicial to public order and sometimes even a violation of the right to private property, and the burden it places on our social security system entitles the French Government to take such measures in accordance with the provisions of the European Treaties. The returns to Romania and Bulgaria were carried out in accordance with French and European law and in strict compliance with human rights. I welcome the decision by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to set up a working group on Roma integration in order to find a European solution to the issue of nomadism. We need to take a constructive approach to this subject. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

I approve of the result of the vote on the text referring to the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. It may not be perfect, but the Jeggle report seems to me at least to offer a good compromise; a compromise, moreover, that has won the support of the Eurogroup for Animals. The wording allows us effectively to limit tests causing pain to animals, while avoiding a diversion of research, and hence also of innovation, outside the Union, with the resulting loss of many jobs. As Vice-President of the Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals, I am moreover convinced that it is more valuable to keep animal experimentation on our territory, where it is strictly regulated, than to leave it to third countries, where sanitary conditions and respect for animal life often leave much to be desired.

I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on this very sound text, which has been adopted by a large majority in this House. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Affairs on business registers, I should like to stress the importance of this report. The data on commerce within the European Union are crucial to the positive development and the growth of our single market, and I look forward to the Commission’s legislative proposals on this issue. Mandatory participation of all Member States in a common business register would benefit the entire Union. However, this is possible only if care is taken not to impose additional administrative burdens on our businesses and if private data are kept private, in order to maintain a climate of confidence.

 Mr President, the final agreement which has been reached on the recast of the directives on industrial emissions is more than acceptable, and I welcome the work done to reach a compromise. This final package takes up the key points of the position which I defended with several of my colleagues within the Committee on the Environment, and which was designed to make this text an ambitious, yet realistic, piece of legislation. First, a degree of flexibility is maintained for businesses and for the authorities responsible for granting exemptions. Next, I must applaud the new version of the ESN, which caused so much controversy and which seems much more achievable now that it has been restricted to certain sectors. It is also important to point out that, thanks to the agreement reached, there is a stronger link with the Emission Trading System (ETS) Directive, and the somewhat irrelevant notion of creating an SO2
 and NOx quotas market has been removed once and for all from the text of the new directive. A few reservations should, nevertheless, be borne in mind, and they relate more specifically to the provisions on soils. The Soil Directive is still pending, and unfortunately, this major issue will be addressed only by those Member States which have their own legislation. Tomorrow, Parliament has a duty to adopt the points of the agreement reached at the end of the trialogues. Huge efforts have been made by all concerned to prevent this text from being sent back to the conciliation stage. It is a text which, may I remind you, is crucially important for industry and European environmental policy alike. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

 I abstained from voting on the resolution on Israel’s boarding of the Mavi Marmara flotilla. I believe the resolution put forward unbalanced claims and an erroneous version of the facts. I think we need to await the results of the inquiry commission before trying to pass judgment on the Mavi Marmara incident. We must, of course, deplore the loss of human lives but, above all, we must analyse objectively and reasonably the decisions, actions and circumstances that led to this tragedy. Undoubtedly, Israel made political and military errors, but we should nevertheless remember that a naval blockade is a legitimate measure that is recognised by international law in the context of an armed conflict at sea. The blockade, which was put in place to stop arms trafficking in that region at war, was broken through and challenged by the same fleet which is now being presented to the world as the victim of an unjustified Israeli attack. Only a rational dialogue will enable negotiations between Israel and Gaza to move forward. In the framework of that dialogue, Europe is duty-bound to provide a calm, balanced view, without showing any undue partisan fervour. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

I am very pleased with the result of the vote on the Sommer report. The European Parliament has opted for a legible and informative labelling system that will favour balanced consumption patterns. Furthermore, I welcome the adoption of Amendment 205, which will allow for the inclusion of mandatory particulars for meat and meat products derived from animals that have not been stunned prior to slaughter. The consumer needs to be informed of respect for animal welfare practices, practices that are at the heart of European food policy. This is not about stigmatising religious communities or putting their meat production and distribution chain in difficulty, but simply about letting European citizens consume with full knowledge of the facts.

This report on progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals has developed into something that I was unable to support: I considered it was important to vote against the Cashman report as a whole, following the adoption of the second point of paragraph 42 of Mr Cashman’s draft report, which was put to the vote. The lack of clarity regarding the idea behind the expression ‘safe abortion’ was impossible to ignore. Abortion, although necessary in some exceptional circumstances, must not be regarded as a method of contraception. What is more, like all medical procedures, it is never without risk. We must not trivialise it. Development depends first and foremost on respect for life. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Reducing the Israeli­Palestinian conflict to a mere comparison of the number of deaths in one or the other warring camp can only distort our view of this war, which has been going on for too long now. We all agree that it is difficult to find a solution to this conflict, since the causes themselves are complex and deep­rooted. Thus, seeing things in purely black and white terms is impossible in this area of the world. The mission led by Judge Goldstone was tasked solely with listing the violations of international law. Although not all of the conclusions in this report are unjustifiable, voting against these resolutions, which approved the approach and the conclusions of a text that I believe has been managed in a biased fashion but, above all, on the basis of incomplete objectives, struck me as being the most honest intellectual solution. Yes, we do need to denounce and stop the abuses that are committed by one or the other of the warring parties in that region, but we need to be very careful with regard to the procedure used if we want the justice to be established in the region to lead us in the direction of a lasting peace.

Mr President, today there remains less than 15% of the original bluefin tuna stock. In the face of such figures, the solution seems obvious. Nevertheless, we should not forget about the jobs affected by the decision that we are discussing today. It should be pointed out that the aim of the CITES is not to prohibit fishing but merely the international trade in this type of fish, 80% of which is exported to Japan. By protecting tuna, we are certainly protecting an endangered species, but we are also encouraging the continuation of a more balanced and sustainable fishing activity, one that is destined for our internal market and which generates employment. I am in favour of the idea of listing bluefin tuna in Appendix I of the CITES and, while I believe that this decision will be positive, the help of the Commission will be crucial, since it will mean that the fisheries sector can be completely overhauled. My question therefore concerns the conditions of this support. France is requesting an 18-month extension accompanied by financial measures for those fishermen and ship-owners affected by a trade ban. What is the Commission’s view on the subject? Moreover, I, like many of my colleagues, am concerned about fairness. How can we guarantee that boats flying the flag of countries such as Tunisia, Libya and so on will apply the international trade ban as rigorously as we do? What will the new control and penalty measures consist of? Our policy of having sustainable economic activities has to be practical, and sometimes even unpopular in certain sectors, but I hope that the Commission and the Council do not lose sight of the adjustments needed in order to implement these measures.

 Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we no longer need to demonstrate the importance of the issue of climate change. Its short, medium and long-term impacts are undeniable, although the results from the JESC have made the front page of a certain national newspaper and will undoubtedly strengthen the sceptics’ position. The Copenhagen conference appeared to the world to be a unique opportunity for world leaders to bear witness to, act on and correct the effects of this process of climate change. The European Union was a key player at this forum, not only on account of the bold legislation we have passed to limit the impact of our activities on climate, but also because Europe represents a union of countries which can really make a difference. The outcome of the Copenhagen conference has obviously left a feeling of dissatisfaction, but I refuse to call it a failure. The world, including even one of the most reluctant countries, China, has agreed on the issue of limiting the increase in temperature to two degrees. Brazil has just passed a law aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by around 39% by 2020, in line with its undertakings. Many other countries also showed great ambition with regard to greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. I am thinking here of Japan and Norway. I must also highlight the very positive point that was the consensus achieved on the urgent need for a mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation. A specific and unanimous text was produced on the implementation of the so-called REDD+ mechanism to reduce deforestation and enable CO2
 to be stored naturally. Although far from a binding agreement, but clearly along the lines of a political agreement, the outcome of Copenhagen should lead us to question why it was such a disappointment. I attended the Copenhagen conference, as did a number of my fellow Members, with this desire to participate, to help and to see a Europe of negotiation and of leadership take action. I was hugely disappointed because Europe, and particularly Parliament, clearly did not play the role that it deserved to in the negotiations. To make its presence felt, Europe must be seen to be stronger in this area. The meeting of our environment ministers in Seville went nowhere, and our leaders were seen to be unsure and hesitant, and we are still divided over our targets. I hope that Mrs Hedegaard, armed with her proposals and the undertakings she gave before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, will be able to restore the ambitions of the European Union.

Freedom of the press is an absolute requirement. A democratic legislative institution like the European Parliament obviously cannot question this benefit. The protection and defence of freedom of information must be guaranteed in all circumstances. Nevertheless, the European Parliament does not have a duty to be a supranational court of justice. Pluralism and freedom of all media must be ensured in the European Union, but it does not behove us as MEPs to judge a country and its leaders on the nature of the relations between the press and the political world. Interference by the European Parliament in this area is unacceptable. What is our legitimacy for issuing any opinion whatsoever on the condition of the Italian media? This is an internal political debate of a Member State, a debate that must be held and resolved inside the frontiers of the State concerned. The rejection of the amendment which intended to change the name of this resolution to give it a more Community-orientated feel demonstrates the targeted and purely political nature of this debate. We must be careful we do not transform our assembly into a court. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Following the vote on the joint resolution on freedom of information in Italy and in the European Union as a whole, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is very satisfied. What we needed to do was to set out clearly the role of the European Parliament: we are a legislative assembly and not a tribunal on the internal affairs of the Member States. It would not have been appropriate for this disguised personal attack to have been supported by Parliament. I am very pleased with the outcome of the vote. Although it was very close, it re-establishes the value of the principle of subsidiarity within the European Union and its institutions. Catherine Soullie  (PPE

Providing aid to developing countries is one duty that the European Union must not abandon. The current economic and financial crisis has given a new dimension to globalisation. The idea of a tax on financial transactions was beneficial: President Sarkozy has made it one of his priorities. Europe, it seems, has set the pace and the world has followed. The new, sound workings of international finance will have to be based on fairness. Thus, I regret that the Striffler-Ponga amendment has been rejected, as it proposed a tax on financial transactions to be added to official development assistance, so that the least developed countries could benefit from it. It is true that our economies and our financial systems would have had a greater tax burden, but the European Union would thus have been the initiator of a great international solidarity movement. We can still hope that the resolution adopted here will encourage the Union to honour its commitments and to help developing countries keep pace with globalisation. Christophe Béchu  (PPE

Mr President, I would just like to say that it may be the case that we have not organised our agenda very well today. If having free trade agreements means that we allow products to enter Europe that respect neither our social standards nor our environmental standards, the reform of the common agricultural policy will be pointless. Clearly we cannot continue to take this hypocritical approach where, on the one hand, we impose environmental restrictions relating to health and safety traceability on our farmers, on the grounds that we have to protect consumers, and, on the other hand, we allow products that fail to meet these standards to enter our continent freely. That is precisely the issue being discussed behind the scenes at the negotiations with Mercosur. Although we are being told that Parliament was very well informed and that matters have been as transparent and as clear as possible, the way in which things have been initiated does not give us a good impression of a negotiation that is being held at the same time as other negotiations are taking place at the WTO. For the sake of consistency, and of protecting consumers and our farmers, I feel that we cannot continue down this track. Christophe Béchu  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, there has to be consistency in politics. Over the last few weeks, many of us in this House have demanded measures from the Commission. When solutions are proposed to us, we will vote in favour of those solutions, even if – I agree with what has been said – they are slow in coming and even if they have had to be extracted by means of the positions adopted both within the European Parliament and among ministers. This amount, which will be useful in the very short term, does not resolve, as many have already said, the long-term issues concerning the way in which the planned end of quotas is dealt with. If we want to be in a position to cope with and to prevent repeated crises within the agricultural produce sector, there is no way that we can do so without production regulation and control tools or without a combination of the two. That is not the issue at stake this evening, however. The issue at stake this evening, the only issue that counts at the moment, is that of Article 186. Commissioner, I have one simple question: in concrete terms, what is Article 186 meant to do, and from when and in what way? Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

Improving economic governance must be one of the European Union’s priorities and that is why I supported this report. It is essential to increase the economic dialogue between the Member States and the EU institutions. In that regard, wage increases must be in line with productivity.

As the permanent rapporteur for the European Social Fund (ESF), I welcome the fact that the report emphasises the importance of respecting the vote by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to endorse the Commission proposal to earmark 25 % of the total cohesion policy allocation to the ESF. The ESF is the main tool for promoting social integration through professional integration; it is absolutely essential to maintain this tool and increase its use in the period from 2014 to 2020.

This agreement underlines the scope of its commitments that will not only improve the situation of Russian consumers, who will benefit from better services, it will also provide new business opportunities for EU firms, and for EU exporters and investors already working with Russia.

 Madam President, as we are talking of economic returns in relation to pay equality, I have a question for you: the Member States invest as much in the training of girls as they do in that of boys; it seems to me that, if we followed your argument to its logical conclusion, that has to be a rather poor investment, has it not? That is not a view I share. On the contrary, I believe that we must encourage women’s work and value it. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Ms Bauer for her work, which I fully support. However, secondly, and this request is for you, Commissioner, could you tell Ms Reding that our patience is running out? Today we are in a position where the Charter of Fundamental Rights is being blatantly violated by pay inequalities which trouble no one. I was upset by hearing you say that things had got better because the gap had been reduced from 17.5% to 16.4%. I was upset because I truly believe that Europe has a crucial role to play in showing the Member States the way forward. We must of course respect the equality of citizens before the law; that is a fundamental right and we must ensure it is respected. However, over and above this, what we want is transparency, transparency so that everyone is aware of the real pay gap that exists in our society. The public sector should set an example. SMEs too clearly have a role to play, as does the private sector, but the public sector must also set an example. That is why, when Ms Bauer calls for encouragement and also for sanctions, I think we should support any future legal appeals that women bring against pay disparities. The Member States clearly need to be coerced, private business clearly needs to be coerced, but we also need to coerce the public sector, and we must adopt every possible measure, as Mr Gustafsson said just now, to ensure that women benefit from the pay equality that is achieved. We have had enough. We want growth and, for there to be growth, we need women. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

 By voting for this report, I am supporting the clarification that is needed of the measures to combat imports subject to subsidies by countries not members of the European Union.

 By voting in favour of this report, I wish to affirm that Europe exists to serve its citizens. Until now, roaming tariffs have been much more expensive than the price of domestic communications, for no good reason. The new EU regulation puts an end to these unfair tariffs by imposing price caps and enabling consumers to choose an operator other than their national operator for roaming services. This regulation represents a great leap forward for European citizens, who will now have more control over their mobile phone bill. Elisabeth Morin-Chartier  (PPE

The report actually encourages them to strengthen their exchanges so as to adapt their curricula to a growing number of students from a wide range of backgrounds. It also calls for the links between higher education institutions to be strengthened so as to allow students to gain initial work experience, on the one hand, and have a choice of teaching that better responds to the specific needs of the labour market, on the other.

 I welcome the approval of the European Union’s accession to the Offshore Protocol. This attests to the need for increased safety and sustainable governance of oil and gas activities in the Mediterranean. The Barcelona Convention mechanism supplements the commitments made by the EU in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Union for the Mediterranean through the flagship initiative for de-pollution of the Mediterranean, ‘Horizon 2020’. In addition to the ‘sensitive areas’ investment programme for the Mediterranean, supported by the European neighbourhood and partnership instrument, other EU programmes deserve a mention: strengthening the capacities of environmental authorities, systems for sharing information on the environment, sustainable water management, cooperation on urban development and dialogue and various other research projects. It is important for the next multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 to put EU support for de-pollution of the Mediterranean on a long-term footing.

 This Parliamentary report presents a balanced and calm approach to a highly controversial subject, and I am pleased about this. I am of the opinion that the choice of energy mix and shale gas extraction permits are of national competence. This conforms to the principle of technological neutrality I defend under the Energy Roadmap 2050. This is why I do not agree with the idea of a European moratorium on shale gas exploration and extraction. Nevertheless, the European Union should draw up, on a European scale, rules that guarantee protection of the environment and high safety levels. At present, hydraulic fracturing poses serious problems that cannot be ignored. Moreover, while there is talk of abundant shale hydrocarbon resources in Europe, no one can say with certainty that the potential is sufficiently promising to envisage industrial exploitation. Therefore, to make enlightened choices, let us continue evaluating the presumed reserves and researching exploration techniques. Let us not close the door on this energy source, in view of the developments on the world energy market and the stakes with regard to competitiveness for Europe. Gaston Franco  (PPE

I voted in favour of the 2013 budget because it maintains the European programme for the most deprived persons. I would stress, however, that this programme must be maintained in the next financial framework for 2014-2020; the challenge is to focus on the long term because the associations need to be visible in order to carry out their missions in full. A year ago, many associations expressed their concern that the funding for the programme had been called into question by the Court of Justice of the European Union, putting the food supply of 18 million people in jeopardy. That situation was unacceptable and it does not reflect the idea of a protective Europe that I defend. Thanks to the mobilisation of many governments, including François Fillon’s Government at that time, an agreement was reached in the Council of the European Union to maintain the programme’s funding for two more years, namely 2012 and 2013. The beneficiaries of the programme can be reassured that the financial envelope of EUR 500 million will certainly be maintained in 2013 and I welcome that.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Mr Kariņš, for this difficult report, given the sensitive nature of bilateral negotiations in the field of energy between the Member States and third countries. The agreement reached in trialogue will allow the rapid implementation of the Commission’s draft decision and, wishing to be pragmatic, we cannot but welcome it. Europe of energy is making progress, admittedly slow progress, but nevertheless progress. The European Union relies heavily on imported energy, and is in a position of structural dependence on certain supplier countries. In order for our thinking on our energy strategy to become more European, it therefore became necessary to make information on energy agreements more widely available in the Commission, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity. The establishment of an information exchange mechanism with regard to intergovernmental agreements will therefore ensure greater transparency of the energy market and, thus, allow us to anticipate problems of energy supply. I welcome the fact that this decision does not create obligations as regards agreements between commercial entities. At times of crisis and, given the issues involved in terms of competition and competitiveness, we have a duty to protect our companies’ interests and the safeguards for private contracts. Gaston Franco  (PPE

This text is realistic and ambitious. The proposed regulatory framework is an important step towards achieving the goals set within the energy and climate package, as well as promoting green growth and employment. With the addition of the European sectoral measures on energy efficiency and the provisions taken at national level by Member States, the European Union should therefore be in a position to meet its indicative target for energy efficiency, set at 20% by 2020. It is essential to fight against waste, control energy use and drive innovation, without reducing our production and economic activity. At a time when the issue of energy costs is on everyone’s mind, let us not forget that the best energy is that which we do not consume. Finally, I am particularly pleased with the provisions of the directive which aim to promote heating and cooling efficiency. However, I do regret that the final compromise does not incorporate my amendment aimed at creating a category of cogeneration units between 1 and 20 MW in remote areas that are disadvantaged and have insufficient electricity, in particular where resources are available nearby. This could have helped stimulate decentralised energy production in rural areas. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Member for the quality of his report, which I will support with pleasure. Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, our economy and our industry in Europe depend on resources and raw materials, the prices of which are become increasingly unstable and access to which is becoming uncertain in a context of fierce international competition. These include, for example, rare earths, which are necessary for many new technologies, and of which China holds almost all the mining potential. In order to protect not only our industrial competitiveness but also our environment, it is imperative that we learn how to be less dependent on these resources by developing innovation and recycling. The European Union must move towards a real circular economy, in which extending the life cycle of materials would be a priority, from the product design stage right through to the re-use and recycling of waste. With a view to efficiency, recovering energy from waste must also be promoted. We must also turn to the sustainable exploitation of resources, the potential of which is still too often underestimated. I should like to emphasise the importance of the natural capital represented by forest resources. Timber is a renewable energy source and an ideal, healthy and natural building material. Faced with the dynamism of emerging powers, we must adopt a more proactive and more imaginative attitude in the use of resources so that we can return to growth. The European Union must encourage its enterprises to create more innovative and more sustainable products. It must also exert an influence on the behaviour of consumers by empowering them. I therefore support the experiments in progress on the environmental impact labelling of products, the aim of which is to give Europeans credible information on the environmental impact of their consumption choices. Let us not forget that resources like water, for example, are fragile and precious goods. Gaston Franco,

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Leinen, thank you for the work that we have carried out together. The European Union needs a manifesto, a common political vision with regard to the major environmental challenges for 2020 and beyond. That is why it is so useful to launch a 7th Environment Action Programme harmonising the existing financial frameworks and mobilising new funding resources. This programme should ensure that the EU’s environmental strategies are consistent with, and integrated into, sectoral policies, whether these relate to agriculture, fishing, research and innovation, health, transport, regional development or land management and, of course, urban policies. In spite of the economic crisis that has been giving the European Union a hard time, we must not give in to a short-term vision and abandon all ambition in terms of the environment and climate. To do nothing would be fatal. The issues are too important, particularly with regard to efficient resource use and valuing natural capital. We must therefore invest resolutely in the sustainable economy and eco-innovation, which are sources of growth, competitiveness and jobs. It is up to us to promote eco-design and recycling, but also environmental labelling of products in order to avoid waste and poor consumption choices. We cannot overlook this environmental lesson that European citizens need. The Environment Action Programme is a political programming instrument, but it is also a communication tool. It must provide the readability and predictability that is necessary not only for national and local authorities and citizens, but also for entrepreneurs and investors with regard to the European Union’s environmental choices. European regulation must not become a punishment or a vice. Gaston Franco  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that this amending budget concerning the financing of ITER was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Budgets on 29 March. By financing this cost overrun, we avoid scrapping a fundamental strategic research project in which the European Union has a leading role, and we honour our international commitments. Let us remember that none of the seven partners of the EURATOM community has questioned its overall contribution to the project. Japan, despite the drama of Fukushima, decided to honour its budgetary commitments in ITER to the full. Without this agreement, hundreds of researchers would have had to suspend their work and the ITER project would have suffered detrimental delays. Today, 1 000 people work for ITER in Cadarache. In the period from 2015 to 2017-2018, the building construction and machine assembly phase saw between 4 000 and 5 000 people deployed on this site.

 I welcome the motion for a resolution adopted by the European Parliament ahead of the forthcoming climate change conference in Durban. It is vital that we reach an international, legally binding agreement. We call on the European Union to confirm its strong commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and to show its unequivocal support for a second commitment period post-2012. The EU must formally invite all of its international partners to do the same, in order to achieve the objectives set by the Kyoto Protocol, namely reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting global warming linked to climate change to 2°C. This resolution has allowed us to turn the spotlight on a subject that is very close to my heart: improving forest management as a prerequisite for reducing deforestation. In particular, we have emphasised the need to implement the mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). Parliament has thus sent a strong message aimed at the establishment of a proper mechanism for combating deforestation, which accounts for some 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 Given the extent of the European and international disasters that we have faced, such as the tsunami in 2004, Haiti in 2010 and Fukushima in 2011, it is high time that Europe had an effective system to ensure a rapid response to disasters. That is why I welcome the adoption of this report, which is the first step towards a harmonised, organised and united response from the European Union. I tabled a number of amendments, which were adopted in the final report, to emphasise the importance of prevention in crisis management and the organisation of this prevention through operational tools, which I welcome. Until more thought has been given to the establishment of any real future European civil protection force, I think that the creation of a European emergency response centre will simplify the current European Civil Protection Mechanism. I called for this European centre to be equipped with two Community tools to protect forests from forest fires, EFFIS and EFFICS, which was adopted in the final report. Gaston Franco  (PPE

 As the rapporteur for the opinion of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I would like to congratulate Carlo Fidanza on his excellent report, which is a foundation stone for a true European strategy to stimulate and complement the Member States’ action in the tourism field. Tourism is a key industry, and a source of growth and job creation. Europe needs tourism that is in phase with the modern world, the changes in world demand and the changes in our societies. We need tourism that is innovative and competitive but that also respects the environment, local cultures and local conditions. In a context of international competition between destinations, we have everything to gain from promoting our assets, our trades and our know-how, and from better communicating our unique European and national features. Therefore, the recent creation of a festival of French gastronomy celebrated on the first day of autumn is an excellent initiative that we should welcome. Sustainable tourism, cultural tourism, business and conference tourism, health tourism: these are the priorities. We should also establish Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in the tourism field in the wake of the Arab Spring. We need to make every effort together to bring prosperity to the Mediterranean on the basis of common standards and projects. Gaston Franco  (PPE
),

 I welcome the adoption of this own-initiative report aimed at improving the safety of offshore oil and gas platforms. Following the Gulf of Mexico disaster, I voiced my support for an improvement in safety in order to prevent a repeat of this kind of disaster, which not only endangers marine ecosystems but also severely affects the economic sectors of fishing and tourism. Parliament has voted in favour of stricter controls by independent experts and of the adoption of contingency plans prior to each operation, which I believe is an effective and proportionate response to the need to improve the safety of these platforms. Parliament has also referred to the industry’s liability in the event of a disaster, in accordance with the polluter pays principle, but without overlooking the supervisory and coordinating role that the public sector must play. I am pleased that my political group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), has insisted that no moratorium be imposed on the subject. Indeed, the introduction of a moratorium on all new deep-sea oil drilling in EU waters would be a disproportionate reaction to the need to ensure high safety standards across the EU.

 I welcome the adoption of this report, which is undoubtedly a step towards an EU energy policy promoting the successful interconnection of energy networks between Member States across national and regional borders. In order to address major challenges in the development and security of energy infrastructure in Europe, the European Parliament wished to adopt an own-initiative report in anticipation of the legislative proposal concerning a new European instrument in this field. Interconnection capacity or its availability between Member States still remains insufficient in one-third of the Union. Modernisation, cross-border interconnection and timely adaptation of energy infrastructure are essential to achieving the energy objectives for 2020, especially those concerning the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix of Member States. Market-based tools and the user-pay principle should remain the basis for financing energy infrastructure. However, the rapporteur realistically identified criteria defining projects ‘of European interest’ likely to obtain public finance, which has to result in an innovative mix of financial instruments that levers private investment. Gaston Franco  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about improving the safety of nuclear power, not about calling civil nuclear power into question when it is an essential component of energy independence and of the fight against greenhouse gases in many Member States of the European Union. The European initiative of performing stress tests on all our power stations is a first essential and reasonable step which responds to the expectations of European citizens. We must carry out these tests using a common approach and common criteria whose methodology will have to be entrusted to the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group. The neighbouring countries of the European Union should also undergo these tests, given the cross-border risks that exist. Besides these tests, the European Union must work to harmonise international standards at the highest level, within the G20 and the International Atomic Energy Agency, on the basis of the Western European Nuclear Regulators’ Association’s objectives for new reactors. Within the European Union, we should promote and intensify cooperation between the national safety authorities. The European Union must serve as a model, both for the strengthening of the rules and for efforts in solidarity. In the face of this type of disaster, I think that the creation of a European Civil Protection Force is needed more than ever. Gaston Franco  (PPE
),

 I am delighted that, after five years of negotiations, Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) have been concluded with Cameroon and with the Republic of the Congo. These agreements will help ensure good forest governance by granting FLEGT licences to timber products from these countries and thus guaranteeing the sustainable exploitation and management of their forests. It is essential to have a system by which to monitor movements of timber and derived products from harvesting right up to export. Twenty to thirty per cent of world industrial timber production is illegal, as is 60% of the harvesting that has taken place in Africa over the last 10 years. These VPAs will therefore help preserve the forests in these countries by combating illegal harvesting, which causes significant environmental, economic and social damage. The main advantage of these VPAs is that they will apply to all exports between the EU and these countries, together with all other timber importing countries. I hope that this VPA system will be rolled out quickly to other forest countries. Gaston Franco  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is quite rightly asking itself whether an oil disaster such as the one that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico could happen in our waters. Since oil spills have destroyed our coasts and left a lasting impression on us numerous times in the past, we quite rightly believe that the preservation and protection of marine ecosystems, animal biodiversity and the economic sectors of fishing and tourism are of paramount importance. However, we must keep a cool head and resist adopting an extreme position which the introduction of a moratorium on any further deep-water oil drilling in Europe would represent. Firstly, because we have very strict safety standards for exploitation and exploration in Europe. Furthermore, national regulators and oil companies in Europe have themselves pledged to amend the exploitation and safety rules and procedures if the outcome of the US investigation into the disaster so demands. Secondly, in view of our requirement for energy independence, it would be highly risky, from a geostrategic point of view, to abandon our North Sea drilling operations. Ultimately, it is the future of our oil industry that we are jeopardising if we shut down its exploration and extraction activities. How could we justify the consequent impact on employment growth in a time of crisis? Gaston Franco  (PPE
),

 Nowadays, 20-30% of industrial timber production worldwide is from illegal sources. We need to clean up the European timber market as soon as possible. While it could still be improved, the proposed regulation is ambitious and courageous. In my view, it is an effective tool for limiting rampant deforestation, without imposing administrative constraints on our European companies or harming timber, which will, on the contrary, become more highly valued. The regulation establishes a binding provision which delegates responsibilities on the basis of the ‘due diligence system’. This allows operators to trace timber and timber products, to access information on observance of the applicable legislation and, thus, to obtain sufficient guarantees to prevent the sale of products from logging considered to be illegal. The obligations contained in the regulation must target those operators who place timber on the market for the first time, because that is when there is the most risk. Furthermore, in order to guarantee that this regulation is effective, we should emphasise the need for regular controls and a system of stringent, deterrent penalties for offenders.

I am surprised by the absence of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy from the scene of the natural disaster in Haiti. In spite of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union still has difficulty in showing its face on the international stage, and that is most regrettable. It seems to me that the European crisis response system is too fragmented, too complex and not successful enough. In terms of the rehabilitation of Haiti (for which EUR 100 million are earmarked) and the reconstruction of the country (EUR 200 million), what exactly will the EDF and the Stability Instrument fund? Furthermore, to respond to the UN request in terms of logistical and security support, the European Union must, in my view, be in a position to use all the instruments provided by the Treaty of Lisbon, including military response. I call for the rapid establishment of a European civil protection force as devised by Mr Barnier in 2006 with the aim of arriving at a European response that is planned, genuinely coordinated and effective. The recent statements by Mr Van Rompuy are along the right lines. He advocated the creation of a humanitarian rapid reaction force. What will be the exact nature of this project and when will it see the light of day? Gaston Franco  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this summer, once again, the Mediterranean forest was engulfed in flames: in Marseille and in southern Corsica, but also in Italy, in Spain and, on a larger scale, in Greece. More than 400 000 hectares of forest and field went up in smoke, causing considerable material damage, irreparable damage to biodiversity, and the tragic loss of human lives. Dismayed as I am by this assessment made repeatedly, year after year, and mindful as I am of the multiplier effect of global warming on fires, I call for European awareness of the need for more coordinated efforts and for the pooling of fire-fighting resources. I should like to see a huge Euro-Mediterranean cooperation project to combat forest fires take shape under the Union for the Mediterranean. I welcome the existing initiatives and, in particular, the European Forest Fire Information System – the pilot project. Nevertheless, I call for a reform of the European Union Solidarity Fund so that it will become an effective tool for responding to crises. I also call for the strengthening of the European protection force and of the ‘EuropeAid’ facility devised by Mr Barnier in 2006 for intervention on the territory of the 27 Member States, as well as abroad. I believe that one of the keys to the problem of forest fires has to do with information sharing and best practice as regards prevention, and I should like to point out the pioneering role played by the forest fire fighters in my own department. I can, of course, provide Europe with this example, which may be of use. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur
. − Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report today is an assessment of what is now a significant part of European economic governance. I would like to thank the group rapporteurs, with whom I was able − and this is not just words − to undertake genuine constructive work. I believe that this report, taken overall, reflects the concerns of everyone, even if not all have been taken up in a strict sense.  This report was also undertaken in close cooperation with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in accordance with Rule 50, which explains why the report takes up a number of provisions in their entirety, without a vote, so as to properly respect those rules and the ideas of that committee; the rules prevailed. I am not going to list the various points we are emphasising in terms of the Semester content; I would rather talk about what concerned us the most, namely the method. The Semester is, as I was saying, a very important element in establishing coordination of States’ economic and financial policies and involves both European and national levels. That is already something new. In fact, while the Commission’s proposals must next be validated by the Council before being reflected, as far as possible, in national budgets, there is a need, in terms of democratic control, for sound understanding and proper coordination with national parliaments. In this regard, we know − and I do not think anyone will mind me saying − that some of our national parliaments do not fully understand Community Mechanisms and there is a certain apprehension when they see the European level take precedence over national level. That is why some, quite legitimately, assert that national sovereignty entitles them to adopt the budget they want and that they do not have to obey instructions or orders from elsewhere. There is, therefore, undoubtedly work to be done to educate and explain. Indeed, a meeting was recently held in Brussels with the representatives of the financial or economic committees of the national parliaments to explain this European Semester. I had the opportunity, as rapporteur, to say that MEPs have no intention whatsoever of interfering in national relations or the working of national parliaments and that, in reality, the European Parliament and national parliaments have a specific task, that of providing democratic control at their level. I think that in future such meetings will have to be repeated to encourage understanding of the system and its proper application. In this regard, it would certainly be a good thing for these meetings, currently organised in a fairly ad hoc way, to be more formal and, in particular, for those attending the meetings to be able to do so regularly, so that genuine dialogue may be established between national parliaments and the European Parliament. On issues of method, we also stress the need, for instance, for recommendations to be more explicit so that outcomes may be evaluated and, if necessary, corrected. Lastly, I will add that it is also important for States to meet the commitments they have themselves made. It seems an obvious thing to say but, unfortunately, the opposite is often seen. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur
. − Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for passing on our observations to Mr Rehn, but he had taken the trouble of telephoning me yesterday to explain that he would be detained elsewhere today and I was grateful to him for doing so. Sometimes our debates are accused of being simply a string of words with no discernible direct impact on the work presented by the rapporteur. I would like, today, to try to prove the opposite and to respond to those Members − I thank all those who have spoken − who made a request. As regards Ms Trautmann’s request, I will give very serious consideration to withdrawing Amendments 4 and 5. Of course, I have to talk to my Group, since I am a loyal ordinary foot soldier; but I will do all I can to please you and to follow the recommendation made to me, by telephone, by my friend Mr Lamassoure. As regards the reference to the Fiscal Stability Treaty, there is a paragraph where we had fun but, strictly speaking, this reference is not of any consequence. In addition, we could be accused of talking about intergovernmentalism in a Union text; I will therefore also ask the Group for authority to remove paragraph 23 entirely. I hope that, in this way, the excellent cooperative work undertaken during preparation of this report may continue until the vote and thus show Parliament’s determination to make the European Semester a highly effective exercise. In this regard, I would like to say to Ms Zuber –
 I am a little sorry, Commissioner Barnier also just answered her –
 but it seems to me that we are not living in a time bubble and, without European solidarity, I dare not think what would be happening in some countries today. I think that has to be taken into account. Europe is not in the process of oppressing countries in difficulty. I think, on the contrary, that it is endeavouring to help them. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, to start with, I would of course like to congratulate you and thank you for the extremely thorough and very expeditious work that you have carried out to introduce the two proposals that are here before us today. We shall play a different role in each of them, which will also be dependent on the legal basis. However, Commissioner, I feel, when I listen to what each of you has to say and read the newspapers, that these negotiations are fraught with danger, because people’s opinions are different. The commitments entered into are not clear. Yet, we are currently being watched closely by our fellow citizens, who want to understand and see what Europe is doing, by our entrepreneurs, who want to know if they can invest, and by the markets, which are anxious to know what to do. I believe that, in the coming months and weeks, the direction that the negotiations take will be a determining factor. I shall not go into technical details here, as they will be the subject of the debate, but I shall merely observe that, unless we show a real European spirit, unless we show that we can set aside short-term national interests and unless we are able to put in place genuinely robust European institutions, all our work will be to no avail and cause disappointment. I am confident in your determination, Commissioner, which I know to be unflagging. You have a record that does credit to you and, therefore, we can say that luck is on our side. It is now up to the Member States to shoulder their responsibilities and rise above squabbles over technical matters. The issue is not how we share out one minor competence or another. The real issue is whether we are able to create banking union, or at least a quality prudential control system, to put finance at the service of the economy. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). -  
(FR) 
Mr President, I am talking about the rule on blue-card questions. You have just made the observation that I wished to make. I wanted to know whether, on the subject of banking Union, we were not perhaps spectators at an island ping-pong competition. I believe that the system which consists of hijacking the use of blue-card questions by asking questions to friends of one's own group, thereby increasing one's speaking time, is essentially a poor use of the procedure. I am astonished that this should come from a country where fair play is generally held in high esteem. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, I would like to thank my colleagues for their support and I propose that the report be referred back to committee so that we can start the trialogue discussions and try to reach an agreement at first reading. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Minister, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to recap on why this report has come back to the plenary sitting today, after having been adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). The regulation on countries experiencing difficulties, for which I was rapporteur, was adopted by 25 votes to 4, with 13 abstentions. The abstentions were primarily by the Socialists. However, they did vote in favour of most of the amendments and all of the compromise amendments. Before opening the negotiations, which, from what we have been hearing from the Presidency, will not be easy, I felt it was important to obtain a more solid mandate from plenary. When the time comes, therefore, I will ask that we do not proceed with the vote on the legislative resolution so that, if applicable, we can secure an agreement at first reading. This draft regulation on strengthening economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability in the euro area is set against the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis that the European Union is facing and will continue to face. The Union is trying to learn lessons from the crisis, and to propose solutions. The Commission’s proposals complement the package on economic governance: the ‘six-pack’ adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2011. Excessive national debt can have dramatic consequences, both within the countries concerned and for the other Member States of the European Union. The difficulties of a small country can even have global repercussions. What is at risk is the euro area’s reputation, rather than its existence. The serious economic and social consequences that some Member States are experiencing today could have been avoided if early, targeted action had been taken. At the time, the European Union did not have the necessary instruments, but this will now be put right by the combination of the ‘six-pack’ and two new pieces of legislation (the ‘two-pack’), including this one. The ‘six-pack’ needs to be strengthened, in order to ensure both financial stability and economic growth in the euro area. Several Member States have had to seek financial assistance. Preventive action at an early stage is preferable to corrective measures taken later – perhaps too late – in the proceedings. The broad thrust of the draft regulation adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is in line with the original proposal, which provides for a Member State whose currency is the euro to be subject to enhanced surveillance when it is experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, severe financial disturbance. It should be swiftly returned to a normal situation and the other euro area Member States should be protected against possible negative spillover effects. The regulation sets out clear procedures to this effect for countries experiencing difficulties. The parliamentary committee was keen to increase the powers that the original proposal gave the Commission, in particular, by introducing wider use of the reverse qualified majority rule in Council votes. For example, this rule would apply when the Commission recommends that a country should take corrective measures, or when it instructs a country to submit new debt reduction plans. Such decisions would be deemed to have been adopted unless the Council categorically rejected them. It is worth mentioning that ECON adopted the protection system for States in major difficulties by a wide majority. I would like to point out that there were no negotiations on this amendment and that the vote was left to each individual’s judgment. A majority of our Members chose not to heed the arguments put forward by detractors of this proposal, which were partly based on a distorted presentation of its objective. The intention is not to organise a restructuring or reduction of the debt, but to allow the State to get itself back into shape so that it can deal with its obligations. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.
 – (FR)
 Mr President, in view of the time, we have to avoid making very long speeches. I would just like to mention to the Commissioner that I share his concern that we should move swiftly and thereby show how effective the community method is. I would like to tell the President-in-Office of the Council, who really could not care less, that it is our firm intention to gain a large majority vote here and to start the trialogue. Before the debate began this morning, there was the matter of Schengen and the Danish Presidency. I hope that on this subject, you will show that you are able to take Parliament’s opinions into account. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Mr President, this tax has caused quite a stir, and we have seen how some of our colleagues have engaged in mudslinging before immediately leaving the debate. I would like to simply reiterate the fact that Parliament has already made its position regarding this tax very clear through several resolutions and decisions. I think that the important thing today is effective implementation, because we are sustaining the report with a whole series of plans, a whole series of words and, behind it, nothing much is happening. In my opinion, it is important for us to be realistic. Since this is a tax matter, Parliament is only being consulted on this report and, in view of this, I feel we must be clear and concise when stating our views. The Commission’s proposal is interesting and good, and I believe we should support it. We must not try to weaken it; there are already strong disagreements within the Council and the chances of seeing the success of this report as we wish, at EU level, are relatively slim. That is why some people suggest that we work in closer cooperation. That is one of the ideas. Parliament is only consulted on this subject, but we should put all the necessary efforts in place. The position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is clear. After discussions and equivocations, the PPE Group is, today, in favour of the financial transaction tax. We would like the tax to be as comprehensive as possible, but, as the PPE Group is realistic, we know that this is not possible in the current climate. We would like the tax to be adopted at European level and that it not be implemented at a lower level, as this would certainly be detrimental to the European financial economy. We must not look the other way: if there were no European internal market – the European market forms a single entity and, personally, I do not believe in running away from things – if it falls to a lower geographical level, there is a real risk.

 Mr President, Mr Fox, we should always be optimistic. Anything can happen. They may see the light. I think that when faced with reality, with the problems of the economic crisis and the need to obtain financial means in a fair way, and also to avoid speculation and ensure the reform of financial activity, everyone can see that this tax would be useful. To reiterate my view, I would like this tax to be established at European Union level. If is it necessary to go in at a lower level, it must not go too low geographically, so as not to create distorted competition, which would be detrimental. I hope that the Member States who are not currently in favour of it will see the light. I am counting on Mr Šemeta’s conviction to drive this report forwards, and I encourage him to do so. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, Commissioner, alongside the recovery of public finances, the question of growth is key to the success of the European strategy. In this regard, what is to be the role of the European Central Bank, which has shown extraordinary creativity during the financial crisis? Make no mistake. It is not a matter of making some completely unrealistic revision to the treaty. It is, in reality, about creating political conditions for the ECB to take the action it has undertaken further by buying sovereign debt on the secondary market and injecting liquidity into the financial system. Experience shows that this is possible within the existing legal framework without undermining the independence of the ECB or backtracking on its objectives. It is a question of European solidarity and political will, and not of legal provisions. However, recovery of public finances and prevention of the risk of crises remain a priority. Economic governance of the euro area is being strengthened. Mechanisms for the detection, prevention and sanction of abuses have been reinforced by the ‘six-pack’ initiative. The ‘two-pack’ initiative is under negotiation and there must be a conclusion on this subject soon. This negotiation must particularly make it possible to develop effective, practical measures for the benefit of Member States in difficulty or whose deficits are excessive. In this regard, we must ensure that democratic control is exercised as normal at European level to make the steps to be taken in this area acceptable to the people, the citizens. I would like to conclude by stressing that it would be desirable for the Commission’s proposal to be supplemented by legal protection for any Member State in extreme difficulty – not to encourage complacency but, on the contrary, to allow them to recover and meet their obligations. This provision should be controlled by the Commission under the supervision of the Council and Parliament. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the draft directive aims to implement within the European Union a common consolidated corporate tax base, known as the CCCTB. This has been under discussion since 2004. Today, Parliament, having been asked for its opinion and by way of Marianne Thyssen’s report, wishes – or in any case, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wishes – to send a strong message encouraging the Commission to continue its work in this area. The implementation of a CCCTB in the European Union offers many benefits, both for economic operators – by removing tax obstacles from the internal market – and for Member States – by enabling more transparent and therefore healthier tax competition between Member States. The report, voted through by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and presented by Ms Thyssen, is excellent. After lengthy negotiations and skilful identification of how best to address a very delicate issue, that is to say, the voluntary or optional nature of the system, she is proposing – and has reached agreement on – a phased transition, with the regime becoming immediately compulsory for European companies and cooperatives, to be extended to all companies with the exception of SMEs after five years, following review by the Commission. Commissioner, I believe the Commission should be more demanding in this area. I know the proposal is not strongly supported by several Member States, either due to a principled opposition, such as that of the United Kingdom, to complete tax harmonisation, or due to fears that would be provoked by implementation of this system. This is the stance of Poland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, for example. It must be disregarded. It is crucial for the European Union that this consolidated base, which does not involve a harmonisation of taxes, is implemented. That is the view taken of your proposal by the PPE Group.

Mr President, President Van Rompuy, first of all, let me congratulate you on your reappointment, Mr Van Rompuy. I am among those who, since you were first appointed, have been trying to explain to citizens that your task is a difficult one. I hope that you will continue to execute it with just as much persistence. I know that it is difficult. Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about citizens. I am sorry to have to say today that Europe is losing its credibility. I will not get involved in the national electoral battle: this is neither the time nor the place for that. One may, however, ask why such statements may be publicly accepted. Due to the fact that they are not rejected by public opinion, they are adopted by a very large majority simply because our fellow citizens no longer have any faith in Europe. It may be possible to exercise faith in certain areas. However, I believe that for Europe, what we need is reality. Today, I admire all those who, every month, or every week, make their speeches once again to say the same thing, and I pity those who write them, because what our citizens are looking for is action, and not words. We should spend less time speaking and more time taking action. Today, there are various causes behind the weakening of Europe. The first is, clearly, the way that the crisis has led to nations turning in on themselves. Each country is seeing things only from its point of view, looking at what is going on nationally without taking into account the European dimension, which is the only one that might save us. The second cause is the weakening of the Commission. The Commission appears silent. I am not saying that the Commission is not doing anything: it is working, but no one notices what it is actually doing because there is no clear plan. What is missing is a small package of specific actions that would allow citizens to compare what has been announced with what has been done. Let us take the case of Greece. It is very clear that Greece’s situation is tragic. Why are we giving the impression that it has now been resolved? It has not. One problem has been resolved to allow the plan to work, but in another year or two, problems will arise once again, because strong measures need to be taken. In addition, in the ‘two-pack’ that has been mentioned, I am proposing a safeguard measure for countries in difficulty. However, I was told by the Commission that it was an attack on the market. In fact, when you talk to the markets, what they want is to know where we are going and how we are getting there. They want to stick with the measures that have been taken, and not to change them every fortnight. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, first of all, I would like to say here that I think what is in the treaty could very well appear in European law, and on this point I believe I am in agreement with the Commission. This was said just now by President Barroso, when he stated that the Commission is making proposals to include a number of parties. Therefore, I do not intend to withdraw anything at all. I believe that we need rigour. Only a fool builds his house on the sand. If we now want to get the situation back on track, we must simultaneously balance rigour and growth. Growth, however, is not to be sought in newspaper articles or theories. Growth must be found in innovation, in entrepreneurship, in the mobilisation of entrepreneurs and in confidence. That is what we should work on together. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, every year, the Annual Growth Survey allows us to define the European Union’s economic and budgetary priorities and actions. I should first like to thank the Commission for having published its report before the end of November, thus allowing Parliament to carry out, in good time, some painstaking work. We would like this schedule to become permanent, so that Parliament has time enough to express its views before annual economic guidelines are decided upon by the Spring European Council. This year, on the occasion of the review of this report, Parliament wishes to strongly urge Member States to implement effectively those measures required by the policies that they themselves have undertaken to pursue. Obviously, the primary aim of these measures should be to find a way out of the sovereign debt crisis. They should go hand in hand with a growth strategy based on improving competitiveness. It is clearly also important to promote a sustainable economy which creates jobs. Parliament agrees with the Commission’s analysis that efforts at national and EU level should concentrate on the following five priorities: pursuing differentiated growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, while ensuring economic recovery and job creation; ensuring long-term financing of the real economy; promoting sustainable growth through more competitiveness and investments; tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis, and, finally, modernising EU public administration and services of general interest. As regards fiscal consolidation, Member States should pursue differentiated strategies according to their budgetary situations and keep their public expenditure growth below the rate of medium-term trend GDP growth. Member States must prioritise, on the expenditure and revenue sides of the budget, growth-friendly policies, particularly in the areas of education, research, innovation, infrastructure and energy, and ensure the efficiency of such expenditures and revenues. As regards ensuring the long-term financing of the real economy, Parliament welcomes the determined efforts by Commissioner Barnier to overhaul the regulation and supervision of the financial sector. If investor confidence is to be restored, the banks’ capital positions must be strengthened and measures must be taken to support their access to funding. Thirdly, the promotion of sustainable growth presupposes an increase in the competitiveness of investments. In this respect, Parliament is worried by the macro-economic imbalances within the EU and the fact that many Member States are falling behind in terms of productivity. Enhanced coordination of economic policies as well as structural reforms are needed to tackle these problems in both deficit and surplus countries in an adequate way. Modernising EU public administration and services of general interest is also a determining element of competitiveness and an important productivity factor. In future, Parliament wishes to be more closely involved in drawing up the main political and economic guidelines. It should be noted that the European Semester is now part of EU secondary legislation. The economic governance legal framework provides the tool of economic dialogue to enhance the dialogue between the EU institutions and to ensure greater transparency. We are anxious for this to be so, and I shall conclude shortly after the various speeches to be made, in the two minutes that remain to me, Mr President. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, this is certainly not the best time to speak. However, I, too, would like to commend the excellent cooperation between the rapporteurs, Ms Cornelissen, Ms Berès and myself and the shadow rapporteurs. On the substance of the debate, I would like to say that what is needed today is for words to be backed up by actions, and that is undoubtedly the hardest thing to achieve. As regards its form, I would like to point out that the 2012 European Semester will be the first to come under the new legal framework of enhanced economic governance. In order to ensure that Parliament is well informed, we urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the Commission provides a detailed assessment of the implementation, by the Member States, of the recommendations in each country. The Council, for its part, is required to provide a public explanation of its position within the framework of economic dialogue with Parliament, when its position deviates significantly from the Commission’s recommendations and proposals. It is quite clear that the States can retain a degree of discretion under the principle of subsidiarity. The new legal framework stipulates that Parliament must be duly involved in the European Semester in order to increase transparency and accountability for decisions, particularly through economic dialogue, as provided for by the relevant secondary legislation. In this respect, I should like to conclude by reminding you of the requests made by Parliament to the Council and the Commission in its resolution of 1 December 2011. It is important to give this resolution a precise public response. The reality and effectiveness of the democratic control for which this Parliament is responsible depends on it.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you know how much I appreciate your actions and everything you are doing. The issue we are dealing with this evening is important. It happens that I was rapporteur for the directive on payment services in the previous mandate. I therefore know how important it is to work towards harmonising payment services across Europe. This evening, allow me simply to discuss one issue which angers people: multilateral interchange fees. From the beginning, I have defended these fees and I had the opportunity to do so when we launched the first SEPA transfer in 2007. Interchange fees are legitimate. What is not legitimate is setting them at rates which are excessively high. Why are these fees legitimate? They are legitimate because payment services are a commercial service. The institutions, that is, banks or payment institutions established under Title II of the directive I mentioned just a moment ago, must undertake commercial activity. It is therefore normal that they should receive remuneration. This must obviously be justified by the service provided and, from this point of view, interchange fees — it is true — were, for a certain period of time, set unduly high. However, today, things have changed and the situation we are arriving at thanks to this new text, this regulation, is something of a paradox. Firstly, this text regulates an issue which was under discussion in the Court of Justice of the European Union; it authorises interchange fees at national level until 2017. It bans them sooner for cross-border operations but allows interchange fees to operate if payment is refused or rejected. None of that is very consistent. We must not let what has been done this time serve as an example for the coming regulation on bank cards. Reflection must be better led in this area and the fact that only six countries have resorted to using interchange fees does not mean to say that they are useless. Why? Because otherwise there is no transparency; we would pay for payment services using other means of payment, for example, cheques. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Madam President, Commissioner, Ms Matera, may I say, first of all, that we fully support Ms Matera’s line of argument concerning whether or not the decision to end the crisis derogation was justifiable, and I would like to thank her for all the work she has carried out in this area. I also share your view, Commissioner, on the disastrous impact it will have on the EU’s image if this measure is stopped despite its proven effectiveness. I should like to return briefly to the Renault case – and I also speak on my behalf of my colleague Mr Riquet, who is unable to be here today for personal reasons – in order to say that I also share your assessment of this issue. This case has had its ups and downs, no doubt due to the fact that two aspects have been mixed up: the question of which measures are eligible under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), and the strictly French issue of voluntary early retirement. As you said, there has been a kind of overlapping between the initial agreement and pension reform in France, which extended the period during which workers have to contribute, leaving a number of workers – the number of these varies, as does the time frame – concerned about their future. We share that concern, and it so happens that both Mr Riquet and I are deputies for the constituencies where the affected Renault factories are located. I can assure you that we have spared no effort in trying to encourage Renault to see reason. Just yesterday, I spoke on the phone to the head of the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Health, who read Renault’s commitments to me. I believe they are serious about those commitments, but I can guarantee that, at local level, we will make every effort to make sure that the workers affected by this pensions problem – which you said is not directly part of this issue – can see a proper solution to their situation. On the basis of these observations I would call on all my colleagues to grant this assistance to Renault. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 I did not realise that this was what the Commission was proposing. My understanding is that the Commissioner said that he regretted this decision and was going to ensure that borderline cases could be studied in accordance with the criteria in force, but taking account of this crisis situation, which, he said – it seems to me – was going to continue and was going to continue to affect unemployment, unfortunately. That is why I said just now that I was in full agreement with the analysis of the Commissioner and the rapporteur on these matters and that this decision by the Council conveyed entirely the wrong message and gave Europe a very bad image in a difficult period for workers.

 Explanations were given to me just yesterday afternoon by the French Ministry of Labour, the Minister of which was taking steps to enable progress to be made on this issue under, it seems to me, less than pleasant conditions. The issue of pensions has in fact arisen in other French companies and has been resolved, notably at Michelin, for example, which does not come across as an allegedly left-leaning company. What is shocking – and I want to make this clear here and now – is that Renault, 17% of the capital of which is held by the government, has expressed some reservations. However, yesterday I wanted to make sure that these commitments had been made. These commitments – which were read out to me over the telephone, but which I did not get in writing – aim to ensure that people who do not receive an income because of an increase in the necessary contribution periods as a result of pension reform in France can have their contribution shortfalls compensated for, in particular through offers of temporary work. However, on humane grounds, this solution does not seem to me to be very satisfactory. That is why I said that, at local level – because I am in contact with the prefect of the region, and I am fully prepared to work with Ms Grelier to resolve this issue – I believe that, despite our political differences, we both have the same concern that workers who lose their jobs, who entered into an agreement contractually concluded when the situation was different, do not have their rights eroded because of subsequent changes to the legislation. I am perfectly willing to fight this fight, along with Ms Grelier, but I hope it will not come to that. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, of course, I shall say, like most of my fellow Members, that the Polish Presidency has been a success, and has worked effectively over a difficult period. However, contrary to what has just been said, perhaps the high point of this Presidency is the speech looking back over it that you have just given, Prime Minister. You encouraged us with utmost lucidity and a sense of realism – let me remain within the atmosphere of yesterday evening’s Polish Christmas dinner – to examine our consciences. This is something that we do less and less. Everyone shows their satisfaction, self-satisfaction or indulges in self-praise while you, today, asked some hard questions. However, the European Parliament also needs to examine its conscience. It is not enough to demand greater powers, greater cooperation and greater presence. We, too, have to be capable of a rapid and effective response if we are to survive within our institutional environment. I think that we shall have the opportunity to do so over the next few days with the growth report. I happen to have been tasked with the own-initiative report and we are going to suggest that Parliament be allowed to intervene and make proposals in relation to the Commission’s proposals, either to support them or to suggest new approaches. Today, the time has come to have a renewed democracy and Parliament must have a place within it. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this work that has just been done deserves to be highlighted and also deserves to be recognised for what it is. The work that has been done is an example of excellent cooperation with the rapporteur, Ms Berès, and I believe that tomorrow’s vote will show that it expresses the will of the vast majority of this House. Why is this the case? Because at stake here is the democratic scrutiny of procedures aimed at improving economic integration and cooperation among States. Clearly, Parliament is not asking to be an executive, nor is it asking to take the place of the national parliaments. However, everyone has a part to play at his or her respective level. The merit of this own-initiative report, which is perhaps a little longer than normal, is that it proposes practical solutions for this association, by adopting two points of view. Firstly, the point of view of the current Treaty, of the current rules. The rapporteur makes proposals on how to increase Parliament’s involvement so as to ensure democratic scrutiny. However, the report also reflects on the possibility of amending the Treaties and, at that point, indicates the improvements or the changes that should be made to guarantee this effective democratic scrutiny, which guarantees the legitimacy of the measures taken and negotiated at European and individual Member State levels. I should like to return to two specific points that were raised a moment ago, starting with the subcommittee on the euro. We have abandoned it so as not to create a divide among MEPs, but this report rightly points out that, when the time comes, Parliament will have to adapt to the structure adopted by the Member States within the Council or within the euro area. There is also the quasi-legislative, or quasi-codecision, issue. We must be practical and implement, on the basis of the Annual Growth Survey, a mechanism that allows Parliament to give its opinion, vote on amendments and, as the rapporteur was saying earlier, ensure that our President has a proper democratic mandate. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, Mr Juncker, I obviously agree with what was said by Mr Daul, Mr Langen and Mr Mauro, so I will not go back over the same ground. I want to talk to you about something else, about what citizens understand. Last night, I was with a hundred or so citizens who were asking me about the crisis, as, unfortunately, it is one of the issues that I am dealing with. What we need to do now for Europe is win the citizens over and, above all, get them on side. You have two categories of citizens: those who give in to the lure of populism and who scream and shout ‘Europe is a failure; Europe is good for nothing’; and then you have all the other citizens, larger in number, who say ‘We expect a lot from Europe, but Europe is not convincing us in what it is doing’. It is therefore our job to convince these citizens together. What is more, I say convince the citizens before convincing the markets. I have heard endless talk about the markets; I know the markets and I know them professionally. Has nobody ever told you that the markets will never be satisfied? They will always ask for more. There is a change of government in Italy, and now they are saying that it needs guarantees that it will do this or that. When it has done this or that, they will ask it to do something else. The politicians need to regain control. The markets are useful. The economy needs them. They allow it to work. However, they should not take advantage. When I see the Commission back down, yesterday, on the credit rating agency project, on innovative proposals which, in my opinion, did not go far enough, this is no way to convince the markets. This is proof that we are all weak, that we give in to those who put pressure on us, forgetting that we are here to serve the citizens. You can count on this Parliament. I have just heard that Mr Schulz endorsed the ‘Six Pack’, which he did not vote for. That just proves that here, once you have voted, you are able to follow the Commission, to help it. Mr Barroso, you have just said ‘Help us!’ Does Parliament not help the Commission to move Europe forward? Then let us all be courageous and brave together. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, I note from the Commissioner’s speech that the Semester has been a success. I can only be pleased about that. With Europe in the throes of a major crisis, this tool, as it is called, needs to help move the situation forward. I should like to address, in particular, the Council representative. It took you 16 minutes to explain the mechanism, which we were familiar with, and to tell us that all this is very technical, that it is ultimately too much for one to understand and that, if Parliament wants to be informed, then it is in luck, because it can consult the documents that are updated for the general public online. You might also tell us to read the newspapers, which we do as a matter of course. I find it quite shocking that the only response to the question that was asked about Parliament’s role in the European Semester was that we should read the newspapers and search the Internet and we will learn just as much about it. You know, when we meet our fellow citizens – and I wonder whether you ever have cause to meet them yourself – they ask us: ‘What is Europe doing with regard to these issues?’ Until now, we would tell them: ‘Ah, we have developed the European Semester!’ Well today, the European Semester is a damp squib. That is what I wished to say to you, Mr Dominik. The method that has been applied excessively for some months now is certainly not one that will enable Europe to overcome the crisis. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, what we need to do is to restore confidence: to restore the confidence of the public, to restore the confidence of economic operators, and to restore the confidence of the markets. We will not convince the markets by endlessly proposing to increase the funds mobilised for bailouts. On the contrary, we will weaken our position. We will not convince the markets by announcing, day in day out, measures that are not enforced. We will not convince the markets by showing that the banks need to be recapitalised but not indicating how or why. We will not convince the markets with rules that, once decreed, are not applied. This is the case where rating agencies are concerned, Commissioner. The three main rating agencies are still not accredited, are still not supervised, and continue to put an excessive strain on the financial markets. It is therefore time to do something to convince the markets, Commissioner. The European institutions need to solve the real crisis, that of policy making. It is up to the President of the Commission and you to adhere strictly to the principles that you have defined and with regard to which you have the support of Parliament.  (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Mr President, a few days ago, I told you, in a friendly way, a number of things. You have not missed today’s opportunity. We heard – at last, I would say – these strong words that are necessary if we want to address the political decision crisis that we are in, for beyond the economic, financial and social crisis that you described, and the confidence crisis, there was and is a political decision crisis. By asserting today loud and clear the Commission’s role and its constructive proposals – of which some have already been implemented, on financial regulation in particular – and thanks to this Parliament, thanks to what will be voted for later on I hope, and thanks to the joint work that we will once again undertake – like Mr Schulz said earlier on – I think that we can make Europe move forward in the right direction and give you all the support you need, and that, henceforth, you fully deserve. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).  
– (FR)
 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Minister, the current uncertainty over the EU’s response to the crisis is particularly harmful, firstly for the countries concerned, but also for the markets, on which the pressure is becoming unbearable and dangerous. I would like to raise a purely technical issue in relation to this point. Since we recognise that a Member State may default, it is now crucial to define rules to govern this situation. When a business becomes insolvent, there are exceptional rules to protect it. However, there are no such rules for Member States, because it has long been accepted that Member States cannot default. Yet, the example of Greece clearly shows that constant pressure on a Member State prevents planned measures from being implemented effectively. It follows that the European Union must decide, within the framework of the euro area, which rules shall prevail. Membership of the euro area creates an original and ambiguous situation for every Member State: it is no longer the one issuing its currency, but its financial policy is still out of sync with that of the other countries. Clearly, the first imperative is the rapid completion of the economic policy coordination arrangements and of the European Stability Mechanism, but we also need to establish the rules that will apply in this area. In the case of countries under arrangements with the European Union or the International Monetary Fund, this would involve introducing provisions to freeze clauses concerning early repayment, forfeit of terms or credit events, which are today standing in the way of a genuine recovery. Introducing such provisions would ensure both transparency and credibility. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to use an image much loved by the Commissioner, this is a new brick in the regulatory and supervisory system that he is courageously and effectively putting in place. A new brick, and soon there will be another one, with short selling. To ensure that those bricks are firmly in place, however, we need the Council’s agreement, and that is why I believe we should make the most of the coming days in order to try to make a success of a trialogue that will enable us to reach a decision at first reading. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is in favour of postponing the vote on the legislative resolution until the next part-session. Doing so will give the negotiators time to reach a proper agreement. As Mr Langen, who has done a remarkable job in this difficult affair, said, this agreement specifically deals with the role of, and supervision by, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). ESMA is a key element in this financial regulatory system that has been established. The conditions must be in place, at European level, for that authority to carry out all aspects of its role, which is very important in this case. On the issue of scope, we support the rapporteur’s proposal to limit it to over-the-counter derivatives and their markets; it is also important to consider the issues of interoperability and of third countries. I would also point out that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in an effort to be practical, believes that there is no point in imposing the provisions retrospectively, except, perhaps, in the case of transactions that are carried out over a long period of time. This system is difficult and complicated, but it is vital if we are to prevent a repeat of the financial crises we have gone through. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I have a comment and a request to make. My comment is to emphasise that, thanks to Mr Stolojan’s work, we have been able to reach an agreement at first reading; I hope that this dossier will encourage the Council to successfully conclude the negotiations on the three other dossiers. Then I would like to ask you, Mr President, to give the floor to Mr Bodu. He mixed up the texts before and was supposed to take the floor on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs. I am making this request as coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, having listened to this debate as a layman, I think that we need to show some common sense in this affair. When crises occur, the citizens are the ones who directly or indirectly pay the consequences. I believe that when they realise the absurdity of selling something that one does not own, or of insuring against a risk for which one is not liable, they understand that this is an inappropriate system. I believe that we should try today to apply some common sense to this complex financial legislation, so that the human spirit is back at the heart of this work, instead of computer programs that are all configured in the same way to ensure that, when ridiculous transactions take place, no one really understands what is going on. I believe that Parliament has adopted some reasonable positions, and I hope that the Council will support them. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of this text is clearly to protect private investors from the fraudulent or deeply flawed practices of investment firms. This text is designed to increase confidence after a crisis in which retail investors, as you said, Commissioner, were definitely the most vulnerable stakeholders and the ones who suffered the most. It is important to understand that this text provides for the payment of compensation as a last resort. It is not paid out on an ad hoc basis, but as a last resort. That is why our committee unanimously adopted this report, which seeks to fully harmonise the rules and to increase the ceiling to EUR 100 000. In the specific case of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), the Commission’s feeling was not that measures to protect investors should be overlooked, but that this very specific product, which, incidentally, has an excellent reputation, deserved its own rules to be laid down as part of the revisions of the UCITS Directive. That is why the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has asked your Commission to undertake a study to discover what the advantages and disadvantages would be of extending the scope of this Directive on compensation for private investors to include UCITS. It is now up to the Council to agree so that the text that we adopted at first reading – since we will also be voting on the legislative resolution – can quickly be applied. I repeat: for Europeans and private investors, there is also a feeling of belonging to the European Union which must take the form of equivalent protection for all. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, many comments have already been made on the different reports that make up this governance package. What are the most important points, at this stage, to help us appraise the work that has been done? The fact that we have this package today, which is the result of negotiations between the Council and Parliament, already constitutes considerable progress. It fills an obvious gap in the development of the euro, and sadly it took the debt crisis to prompt us to do this. In this respect, we should stress the commendable work done by the Hungarian Presidency and the quality of the negotiators from this Parliament. I would also like to emphasise the results that Parliament obtained in the discussions with the Council, as the latter demonstrated genuine openness. We must remember how the situation used to be and measure the improvements objectively. Having said this, are these provisions satisfactory, and are they enough? There is always room for improvement, of course, but this package already provides real solutions to strengthen the euro area and to create the concerted economic approach that is needed. Can we seriously argue, as the opponents of this package do, that we can build growth on top of a mountain of debt that is continuously put off further and further into the future? To those who blame us for supporting a governance package that is not based on any theoretical or econometric model, I will simply say this: did the models you are talking about foresee or prevent the crisis we are going through and that has not ended yet; or did they lead, instead, to high-risk behaviours under the cover of mathematical truth? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow Parliament will have to make its decision, and I hope it will send out a signal loud and clear, both to our citizens, to restore their confidence in Europe, and to the markets, to stabilise our currency. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I rise on behalf of Mrs Lulling and Mr Langen, too; they had their own speaking time, but I assure you that I will not use it all up. I would just like to point out, as every one of you has done here, that the process of selecting a new Managing Director of the IMF has begun. It is important for the European Union to express a unanimous and strong position that is conveyed not only by the various Member States, but also by the Commission, and you have pledged to do that, Commissioner. Many of us in this House, with the exception of Mr Farage, are very keen to see the balance – a popular one until now – between the United States and Europe maintained during the process of appointing the Managing Director of the IMF and the President of the World Bank. We fully understand that emerging countries – particularly the largest ones – would like more of a say in the IMF’s decision making. It is important, therefore, to continue the reforms under way regarding the governance of that international institution, and particularly the ones that you also mentioned, Commissioner. However, it is definitely too soon for any radical changes to the balance achieved as a result of the Member States’ respective financial contributions to the Fund. Only one European candidate has launched a proper campaign by making contact with the various Member States. That candidate – who, by the way, is a woman – has the qualities required. Her skills, political experience, moral authority and perfect command of English, coupled with her experience of working across the globe, make her the ideal candidate for the post of Managing Director of the IMF. As has been said, the Managing Director must be someone who seeks consensus and is effective at a time when the institution has a vital role to play in helping to redress the economic and financial balance with a great sense of purpose. Our Union must therefore do whatever it takes to secure Christine Lagarde’s appointment. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, as you acknowledged just now, last year’s tests have not had the anticipated effects. We ought to avoid the same errors of conception and implementation. The fields of investigation must be consistent and similar. There will be no stabilisation if the diagnosis is not correct. Governments must be aware of that. This being so, the tests must quite clearly be realistic. The solutions that you have just given us, in a particularly detailed fashion, are of a kind that can provide an answer to our questions. It is now the job of the European Banking Authority, in supervising and examining the conclusions of these tests, to give a first test of its effectiveness. The tests must allow us to better define the potential recapitalisation needs of the banks and to take the measures that you have just mentioned. However, performing credible stress tests is the best way to calm the financial markets and to limit the influence of credit rating agencies and the negative effects of their decisions on the whole of our economy. The credibility of the results of these tests can end the dependency on these agencies, or at least can reduce it. The supervisory authorities have no choice but to ensure that the tests are successful; that is, that they provide convincing evidence. Let me use my allotted time, Commissioner, to draw your attention to the fact – in my opinion, a serious one – that the legislation relating to credit rating agencies, which has now entered into force, has not been applied, and that the authorities to which these agencies submitted their files did not take steps to inform them of the requirements of the agreement. We planned a transitional period pending the establishment of the European Securities and Markets Authority, yet today we are continuing to act as if nothing had happened. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, after the remarks that I have just heard, which are unworthy of this House, I should like to tell you that the majority of us believe that the EIB’s action is very positive. The improvements made by the Treaty of Lisbon provide new scope for action, which should help the EIB to become even more effective and to provide relevant solutions to the global financial crisis. As you emphasised, the EIB provides real support to small and medium-sized enterprises and makes a crucial contribution to the EU’s cohesion policy convergence objective. Those actions must be pursued and, if possible, increased. The EIB must do more to promote strategic investments in Europe, and so I should like to invite you to support those who have taken initiatives to improve long-term financing and, in particular, deposit and consignment offices − the caisse des dépôts
 and cassa dei depositi
 − and KfW. I believe that they should be supported, because the banking regulations and accounting regulations that are developed today do not encourage us to factor in long-term investment and penalise those who opt for it. Moreover, contrary to what is often said, we need changes and not just adaptations. Long-term financing is, as you also said, essential in order to open up a new horizon for Europe. Outside the European Union, you are right to say that the EIB must act as a driving force and hence must propose initiatives, in particular, for the financing of the Mediterranean countries. In the current turbulent conditions affecting a good many of those countries, the EIB can make a useful contribution to economic development within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean through its targeted financing, and can thus help to establish democratic civilisation in those countries whose future is still uncertain. I have noted your willingness to make that contribution if the Union asks you to do so, which I hope it will. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I agree, of course, with what Mr Brok said. I should just like to draw attention to two points: the important thing today is to have legal certainty. In other words, there should be no ongoing debate regarding the legal bases of action that may be taken at European level, whether it be intergovernmental or Community action; our preference, of course, is for Community action. Why do we need this legal certainty? Because Europe and the euro area are under constant pressure from the markets. We cannot destroy the markets but we can try to bring them under control. To do so, we must eliminate uncertainty, the decisions that are put off each day, and we must stop constantly wondering whether or not we can take decisions. It is therefore a matter of urgency, Commissioner, for you to heed Parliament’s requests and for us to quickly amend the Treaty so as to guarantee this legal certainty, which is necessary in order to respond effectively to the difficult economic circumstances we are facing. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, I regret that there is some confusion in this report by Mrs Podimata, which raises a number of important issues with regard to innovative financing. I would like to ask the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament to withdraw the alternative motion it has tabled so that the joint drafting work that has been carried out can be concluded. Secondly, I regret that a slightly artificial opposition has emerged on the issue of a tax on financial transactions and that there are two very similar amendments. I regret that, as a result, Parliament cannot express its overwhelming support for this tax in conditions that are reasonable with regard to Europe’s competitiveness. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot but endorse what has just been said by Mrs Goulard on the basic presuppositions that mean that while we are well aware of the need for effectiveness and speed in the decision-making process, it is essential for Parliament to be involved. This is the only way in which our fellow citizens, of whom we are the elected representatives, can understand what is happening and explain it to them. I would like to raise one very specific point. We are buffeted, on a daily basis, by the financial markets, these financial markets, which stand for everything and for nothing, are most often inhabited by young people who have moved from Game Boy
 to computer without thinking too much about it, and yet who strike fear into the hearts of our countries. The way to bring the markets under control is not to eliminate them. I do not belong to a group that seeks to abolish the markets. However, what do the markets seek? They seek to avoid risk and the rule of the game in the markets is to pass risk on to someone else. This means that an operator will never feel happy as long as there is risk. I feel that if we are to have an impact on these financial markets, Europe must be able to draw some very clear lines, not change direction every other day, and not bubble with hosts of ideas which are never, subsequently, put into practice. If we want to bring this financial aspect under control, and this is vital for the economic stability of our countries, we need to be able – and it is your role, Mr Barroso, to provide this impetus – to set clear goals, clear measures and to show a clear determination in regard to good economic coordination. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to make two comments in relation to form: the rapporteur has just acknowledged all those who contributed to this report. This work was indeed a real team effort, in which our group member, Mrs Hübner, was particularly involved as shadow rapporteur. However, I have learned that the socialist group has submitted an alternative resolution, which means that a document on which there has been no consultation shall be put to the vote first. My second political comment – I do not usually make such comments – is that we are creating an artificial opposition here, especially with regard to the tax on financial transactions. The position of our group is clear: we are in favour of such a tax at global level; we are in agreement with it being trialled in Europe if it cannot be trialled globally. We simply feel that we cannot rush into this kind of decision without carrying out a thorough impact assessment in order to verify that the competitiveness of Europe’s financial centres will not be affected. In this regard, Commissioner, I would like to state clearly that the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is not to play for time, or to put matters on standby. We urgently and strongly request that the impact assessment which we have repeatedly discussed in this Parliament be duly and promptly carried out to allow us to make an informed decision on the matter. I think that, on the one hand, there is the hype which the opinion columns in some European newspapers serve to create, and, on the other, there is the real situation, where we have to manage this issue seriously by having a thorough knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages and making a political decision as quickly as possible.

 Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, I will address an issue that has been raised on several occasions and often presented as a single reason: speculation. I believe that, with regard to speculation, moderation is required. It is clear that there is a definite link between certain financial activities and increased volatility and prices for raw materials. However, looking at the entire issue solely in terms of financial speculation would certainly be a mistake, since part of what we call speculation is actually the legitimate hedging of prices on the part of producers and, as we are well aware, these producers could not do without this hedging possibility. However, a situation must be avoided in which direct investment in commodities has a harmful impact on price volatility because of its massive scale or its purely speculative nature. In this regard, the proposals made by Commissioner Barnier on financial matters, in particular the regulation of short selling and derivatives, and also the revision that is going to come from the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), must give Parliament the opportunity to take account of aspects of commodities speculation in financial regulation and supervision, which will be put in place to ensure that those markets are also regulated in an effective yet pragmatic manner. Commissioner, you said that these efforts should continue, and I believe that Parliament which, in a financial crisis, has complied with and, sometimes, anticipated what the Commission proposed, will live up to its responsibility. Finally, I welcome the declaration of the Hungarian Presidency indicating that Europe would support the French Presidency of the G20, which has made the regulation of the commodities markets one of its priorities.

 Madam President, Mrs Győri, Mr Barnier, this debate right now is not a legal debate; it is a true political debate. It is a debate on the future of financial regulation in Europe. It is the culmination of one aspect of the work conducted by Parliament, with the Council, under the guidance of the Commission. I am therefore going to be quite clear. For us, it is not about indulging in some sort of revolution or showing our biceps just for fun. It is about ensuring that the spirit that presided over the agreements between the Council and Parliament is, in fact, respected. It is not a lesson in law. The texts do not matter. We know the texts. What matters is the way in which these texts will be put into effect. In this regard, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the clarity of his speech. We have never sought to call the Commission into question, and the words spoken by the Commissioner are totally in accordance with the wishes of Parliament. We are talking here about a political act that consists in saying: ‘These institutions have been established, so we must give them the concrete resources to function properly.’ Yet, I think that we do not simply have doubts but also suspicions about the way in which these provisions have in fact been implemented by a number of Member States, by those that wish to unravel European supervision and prevent financial regulation at European level. That is what we are speaking out against, because we believe that, if that had been the case, we would have been cheated in the negotiations on supervision. The negotiations were long; they were difficult. Everyone made compromises. The Belgian Presidency did some remarkable work and the Commissioner provided extraordinary impetus. Today, we could be faced with institutions without effective power: due to the low status of the staff appointed; due to the fact that the Member States did not choose the best, and perhaps because the salaries were not attractive. In any event, today Parliament needs a concrete answer. Minister, I am bound to say that, despite the friendship that I feel for you, having sat on the same bench, in the same group and on the same committee as you, the letter, which I have seen and which, I admit, is only a first draft, is inadequate. I will give you the response of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is simple. You say, on behalf of the Council, that you fully endorse what the Commissioner has just said. I can tell you that, for us, this will be a satisfactory declaration. The statement made by the Commissioner is precise. It deals with problems of human and financial resources. Your letter needs to state: ‘We agree with virtually everything the Commissioner said’. Mrs Győri, this is very important. We agree with virtually everything the Commissioner said in plenary this evening. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I have listened to this long debate as a citizen. I would say that Mr Barroso’s proposals were very interesting. We would like to see them acted upon. A clear and comprehensible political will and a discourse of truth are the necessary conditions for restoring our citizens’ confidence. It is imperative that we do not mask realities. There is public spending, which we must cover or reduce. There are public and private debts, which we must repay. There are numerous experts who have ideas on everything. Those who did not see the crisis coming are now full of brilliant solutions. But in a difficult situation, let us use common sense. Let us not reproduce in the management of public finances the mistakes and errors of the private sector that led to the financial and banking crisis. Sophisticated arrangements do not create value and wealth. They create illusions and often benefit only the speculators. The fact of the matter is that the Member States have lived beyond their means. We must have the courage to draw the necessary conclusions and ensure that the burden of recovery is apportioned fairly. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, this is a purely technical amendment, to take into account the date that the regulation establishing the European Securities and Markets Authority will come into effect and the fact that this regulation can only come into effect at a later date. We should consequently adapt one recital and one article of the text on which we are going to vote. In recital 22, we should cut the second sentence and in article two, I also suggest that we cut the second sentence. This oral amendment has been the subject of an item of information and an agreement by the different groups that signed the compromise agreement. This text we will be voting on today completes the regulation of rating agencies and is part of the European Union’s policy to improve the regulation of financial services. I should like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Barnier and the Belgian Presidency for their very strong involvement in this issue. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, here we are in the third act of the financial legislation for 2010. Following supervision, following the directive on alternative investment fund managers, we are once again looking at credit rating agencies. I say ‘once again’ because Europe has not been slow in bringing in a regulation in this area which was conceived in 2009 and which is now taking effect. Credit rating agencies, in general, issue opinions, literally in the form of ratings, on the creditworthiness of businesses and states and on complex financial products. The rating reflects an assessment of the risk of issuers of financial instruments not being able to honour their debts. These agencies have gradually become very important in the financial world, for a variety of reasons. First, ratings are taken into account in banking regulations in order to determine the amounts of own funds that will be used to back investments. The second reason is that ratings have been a factor in the success of issues, since they have become a major indicator for investors. Yet, although credit rating agencies were not the main cause of the recent financial crisis, they did have a harmful influence. Indeed, they underestimated the probability that issuers of certain complex financial instruments would default. Faced with the need to restore confidence in the markets and to strengthen protection for investors, in 2009, the European Commission proposed a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies. Thus, in the same year, Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies was adopted. During the debates in the European Parliament preceding the adoption of this regulation, your rapporteur stressed the need for EU-wide joint oversight of credit rating agencies’ products and integrated supervision of them. At the time, European supervision of this type was legally impossible. However, the Commission undertook to draft a legislative proposal along these lines, and you, Commissioner, kept this promise. The agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament on the architecture of European supervision, which will enter into force on 1 January 2011, now makes the effective implementation of rating agency supervision possible. It is stressed in the Regulation establishing the European Securities and Markets Authority that this authority will exercise its own supervisory powers in relation, in particular, to credit rating agencies. That was the objective of the additional amending regulation on which we reached an agreement and on which we will vote tomorrow. What I wanted – and my colleagues supported this request – was for the other issues relating to credit rating agencies, allocation of sovereign debt, remuneration schemes and competition, to be postponed and dealt with in a study taking the form of an own-initiative report, which will precede the legislative proposal that you are due to make in the first half of 2011 and for which you have launched a consultation. I believe that, by establishing European supervision of credit agencies, we are taking a big step along the same lines as the supervision arrangements that have been implemented. I now want to thank the Belgian Presidency for its tireless efforts on the financial dossiers, you and your teams, Commissioner, and, obviously, my fellow Members in the European Parliament who participated in this study and who supported our positions. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, after the comments that you have heard, you can draw two conclusions. The first is that Parliament will overwhelmingly support this report tomorrow, which will show once again that Parliament, or a large majority of it, appreciates the actions on regulation and supervision that are being taken by the Commission and which have been strongly supported by the Belgian Presidency. The second conclusion that we can draw is that I will not come to a conclusion today, but that a new debate will open up, on the basis of this consultation, of Mr Klinz’s own-initiative report, to examine all these difficult questions. Thus, we cannot avoid the fact that in 2009, when we brought about the first regulation, we were already asking ourselves these questions. If we have not dealt with these questions, it is because we have not found an appropriate response. I hope, therefore, that, thanks to the thought that is being given to the matter with the submission of Mr Klinz’s report, the discussion about consultation which is taking place will this time enable us to provide responses to complete the regulation on rating agencies. In conclusion, however, if you will allow me, I will repeat a phrase by the President of the Securities and Markets Authority, who said that, at the very least, it would be good if the financial markets detoxified themselves of the rating agencies to allow investors to gain a greater personal appreciation of situations and risks. I think that that would also be a guarantee. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, I believe that I have one minute if what I have been told is correct. President-in-Office of the Belgian Presidency, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to say, Minister, how much I appreciated your lucid assessment of the latest G20 and how supportive I am of your proposals for the future. I think it really must be said that the results have been fairly poor, even though Basel III and the IMF reform were approved. We can only hope, like the President of the Commission, that the Seoul summit paves the way for the implementation of the French Presidency’s ambitious proposals, which are justified by immediate need and the ongoing difficult circumstances. The European Union will need to be consistent if it is to carry the weight it deserves. Concrete results are essential, and I agree with you, President of the Commission, when you say that our fellow citizens are expecting action and not mere words or statements. The globalisation of the economy and finance require us to make real progress in the international harmonisation of regulations. Markets react much quicker than politicians. Europe must not be naive and must ensure that there is reciprocity. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).  
– (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, as the coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to emphasise two points in your programme. Firstly, strengthening economic governance and initiating the European Semester. We were pleased to welcome the package on economic governance. Achieving this target is critical. In this respect, our group would like to see effective and binding measures that go further than what is being proposed. It is also necessary for Parliament to be truly involved in finalising the processes envisaged and in their implementation. Legal bases should be found to prevent the treaties from being substantially amended, which would only slow down the implementation of measures that must be taken. The second point concerns the continuation of the work on financial regulation. The projects are on the table, or will be soon. 2011 will be a decisive year. We appreciate Commissioner Barnier’s pro-activeness. In 2010, Parliament showed its determination in adopting the supervision package, the directive on alternative investment fund managers and, in all likelihood by the end of the year, the regulation that will set up the European supervision of credit rating agencies. We want to continue on the path of a pragmatic, intelligent and effective regulation. That is what we are expecting from the Commission today. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Mr Trichet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, clearly, I join the chorus of praise for the ECB’s work, and I shall not repeat what my colleague, Mr Balz, said or what is said in the resolution. In the short time allotted to me, I would simply like to say that we must consider our fellow citizens. Why do I say that in this way today? Because, yesterday evening, on all the French television channels, a future presidential candidate made a spectacle of himself by tearing up a EUR 10 note that he had photocopied and enlarged, and showing that, by tearing up that note, he was tearing up the cause of all our ills. Of course, that is not true. All that is needed is for us to make an effort, together, to communicate. The work that has been carried out in terms of supervision, organisation and regulation, to which you have referred, Mr President, is excellent. You know you have Parliament’s support: you said so yourself. However, we have a real task on our hands with regard to those of our fellow citizens who do not understand the messages that are being conveyed. Every day, the headlines in the press are of increasingly grim solutions and unlikely situations, and I can tell you that, on Friday, when I was out in the field, as we say in politics, I saw nearly 100 to 150 people. They all asked me the same question: what is going to happen with the euro? The fear felt by our fellow citizens is out of sync with what is being done, and done well, by the European Central Bank. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the vote that you are going to cast concerns one of the key elements of Europe’s response to the financial crisis, namely, the regulation of alternative investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. This compromise document, this compromise text, has been long in the making. We have succeeded in reaching a broad agreement, and I should like to pay tribute here, before the ECOFIN President, to the Belgian Presidency, which has been directly and significantly involved in this matter, in particular, through the Minister’s active participation in key trialogues, and I should also like to thank Commissioner Barnier, whose work has been particularly useful. Lastly, I should also like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs, the Secretariat staff and the experts who assisted us. This work took more than 14 months, and there were 1 690 amendments. It was a lot of work, but I believe that today, we have come up with a text that, thanks to the Belgian Presidency, marks a significant step forward in the field of European financial regulation. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, the text we are debating this evening, and which will be put to the vote in Parliament tomorrow, is the result of a long period of work. On 30 April 2009, the European Commission published its proposal for a directive on alternative investment fund managers. It aims to establish a safe, harmonised framework at European Union level to monitor and supervise the risks presented by managers for their investors, their counterparties, other actors in the financial markets and financial stability, while making it possible for managers, subject to observing strict requirements, to provide services and market their funds throughout the internal market. Mr President, may I just pause a moment, I wanted to know whether, given the length of our work, I had no time limit, because I see that the clock has not started. It does not bother me but, for honesty’s sake, I wanted to draw it to your attention. Parliament received the text about 14 months ago. It has aroused obvious interest among Members of the European Parliament, as a record number of 1 690 amendments have been tabled. Professionals have been involved very extensively and the rapporteur has had nearly 200 discussions on this text, not counting the discussions with national authorities. Finalising the compromise text that is being debated today has been particularly hard work. Half a dozen informal trialogues took place under the Spanish Presidency during the first half of 2010 in order to facilitate the exchange of information on the progress of the work. No agreement was reached in the Council during this period. On 17 May 2010, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, by a large majority, voted in favour of the report, which was the result of collective deliberation by Members of the European Parliament. Parliament introduced proportionality, differing rules for different categories of funds, regulation to protect the private equity of target companies and jobs and a passport system for funds and alternative investment fund managers based outside of the European Union. There then followed a dozen trialogues. A working party was also set up between the three institutions specifically to deal with the technical aspects of the proposal in a number of meetings with the Belgian Presidency and the Commission. On 26 October 2010, the trialogue, which was to become conclusive, was held, with the active participation of the President of ECOFIN, Mr Reynders, and of Commissioner Barnier, and an agreement was reached on a compromise text which the rapporteur felt could be put to the vote in Parliament. I shall not go into the detail of this lengthy technical document but will highlight the essential points. The directive will make it obligatory for alternative investment fund managers located in the European Union to be authorised or registered, and to comply with operational and organisational requirements, codes of conduct and transparency rules, and will make them subject to the power of the competent authorities of the Member States and of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to supervise and to impose sanctions. It will give them access to the Union’s internal market by means of an intra-European passport to manage and market their products. Eventually, managers based outside of the European Union will be able to qualify for a passport provided they meet the same requirements as managers whose head office is in the European Union. The number of meetings and the intensity of exchanges and negotiations between the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, the Presidency at the time and the Commission have very significantly enriched the initial proposal in a number of areas. In this respect, I need to make it clear that the progress sought by Parliament was achieved gradually in the course of negotiations and not, of course, only in the last trialogue during which some adjustments were made, but at the political level, it was decisive. I would now like to emphasise the areas in which Parliament’s intervention has been decisive. First of all, on two highly political issues, with regard to relations with third countries, the existence and implementation of a passport – well, now I really do not understand because normally I have four minutes – for managers residing outside of the European Union have been approved. Specific conditions for the granting of a passport have been laid down. With regard to private equity, Parliament has succeeded in ensuring that the directive includes provisions to avoid potential asset stripping of the target company and also specific rules concerning reporting obligations in relation to target companies, their employees or their representatives. Given the erratic behaviour of the clock, I shall not go back over some of the provisions that were achieved in accordance with Parliament’s wishes. I shall simply say that Parliament would have liked to have gone further, but it was able to influence negotiations so as to give more recognition to the ESMA’s role. The solutions that were upheld nonetheless constitute significant progress towards improving monitoring at European level. Parliament has been careful to strengthen the powers of the Council and of Parliament in the process of adopting acts delegated by the Commission. A majority in Parliament would have liked very strict control over passive marketing, or even its prohibition. The inclusion in a recital of the principle whereby professional investors have to carry out due diligence when they invest in funds located outside of the European Union constitutes a significant first step. That, Mr President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, is what I wanted to say in opening the debate. In closing, I shall take this opportunity of two minutes to thank all those who have contributed to this success. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
rapporteur.

 Madam President, earlier, I spoke about the technical details. Allow me to use my last two minutes to express some richly deserved thanks: thank you first of all to all the fellow Members who have spoken today. My especial thanks to those who have said that they will be supporting the text, but to those who will not be voting in favour, I do not believe that putting me in the same bracket as Mr Cameron is really an insult either. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the groups: Mr Goebbels, Mr Bullmann, Mr Canfin, Mr Klute, and Mrs Regner, the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. I wanted to name them all in recognition of the incredible support that they gave me during the first phase of this process. We were able to work together productively, each putting forward his or her own points of view, and I would like to thank them for that. I am delighted that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the European Conservatives and Reformists have joined us now that a compromise has been reached and hence, I am delighted that Mr Klinz and Mr Kamall have co-signed with me the amendment that replaces the initial report. Particular thanks go to Mr Barnier for his considerable involvement in this dossier: he knows how much I appreciate him. I know that he knows that Parliament is relying on him and will support him in putting in place these building blocks that are so dear both to him and to us. I know it is unusual, but I would also like to thank Ugo Bassi, with whom I have had a very fruitful working relationship during this time, and so the text is also the result of work done within the Commission. As for you, Minister, earlier I felt that you contributed something when, in your thanks, you asked whether we would continue to make progress. So let me begin by thanking you, because without you we would never have achieved anything on the Member States’ side. These are genuine thanks, not simply a polite gesture – I believe that your personal commitment has been key to the progress made in the Council and to the fact that we have reached an agreement. You have also succeeded in ensuring that all the main groups can identify with parts of the text and in obtaining the majority that we both wanted for this directive. My thanks also for the contributions from our fellow Members on the left, without whose support the directive would not have the credibility that I am confident it will have tomorrow after a very broad vote. As you pointed out, this was vital for supervision, and vital for this directive too. I am also very grateful to your teams, Minister; please pass on my thanks. Some of the debates were pretty lively, but although I now live in Normandy, I come from the south, and sometimes my southern temperament wins out over the more balanced Norman approach. I also wanted to say, Minister, President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council, that I really hope that we will complete our work on rating agencies before the end of the year. For our part, we have the committee vote on 22 November, the vote in Strasbourg in December, and then, if the Council is ready, we will be ready. (Applause) Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Commissioner, in 1968, our fellow Member Mr Cohn-Bendit’s friends wrote, ‘words, not deeds’ on the walls of Paris. Today, citizens are asking for the opposite: deeds, not words. We are hearing a lot of words, but our fellow citizens are not seeing results. The European Union’s slowness to respond is not good enough given the imperatives we need to deal with. We need to move forward together, with a united European spirit. In this respect, I would like to say a word about the role of Parliament. Here too, there is still work to be done in terms of upholding the codecision principle. The President of the Commission thanked Parliament several times for its support, but Parliament is not here simply to play a secondary, support role, or to ratify decisions taken by the Council without having the chance to discuss them first. Parliament is on a par with the Council. It is time we recognised this, and the debate on economic governance will be a test in this respect. Finally, as regards the forthcoming G20 summit, the European Union must present a united front to ensure that this international body plays the role that is expected of it and does not merely indulge in endless talk. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, the Treaty of Lisbon unquestionably provides Europe with new social objectives. Sustainable development in Europe is based on the high competitiveness of the social market economy, which means full employment and social progress, the fight against social exclusion and discrimination, the promotion of justice and the eradication of poverty. The Treaty of Lisbon confirms the role of the social partners and promotes social dialogue between the trade unions and the representatives of employers’ organisations at European level. On these various points, the actual situation is certainly not the one described by some speakers here. Today, we can dramatise the situation; it is true that there are worrying situations, that the crisis is not yet over, and that it has consequences. However, Europe is taking measures in this area – which we must explain to our citizens – to create some order in the financial sector, in particular, and in this regard, it is one of the first to be making efforts to organise that sector, on the basis of our work. Allow me to make a few short remarks. On services of general interest in particular, I will say clearly that we should take specific national circumstances into account, because it is true that some of our fellow citizens are a little alarmed – I am thinking, for example, of the French – when they feel, wrongly, that Europe is endangering the public services which are a French tradition. Likewise, in relation to public contracts, we should take account of individual circumstances, and especially of those which allow for collaboration between several public authorities. Nevertheless, social policy is dependent on the health of the economy and on economic growth. That is the primary objective of a social market economy. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

 Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by briefly praising Mr Karas’ excellent work. I was one of the people who were in favour of an own-initiative report being produced before the Commission makes its proposals on the framework for transposing the Basel Agreement, and I am delighted that the work done by Mr Karas with the help of the various shadow rapporteurs has highlighted the main points for consideration. I will not repeat them here, Commissioner, and of course I welcome the points you make and your determination to ensure that this regulatory framework is effective and workable and above all that it creates no distortion of competition at international level. To move on to a different subject, I cannot help noticing that there is often a big difference between the statements that are made publicly and the commitment to these in practice. I also note that countries outside the European Union, and I am thinking of the United States in particular, have an irritating tendency to make value judgments about how we operate, whilst they themselves are not putting the systems into practice as they ought. As regards Basel, it is vital that European companies are dealt with on an equal footing and are not penalised more than US companies. In the United States, few banks are taking notice of these directives or of the Basel Committee and, at present, nothing is actually being put into practice. I would hate to see the provisions adopted in June to regulate US finance – the statements made about these exaggerate their real impact – being used as a legal basis for not applying the provisions which might be introduced by bodies outside the United States. Commissioner, I trust in what I know to be your total determination and vigilance to ensure that this does not lead to a distortion of competition for the French banks, the European banks, and for those who finance the economy in general. It is right that we should be steering the banks back towards their primary role of financing economic development, but we must make sure that they are not penalised disproportionately. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, I recall a few years ago asking the then Competition Commissioner whether she was aware of any evaluation being carried out on the effectiveness for consumers of fines set, and on this matter, the then Commissioner indicated at the beginning of our committee meeting that she had managed to claw back so many million euro in fines. And so the answer was that it had not been considered. It would appear that since then, you have carried out studies to find out what damages were actually incurred. However, I would like to draw your attention to two matters. The first being that prices are fixed on the basis of a group’s turnover. However, the company that may have violated competition rules, and I am not condoning it, may be a relatively small company within the group. That is what bothers me, especially when there are separate legal entities involved. Secondly, Commissioner, and it is you who said so and not your colleague, you often talk about the need for prevention, saying that prevention is better than repression and, in any case, more effective. So the question I ask is whether these huge fines, which always make the front page of the newspapers in which they are delivered, really have any role in terms of prevention. And I wonder whether it might not be more effective in terms of prevention to focus more on the number of checks rather than on the level of fines. As has recently been the case in France, sentences can clearly be passed for sums of money requiring 4 or 5 000 years to be paid off. I think that we should not become fixated on these figures. We need to look specifically at the repercussions for the company, at a time of uncertain economic circumstances. Skewing the rules of competition is not right. It is quite right that a penalty is applied but this penalty needs to be truly proportional, which is why we wanted to know whether or not the Commission would amend its rules. I think you said that this would not be the case, which is a shame. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Mr Van Rompuy, first of all, I would like to say how happy I am to see that, on the question of the Roma, the positions for resolving the problems of poverty faced by these populations are balanced, reasonable and forward-looking. I would like to say to you, Mr Van Rompuy, that I appreciated your way of presenting the achievements of these last eight months. You presented them with vigour and precision. We do not say enough about Europe’s work, and neither do we say enough about the part Parliament plays in it. You spoke just now of collaboration, in particular, as it relates to supervision. This is good, because Parliament wanted agencies with a true European competence, which this supervision was able to introduce, because, as you know, the position of the Ecofin Council in December 2009 was much more reticent on this question. We must continue, at a time when the G20 will have a European Presidency, via France. We must say more, and we must say it stronger, with one voice. We must also have specific proposals for the future. We are counting on you, Mr Van Rompuy. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Madam President, Mr Reynders, Commissioner, I would, of course, like to add to all the congratulations offered and I would like to underline the work done and the excellent collaboration within this Parliament and also to remind you that without the will of Parliament, this supervision would certainly not have had the European characteristics that it has today. As far as the future is concerned, Mr Reynders, before the end of this period and perhaps even before the end of this month, I would like us to be able to reach an agreement on one of the subjects that concerns us to which you have dedicated yourselves, and not in vain I can assure you. In the coming days, thanks to the great minds of the Belgian Presidency, we will find a satisfactory solution on hedge funds and private equity. To repeat one of the Commissioner’s analogies, I think that we must add bricks to this framework that has just been outlined that will ensure that financial regulation is intelligent and affects all products. It is not about regulation for regulation’s sake. It is about trying to ascertain the effectiveness of regulation that is intended to limit as far as possible the risks inherent in the financial system. In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Mr Wright who regrettably is leaving us. We hope that after all the work he has done to help Parliament achieve results, we will see him again soon on the European way. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, first of all I should naturally like to add my congratulations on the good result obtained in the area of supervision. As Mrs Goulard reminded us, Parliament’s effort has not been in vain, and in December something new and unique happened: a statement was issued by the four coordinators of the main groups saying that Europe needed to play a greater role in this supervision. Thanks to your dynamism, Mr Reynders, a good solution has been found. The Commission has clearly worked hard, and I welcome the financial services programme announced to us by Commissioner Barnier. It is fortunate that this happened, that this agreement was reached, because the EU’s financial credibility, its financial credibility in the eyes of our fellow citizens who, since the crisis have been asking us, ‘What is the EU doing? What concrete results have you achieved?’ is ultimately at stake. We can tell them that we are thinking about and working on this issue, that we are holding trialogues and meetings, but what they want is results. The EU’s credibility in the eyes of our international partners, particularly the US, is also at stake. I have recently been in contact with representatives from the US finance sector and, ultimately, what bothers them about the EU is this impression of legal uncertainty: we change regulations; we introduce revision clauses and sunset clauses; we do not build anything solid. I think that legislation must be definitive, albeit subject to amendment. We must not, above all else, give the impression that we are going to amend the texts two or three years down the road. Madam President, Mr Reynders, I should like to plead on my behalf: a very important trialogue will take place this afternoon with Commissioner Barnier and my colleagues on the regulation of hedge funds. It is essential that we find a solution soon. I am very conscious of the commitment on the part of the Belgian Presidency and of your personal commitment. We must reach an agreement over the next few weeks, so that next time you report on ECOFIN’s work, you will be able to say, ‘An agreement has been reached on the regulation of hedge funds.’ We are counting on this, and I know that you also are counting on it. We must now take the final step so that the right solution can be found. Jean-Paul Gauzès,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, credit rating agencies were a matter of concern to this Parliament at the end of its previous term, and I should like to highlight in this regard the responsiveness of both the Commission and Parliament, which has adopted a regulation on credit rating agencies. Today, we are raising this issue once again because of the observations that it has been possible to make about the role of credit rating agencies during the crisis. They can be criticised for not having seen the crisis coming, they can be criticised for the volatility of their ratings and for their untimely decisions in announcing their ratings, especially when they relate to sovereign debt. Nevertheless, I believe that we must examine this issue with a clear head. Firstly, the fact that credit rating agencies rate products that they have submitted to investors is not, in itself, shocking. Investors who invest, who provide funds, are entitled to try to discover the risks or the difficulties that may arise, just as they are entitled to try to discover which ratings are good. Where the situation becomes slightly more ambiguous is when these ratings are used, in banking regulations, to determine the amounts of own funds that banks must have in exchange for some of their investments. From this point of view, the 2009 regulation does not really provide a solution since the idea was to provide for both the approval and the supervision of credit rating agencies. Therefore, a rating may be legitimate, but is it legitimate to issue ratings as the agencies do? I believe that the texts that you will propose – I would emphasise, Commissioner, that you have just submitted the text on the introduction of European supervision of credit rating agencies within the framework of the new financial regulation – must enable a solution to be found to these issues, especially that of competition in the field of credit rating agencies. From my perspective, I do not think that simply confirming the creation of a European agency, even if it is public, solves the problems. If the idea is to have an agency that issues ratings in a kinder, more generous fashion than the others, it will not be of much use. More questions need to be asked, in my opinion, about the conditions in which the agencies issue their ratings. There are ratings of private enterprises, and there are ratings of sovereign debt. I shall emphasise the ratings of sovereign debt. The authority which, at Parliament’s request, will be responsible for monitoring and supervising those agencies that will operate in Europe is ESMA, the new financial services authority. I also think that the powers conferred on ESMA should include the possibility not only to supervise the agencies effectively, but also, as regards sovereign debt, to provide for a facility by which to monitor, though not censure, the way in which credit rating agencies issue sovereign debt ratings. We cannot allow a situation – and such situations have indeed arisen – in which, 15 minutes before the markets close, an agency downgrades a country, thus giving rise to completely undesirable consequences. In fact, what needs to be done is to implement a preventive system that will force credit rating agencies to inform the supervisor, within a very short timescale, if need be, of the conditions in which they envisage issuing ratings so that the supervisor can verify both that the standard procedures have been followed and, above all, that the conditions in which the ratings are issued will not adversely affect the situation as regards, in particular, sovereign debt. The debt of businesses is not the same as that of states; it deserves to be treated differently. That being said, some people have mentioned the Court of Auditors, but such courts do not exist in every European country, and they are not all independent. That, Mr President, Commissioner, is the thrust of our questions. How can we improve the operating methods of credit rating agencies and, above all, the dissemination of information, and how can we improve competition? Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial situation in Europe fully justifies the drastic measures which have been taken, in particular, to stabilise the euro area and to avoid the undermining of our single currency. The urgency of the situation justifies the practical approach adopted. However, when it comes to implementing the adopted measures, it should be ensured that Parliament is involved, within the scope of its powers, and can exert its democratic control in appropriate conditions. Indeed, we must ensure that our fellow citizens do not lose confidence, and can regain confidence, in the political institutions. Without such confidence, no structural reform or acceptance of the necessary austerity measures will be possible. Faced with the financial crisis, Europe has not been inactive. We do not say this often enough. In 2009, we drew up and adopted regulations on the credit rating agencies, the implementing provisions of which will be published very shortly by the Commission. Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted a few days ago for the package on the supervision of financial activities. Last Monday, the same committee adopted the report on regulation of hedge fund managers by a large majority. Trialogues have been initiated to seek an agreement with the Council. This agreement must be obtained rapidly, so that our institutions retain their credibility. Our fellow citizens often ask us: ‘What is Europe doing?’ We must meet their expectations. In this regard, I should like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on your determination, and to encourage you to continue with the work programme which you have set out, in accordance with the undertakings made at your hearing. Your ambitious but essential timetable has our support. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with you so that the necessary regulation of financial services takes place. This is not a question of bullying the finance sector, but of establishing the rules to ensure that an activity which should be regulated is regulated, and of making transactions more secure and transparent. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis we are experiencing has forced public authorities to intervene financially using public money. Under these circumstances, it is tempting to consider the implementation of a tax on financial transactions. The income from this tax would be used, for example, to finance the recovery and to develop a sustainable economy, and could initially serve to offset the cost of the crisis borne by the real economy and the taxpayer. This tax would be added to the regulations governing the financial sector, the elimination of tax havens or even the regulations currently being drawn up for derivative products. At this stage, it would be advisable to evaluate the effects of a tax on financial transactions. That is the main purpose of this oral question: to encourage the Commission to examine in practical terms the various points listed in the draft resolution in order to give an opinion on the feasibility and timeliness of such a tax. Commissioner, what you have just said is a step in the right direction. It should, however, be stressed – as you have done – that this measure will have to be approached in a realistic and pragmatic way. Such a tax must not be harmful to the European economy or to the competitiveness of the European financial industry. More generally, it is important to underline the consequences of implementing this tax in the European Union alone, as some people are advocating, if no agreement were possible at international level. We believe that this sort of purely European solution cannot be countenanced. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group. 
– (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I do not doubt your determination, and you have, in the points that you have just covered, already answered most of the questions we were going to ask and that are raised by this resolution. I will simply remind you that the difficulty of the subject stems from the fact that the single euro payments area (SEPA) is an initiative of payment institutions, particularly banks. Also, may I say that the purpose of the directive on payment services, for which I had the honour of being rapporteur, was specifically designed to enable us to identify and define the legal instruments needed in order to put this European payments system in place. Another purpose of the directive was to improve competition in the area of payments, and Title II made provision for the creation of payment institutions, which were intended to break the monopoly of the banks. This complicated beginning certainly explains part of the delay, but it is certainly also true, as you have said, that payment services establishments – that is, banks – have demonstrated a certain reluctance to implement this mechanism. There is an explanation: the cost. I am sure you already know this, but to give you an idea: in France, for example, the cost of implementing SEPA is higher than that of changing to the euro. There has also been the matter of interchange fees, which deserves to be tackled. There are two issues involved. The first, as you mentioned, is that of conformity to the rules of competition, but the second issue, which must not be neglected, is that the payment service is a commercial activity for payment institutions which must, therefore, be fairly remunerated. What has been condemned is the possibility of setting interbank margins unilaterally, arbitrarily and without consultation, when these rightly appear excessive. Commissioner, we are counting on you to ensure that the progress we have made with the creation of a single-payments market can result in the swift implementation of European tools for transfers and direct debits. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
).  
– (FR)
 Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with many of the arguments put forward by Mrs Thyssen, Mr Karas and Mrs Castex. Nevertheless, I ask myself the following question: following the compromise that we have managed to reach, allowing national options to survive, must we block this directive which constitutes a positive sign of simplification for micro-entities? If I may, Commissioner, I would like to make a non-committal proposal. First of all, I would suggest that Parliament must support Mr Lehne’s proposal and that you take into account what has just been said about modifying other directives. In that way, we will very quickly reach agreement: accounting rules for small businesses, and a European system in that area. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, President, Commissioner, like Mrs Wortmann-Kool before me, I am, of course, going to tell you that we approve of the positions adopted by the Commission to deal with the current situation in Greece. As regards the Spanish Presidency, we are pleased to note the objective that you are setting yourself to improve the coordination of economic policies. This strong political will must also be applied in order to see through two current and important projects: the structuring of a genuine form of financial supervision and the regulation of hedge funds. True, Europe must not be a fortress, but nor must it be a sieve. In both these areas, the Presidency really must have room to manoeuvre so that it can negotiate productively with Parliament. We expect the Council, at its next meeting, to send out a strong signal to the public and to the market: to the public to restore confidence in the euro, and to the market to show its solidarity with Greece. The Council must give a strong indication that it will not let itself be overawed by the attempts to destabilise the euro made by certain speculators who have no hesitation in speculating against those Member States that are currently facing economic and social difficulties. Jean-Paul Gauzès,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the commissioner’s comments just now genuinely answer the question that was asked. The European Union does not make funds available without conditions. Those conditions have been mentioned: quality of public spending, sustainable development objectives, employment policy, climate change, but also, of course, the need to make up for the shortfalls of the previous administration as quickly as possible, so that these countries that we are helping can reach the level required. However, in a crisis such as the one we are going through, I believe that we must not go overboard with conditions. We must trust the governments of the Member States that receive European aid to implement the necessary provisions and avoid, as the commissioner said, provisions that could be retrograde or backward-looking. Social spending is, of course, important – it must be preserved – but here, too, we must trust the Member States to adopt the measures needed to rectify the situation and not carry out nit-picking checks, which would be ineffective anyway. The time to assess the way in which the Member States have used European aid will be when any new aid is granted, and it is then that we will perhaps be able to draw conclusions from measures that were unsuitable, particularly in the social sphere. Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome your determination. Europe has begun to put in place effective regulation, but Europe must not find itself isolated. Close international cooperation is necessary, and this is exactly what we expect of the G20. It must pursue the reforms, which were initiated at previous meetings, with rigour and vigour. The international framework for regulating the financial sector must be completed, so that it can aid investment, growth and employment. Guiding principles must be affirmed. The crisis is not over. We must not return to the situation ex ante and abandon measures needed to avoid, as far as possible, the renewal of crises which are particularly damaging to the real economy, growth and employment. The strengthening of supervision and regulation is equally necessary. The obligations for supervision should reflect the level of systematic risk that the financial institutions impose on this sector. Speculative activities, which represent a significant risk, should be discouraged by increasing the capital requirements and applying the Basel rules internationally. As for salaries in the financial sector, we should recommend pay committees, increase transparency of these salaries with stricter disclosure requirements and supervise variable salaries, notably bonuses. The strengthening of global financial institutions is likewise an imperative, as is the reform of governance and representation at the IMF. Commissioner, these are some of the expectations citizens have of the next G20, where Europe must speak with one voice, with determination and conviction. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

) Madam President, President of the Court of Auditors, I would like to start by thanking you and all of the members of the Court – including Ms Kaljulaid, who is here with you – for the work you do and in particular for the attention you pay to Members of the European Parliament. You pay us a great deal of attention and I really wanted to thank you for that. I would also like to thank Commissioner Šemeta, who, following on from the remarkable work of his predecessor, continues to improve the auditing of our accounts and the quality of special reports. I would like to apologise on behalf of my colleague, Bogusław Sonik, who has been detained by other parliamentary commitments. I too regret the absence of the Council, which is the budgetary authority. Mr President, this report comes too late. That is not your fault. I tabled amendments to the Financial Regulation to change the timetable. The European Commission must present the accounts before 31 March each year, the Court must publish its report before 30 June, and Parliament must vote before 31 December. It is inconceivable that today, in November, we should still be talking about matters concerning 2011. I suggest that the working group that I have proposed should meet to change this timetable. I would like to make a few observations: Article 323 of the Treaty suggests that Parliament should ensure that the necessary financial means are made available to the European Union. I wonder if the Court could not play a role in raising the alarm about the Union’s cash position: we have learned that we had a shortfall of EUR 9 billion and we are incapable of paying our bills. I would therefore suggest that the Court can help us to monitor the functioning of the Union. A final word about shared management: I think that we need to take another look at it here. I wonder about the independence of the audit authorities and about relations with our national audit institutions, and I think that the shared management system – which has proved useful in its time – should be re-examined. I wonder if we should not create our own finance function at Union level and get rid of this system of shared management, which contains a lot of errors, is very expensive and the efficiency of which merits re-examination.

 Firstly, I regret that the President of the European Council did not attend the debate. The crisis has caught up with the debate on the European budget. We argue: that is normal. However, we need an agreement; otherwise, we will be the laughing stock of the international community. Yes, we must support the European Commission’s excellent proposals. At the same, however, we cannot ignore the financial difficulties that many Member States are experiencing. In this context, I have a suggestion to make: we should maintain the overall multiannual ceiling proposed by the Commission and establish two separate periods. The first would last three years and we would agree to freeze appropriations to give the Member States time to put their finances in order and ratify the Treaty on Stability. During the second period, from 2017 to 2020, we would increase the budget slightly to reach the amount proposed by the Commission, and this would be financed, in particular, by the own resources established in the meantime. In 2014 we will have a new European Parliament, a new Commission and a new President of the European Council. In 2015 the United Kingdom might leave the Union. We could have a political debate on all of these matters when we come to the 2014 European elections. Jean-Pierre Audy,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control
. − (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, my first words will be to give apologies on behalf of Ms Ivanova, detained by other Parliamentary activities, who has entrusted me with summarising for you the report of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Our committee recognises that financial instruments are useful in creating multiplier effects and leverage effects, such as guarantees and tolls. However, we draw your attention to the recommendations of the Court of Auditors and its 2010 opinion on ownership of instruments, risk-taking, accounting, transparency and reinforcement of EU staff capacity to operate them. The second point concerns links with financial markets. We think that these instruments should only be used when there is no offer from the private sector, so as to avoid any distortion in financial markets. Lastly, speaking personally, I am sorry that the idea of introducing an obligatory user contribution was not explored, in particular for trans-European transport networks that need financing, particularly those are not immediately profitable.

Mr President, I want to say something about the interpretation of Rule 191 of the Rules of Procedure. As there has been no announcement, I gather that there has been no opposition to that interpretation. For the sake of democracy in our Parliament, I wanted to be sure that it had no retroactive effect, that it did not affect the current mandates and political agreements within the committees, and that this rule would apply to the renewal of future mandates in the parliamentary committees concerned. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we must reach an agreement if we do not want to be the laughing stock of the international community over what, unfortunately, remains a small budget. That agreement is difficult to reach, however. I would like to emphasise the need to establish a review clause for 2017. By 2017 the Member States will have had time to ratify the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance. The issue of public finances will be resolved, as will the issue of sovereign debt. In 2017 we will have a new Parliament, a new Commission and a new President of the European Council. Consequently, if we do not reach an agreement, let us open a political debate on all of the issues. In this regard, I would like to emphasise this review clause, which, in the context of this political debate, will allow us to set out perspectives that correspond to the European ambitions to which we all aspire. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I want to make a point of procedure to the members of the Conference of Presidents under your authority, Mr President. I regret that we did not have a political debate to prepare for this European Council with the General Affairs Council. I would suggest, and I hope you agree, President-in-Office of the Council, that you should come and prepare for the European Councils with us so that you can hear the political debates in this House. I was disappointed in this European Council: very little was said about growth; practically nothing on competitiveness; no proposals on a major infrastructure investment plan. Indeed, all we heard about it in the press was that agreement had been reached on the timetable for the banking union. When it comes to the proposals concerning the contractual relations between the Member States and the European Union, like some other speakers, I have a hard time believing them. Take the national reform programmes: France, under Mr Fillon’s Government, put forward proposals that were accepted at the June European Council, with the new President of the Republic. Where are the recommendations for each Member State? France had proposed reducing public spending, and reforming pensions and the labour market. I think that we need to monitor these country-specific recommendations. However, we can tighten contractual relations through convergence on social aspects; Article 155 of the Treaty provides for this. We must ensure convergence of minimum wages. The former communist countries have been members of the European Union for eight years. We must factor convergence of minimum wages into the price chain. As you said, President-in-Office of the Council, we need to restore confidence. We need to use politics to restore the confidence of the people. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE
).

Mr President, I should like to speak about those paragraphs which refer to Parliament’s organisation and its seat. Paragraph 86 [sic
: 87] states that Parliament believes that, like every directly elected parliament, the European Parliament should have the right to decide on its own seat. This statement is an error, Mr President, and I should like to request that, in accordance with the appropriate procedures, this error should be removed. Admittedly, the German Parliament, the Bundestag, decided, on its own account, to transfer its seat from Bonn to Berlin, but constitutional and political practices differ widely from one Member State to another. In the Member State to which I belong, the seats of the National Assembly and the Senate are determined by statute. Then there are the paragraphs which call for studies regarding the savings to be made. From the carbon-footprint point of view, a seat in Strasbourg is exactly the same as a seat in Brussels. As for savings, I believe that it is necessary to include a study of all EU seats: the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, the European Medicines Agency in London, the European Banking Authority in London, the European Patent Office in Munich, etc. If we are going to carry out a study, let us do it covering all the seats of the European Union rather than, as it were, deliberately singling out the European Parliament. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to express my regret at the absence of the Heads of State or Government. That is nothing against you, Minister for European Affairs, but there is no Head of State here, not even their representative, President Van Rompuy. Where is Baroness Ashton, attending the European Council meeting? Yes, we need a federation of nation States in the long term, Mr Barroso, and we support you on this matter. However, we must not forget a Europe of results. Above all else, we need a Europe of results. We need to keep an eye on our banks, our major infrastructure, on budget cuts, diplomacy and defence. I should like to draw your attention to social convergence. Look at the former communist countries. It is not eight days that they have been members of the European Union, but eight years. The minimum wage is EUR 200. We should be ashamed. We have the necessary legal bases – Articles 154 and 155 of the Treaty – and therefore wage increases should be achievable through social negotiation. Yes, we need to move towards a federation of nation states. However, we need less haste and more speed. If we were to hold 27 referendums, 25 or 26 of them would say ‘no’. Do not rush us; we will not move towards a political Europe without democracy. And we must consider the suffering of the people. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for all the competence, patience and vision that you have employed in performing your duties. I should like to make some observations on your proposals. Firstly, I am surprised that the Council is not here, because it is the Council which really should have presented this proposal to us. It is in charge of this matter and not the Commission. It is up to the Council to make this proposal for a specific mission of the Central Bank relating to prudential supervision. I agree with some of my fellow Members: this legal basis does indeed have the merit of being efficient, but I do not think it meets our fellow citizens’ expectations, as they wanted regulation at European level. Furthermore, I am puzzled about Article 15 of the proposal, which lays down sanctions, while the legal basis, namely Article 127(6), only provides for prudential supervision. We are told that managers will be removed or fines imposed of up to 10% of turnover. I believe that we should have this point checked. I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, for approximately the last four years, the Committee on Budgetary Control has, under this legal basis, been calling for regulatory supervision of the European Investment Bank, and it would be worthwhile for this regulation to extend to cover public banks, and particularly public development banks. Finally, I believe that, under Article 26 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, we could consider introducing a European policy on regulators, for, under this Article, the Union is entitled to adopt any measure it needs to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market – regulators for credit institutions, and also for insurance, which is not provided for under Article 127(6), and for energy and digital technology. In short, we must introduce a genuine regulatory policy for our European markets if we wish to achieve a genuine internal market. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Commissioner, finally, we have a European Council on growth. I am sorry that in December 2011, when the Heads of State or Government agreed on the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, the President of the European Council did not call a specific Council to look at growth, but we have got there in the end. I think that we need to call formally on the 25 states to ratify this Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which sends out a message of confidence and solidarity, in terms of both the markets and the people. I appeal to the political powers in France to honour the signature of the French Republic without delay. We have talked about growth, but I think that we also need to talk about competitiveness. We need to talk about the competitiveness of our continent: yes, we need a major infrastructure plan. We do not need EUR 10 or 20 billion; we need investments of between EUR 1 000 and 1 500 billion. We lack imagination when it comes to own resources. Why not establish compulsory contributions for digital measures, energy networks, roads, railways and water? I am proposing once again that we carry out an audit of public spending and pool military, diplomatic and research spending. Finally, on an institutional level, I was pleased that our Chair, Mr Daul, reiterated the suggestion that the President of the European Parliament be invited to the European Council. However, Mr President, the President of the European Council himself needs to establish a relationship with our Parliament. Since the establishment of a permanent presidency, we have had no contact with the Heads of State or Government. We need political dialogue at the very highest level with the Heads of State or Government and with Mr Van Rompuy, who is absent from this House far too often. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, as part of these discussions on Venezuela’s decision to withdraw from an inter-American human rights organisation, I would like to draw Parliament’s attention to the fact that very important trade negotiations are currently under way between two trade blocks, the European Union and Mercosur, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, and that Venezuela is a candidate for accession to Mercosur. That might appear a little irrelevant, but I believe that we, ourselves, cannot work with areas which do not respect a body of rules of law. We are clearly not going to interfere in the procedures for States to become members of Mercosur, in the same way that Mercosur has no right to intervene to decide whether Croatia joins the European Union or not. Nevertheless, in the negotiations between these two blocks, I feel that the European Union and South America should share in a common destiny. It would therefore be a very bad signal if Venezuela did not respect human rights, and that is an issue that this Inter-American Commission is meant to monitor. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Since there has been a permanent Presidency, we at the European Parliament no longer have any contact with Heads of State or Government. We are facing a problem which falls to the European Council and Heads of State or Government. I regret that we have no dealings with Mr Van Rompuy because the truth is that the Council convened tomorrow and one at the end of June is intended to close the European Semester. This is not exactly the European Council on growth that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) asked for as far back as early December last year. A few thoughts on the matter: firstly, we are no longer listening to advocates of zero growth. This is good news. Next, I reiterate the idea that we should examine the effectiveness of public spending. I propose an independent audit, conducted by the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors, to find out where we could make savings: 27 armies, yet no enemies, research programmes that have been funded 15 times without any coordination, hundreds of diplomatic buildings where the costs are not even shared. The second point of thought is competitiveness. A word that is not used enough. Firstly, the competitiveness of our companies (flexicurity, labour costs) – and this does not mean public spending and higher levies as proposed by Mr Hollande to resolve the problems of competitiveness that we face in Europe and France. Next, the competitiveness of the continent. Yes, we need a major infrastructure plan for roads, digital technology, space and universities. Finally, for struggling States, I suggest, in line with Jean-Paul Gauzès’ proposals, that we consider establishing hive-off vehicles, beyond ratios, with a banking licence, in other words, access to the European Central Banks (ECB)’s cash to help States recover. However, each State needs to pay off its debts. We are never going to get a political majority whereby the people of one State pay off another State’s debts. Each State needs to pay off its own debts. Lastly, Mr President, the speech on the State of the Union is woefully inadequate. I propose organising a Congress of the Union in the autumn, which would bring together Heads of State or Government, the European Commission, the European Parliament and national parliaments to ensure that the direction of the continent is in the interests of the European people.

 Mr Hoang Ngoc, you are talking about taxes and collecting taxes. I am talking about public spending. The experts tell us that, in terms of public spending at each of the three levels, in other words, European, national and regional level, which includes local authorities, if we were to take a close look at our public spending, without touching upon the issue of sovereignty, if we were just to look at how we can make improvements to pool our expenditure, we could save billions and billions and billions, which could be used to reduce debts and to make investments. I am not talking about taxes; I am talking about making savings in public spending. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, the Heads of State or Government are meeting in an informal Council. It was customary for the President of the Council to come and report on the Councils, even when they were informal. However, I believe you will take the floor at 19.00 – I also hope that they will let you stay for dinner so that the President of Parliament can stay at the Council – but has the President of the Council been invited? How can we explain why he is not coming to report on the Council, even though it is informal? Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 On the basis of the report by Portuguese MEP Vital Moreira, I voted for the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the 2009 regulation on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. On 28 July 2011, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) adopted the Appellate Body Report in the case ‘European Communities – Definitive Anti-Dumping Measures on Certain Iron or Steel Fasteners from China’. In the reports, it was found, inter alia
, that Article 9.5 of the Council Regulation of November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community was inconsistent with WTO rules. This legislative proposal aims to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings. I hope that the Commission and the Committee on International Trade have indeed respected the principle of reciprocity. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

I voted in favour of discharge to the Commission on the basis of the report by my excellent colleague, Christofer Fjellner, who has accomplished an immense task in difficult conditions. I do not understand why the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors do not work together enough. With regard to the consolidated accounts, it is not normal to present them with negative equity and not include the EU’s ownership over the Members States in terms of staff pensions, the debt for which is, moreover, provisioned as a liability.

 I did not vote for the proposal to postpone discharge to the Council proposed by the report of my Spanish colleague, Inés Ayala Sender. By mistake, I did not vote for discharge in the Committee on Budgetary Control. As last year, my intention was to do so. I note that the European Court of Auditors did not comment on the management of the Council. I am also disappointed that my proposal for a legal study of the power of the European Parliament to grant discharge to the Council was rejected. That would have identified, in particular, the consequences for discharge of the creation of the European Union as a legal entity by the Treaty of Lisbon. I think these debates between the Council, which thinks that, unlike the other EU institutions, it is not responsible for the use of the funds made available to it, and the statement that granting discharge to the Commission equates to granting discharge for the entire EU budget, including the parts of the budget used by the Council, are derisory. All these debates do not reflect well on the Committee on Budgetary Control. I hope things will quickly become clear. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, my first words will be to congratulate Ms Ticău on the tremendous work she has done in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on this eGovernment dossier. I would like to thank the Commission for its work. I should like to make three comments. First, we need assurance that we have the coverage that will enable us to use all these new technologies across the entire European continent. This is an important factor for the competitiveness of our continent. In the canton of Meymac, in Corrèze, of which I am the elected representative, and also in Limousin and Auvergne, not all of our territory is covered, and this is a real problem. We need to achieve 100% coverage within the European Union and the Member States. Secondly, government must not, under the guise of making life easier, become more complex. We, the citizens, are tired of excessive complexity and bureaucracy. Finally, I would like to make a comment concerning the siting of officials. These new technologies must enable officials to stay where they are and give them the possibility of teleworking with their central administration, thanks precisely to eGovernment.

 Considerable work has been carried out in the area of financial stability – congratulations! However, it is incomprehensible for Spain or Italy to borrow from the banks at 6% while the banks borrow from the European Central Bank at 1%. I propose that we create, within each Member State of the euro area, special purpose defeasance entities, with a banking license to manage bad debt that exceeds the ratios authorised by the Stability and Growth Pact. I propose a political debate between national parliaments and the European Parliament on savings to be made in public expenditure (e.g. armies, diplomatic buildings, research programmes) at three levels – national, European and regional – based on an independent audit which could be conducted by the European Court of Auditors and the 27 national courts of auditors. I reiterate the idea of a major investment plan of EUR 1 000 – 1 500 billion over the EU 2020 period and the creation of an investment section in the European budget. Finally, I regret that President Van Rompuy did not attend this debate, as there is an increasingly urgent need to convene a European Council meeting with only one item on the agenda – growth.

 Mr President, I should like to take the floor, on behalf of the French delegation which I have the honour of chairing, to talk about recital I. I shall read the text which refers to the deportation of Roma people by France and I would like to point out that it is inaccurate and that, in point of fact, some citizens were evicted from private land at the request of the owners and that, once they were on public land, they were offered the opportunity to return voluntarily to their State of origin. That is the truth of the matter and I am sorry that a wounding inaccuracy of this nature could have been written in a high-quality report, for which I thank the rapporteur for our group, Philippe Boulland.

Do you know that Nicolas Sarkozy does not want to get rid of Schengen, but, instead, to strengthen it? Do you know how the border between Greece and Turkey operates? Do you know that in truth, freedom cannot be exercised without security? Mr Swoboda, I have a question to put to you: do you believe that the Schengen provisions are properly managed – yes or no?

Mr President, Ms Reding, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday at 06.46, Strasbourg time, time stopped in Japan. In a joint prayer, the Japanese people turned their thoughts to those killed or injured by the natural disaster together with the serious nuclear incident at the Fukushima power plant. One year earlier, on 11 March at the same time, 06.46, an earthquake of 8.9 on the Richter scale caused the loss of the plant’s electricity supply. The reactors shut down and the emergency generators went into operation. Unfortunately, 55 minutes later, 14-metre high waves devastated the plant: 19 000 dead, 340 000 displaced persons, an earthquake and a tsunami produced the greatest nuclear disaster in the world. Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) I would like to thank you for your initiative and to say that the dignity and courage of the Japanese people, their government and the families affected are in our thoughts. We are thinking of them. This disaster led to a political debate, as you have pointed out, involving all sectors of the public. In the heat of the moment, some states decided either to shut down nuclear power plants immediately or to gradually phase them out. However, worldwide there are more nuclear plants being constructed than the number shut down, and so the issue is a topical one. Moreover, this disaster is just one in the list of increasingly frequent disasters worldwide. Who could forget the earthquake in Haiti or the Deepwater oil disaster? Commissioner, the European Union reacted immediately, and I would like to thank your colleague, Mr Oettinger. After the disaster on 11 March, the European Council met immediately, on 24 and 25 March 2011, and called for a comprehensive evaluation of the safety risks of nuclear power for all the plants in the European Union. The European Commission was asked to review the June 2009 directive on nuclear safety, and the programme was thus set up. Today, all the Member States have carried out their evaluations; we await a peer review and the European Council in June 2012 will make an overall assessment. The PPE Group would like thinking to focus on the following areas for improvement. Firstly, with regard to safety standards, the European Union and its citizens must be assured that we have the best safety standards in the world. We know that these safety standards develop in line with scientific expertise and that they must be continually amended and made binding upon operators in the sector. Secondly, governance must be reviewed so as to give greater independence to the national safety authorities. My third point relates to transparency. In this sector, transparency must be beyond reproach. All national safety authorities must make their documents public to ensure that their citizens are properly informed. Fourthly, we must review development and the technical criteria relating to the selection of sites where nuclear power plants are located. Fifthly, we must jointly improve emergency preparedness and response. I would like to remind Members of the proposal to create a European civil protection force. Sixthly, operators’ civil liability needs to be clarified. We must include all the costs of nuclear power within cost prices, including possible risks and the costs of decommissioning power plants, either through suitable insurance, or through own capital requirements. Seventhly, the full costs should be included – sorry, I just said that, in relation to risks and decommissioning. Eighthly, I would like to mention scientific training and research. On this point, I welcome the Commission’s proposals to extend the Euratom research programme by two years. Worldwide, we will not be able to resolve our problems concerning energy and competitiveness, maintaining our lifestyle while tackling global warming, without addressing all these issues, which are necessary for the operation of nuclear power plants throughout the world and, in particular, for maximum safety.

 Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Šefčovič, I am having trouble getting used to the fact that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, it is the General Affairs Council that prepares the European Council meetings and it is you, Mr President, who wishes to participate in the European Council. I propose that President Van Rompuy be invited to prepare European Council meetings. I would like to discuss three ideas, primarily with regard to making savings, but specifically savings in the sense of avoiding public spending. I propose that we consider pooling the resources of the European Union and the Member States, starting, for example, with an audit by the European Court of Auditors, in partnership with our 27 national courts of auditors, on the savings we could make. Twenty-seven armies, more enemies, research programmes financed 15 times over without coordination and hundreds of diplomatic buildings for which we could guarantee management for 10 years. Finally, for growth, we should return to this idea of a major investment of EUR 1 000 to 1 500 billion in the Europe 2020 strategy. I also think we are not working enough on social convergence, with minimum wages that are not progressing. What hope do our people have if we fail to factor into the price chain a return to social convergence? Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, President of the Commission, let us start by talking about economic and financial subjects; you have stated, Prime Minister, that Denmark did not envisage being involved in the economic integration of the euro area. Could you reassure us of the swift implementation of legislative proposals on derivatives and the two regulations which must accompany the overhaul of the Stability and Growth Pact? We really do need these texts. Majorities – particularly a political majority – are forming on the tax on financial transactions; could you give us your exact political position on this matter? Next, I should like to draw your attention to trade policy. It is the Council that gives the Commission the mandate to negotiate on the Union’s behalf. It is a competence of the Union, and we, the European Parliament, have a new political competence to approve treaties on trade. I should like to draw your attention to the need to avoid being naïve and the need to apply the principle of reciprocity; for example, will proposals on negotiations with Mercosur be exchanged at the end of your Presidency? I would advise you to be very careful. Finally, with regard to growth, when President Van Rompuy came to tell us about the last European Council, I proposed holding a special European Council entirely dedicated to growth. You are a Member of the European Council, with a special position. President Schulz wishes to be invited to the European Council; will you support us on the presence of our President at the European Council and on the need to have a true European Council dedicated entirely to growth? I wanted to talk about social convergence but my speaking time has run out. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution of 14 December 2011 on the impact of the financial crisis on the defence sector in the EU Member States. I am committed to defending the notion that a common research policy can, and must, be an essential component in building an industrial base for defence. In the absence of a common European industrial defence policy, the defence market has become very fragmented in terms of demand, supply, regulations and standards. I am pleased that, at my behest, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, having been asked for its opinion on this report, took the view that a European industrial defence policy would be valuable in reinforcing the European Union’s role on the world stage and maintaining Europe’s technological capacity, while also taking into account the specificities in each Member State. Cross-border and transatlantic industrial cooperation can facilitate access to new technologies, promote advanced product development and encourage the adoption of effective measures to reduce costs. The financial crisis means that it is not viable to build a European defence industry at a national level. I welcome the work done by Mr Danjean, as Chair of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence.

 I voted in favour of the resolution of the European Parliament of 14 December 2011 on the next EU-Russia Summit. I regret the fact that my proposal of January 2011 to invite the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, to speak at a formal sitting of the European Parliament, which was accepted by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), was turned down by the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament. The Russian Federation is an important neighbour. Five Member States of the European Union share a border with it. Between Europe and Russia, there have been centuries of relations marked by remarkable successes, but also immense suffering. Our common history is indisputable. It derives from the evolution of our respective peoples, the rise and fall of empires, the links between the royal families, culture, the arts, writers, religions, especially Christianity, military combat against fascism, positioning in respect of communism, and so on. Today, Russia has been overtaken by the success of China and is rediscovering its Western roots. It is and will be the essential link in the dialogue between the West and the East, which will serve as a basis for political negotiations aimed at establishing future global governance.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, I should like to begin by saying a few words about currencies. The 19th century was dominated by the pound sterling, the 20th century by the dollar; in the 21st century, we have no idea how currencies will be organised. This was one of the issues tabled by the President of the G20. We have a duty to manage our currency. Traditionally, we had one currency per State. We are experimenting with a currency for a region, a supranational currency. The creation of this economic area of 26 States is good news, Presidents and Heads of State or Government. Hungary has changed its mind, and Denmark is uniting with the euro area even though it was not obliged to do so. This is good news! The United Kingdom is a major European country. We know why it has not joined the euro area: because of its financial services industry, as you said, Mr President. It is also because, in reality, it does not want the financial transaction tax, on which a political consensus is in the process of being reached. The second piece of good news concerns financial stability. All of our great democracies, with the exception of Greece, which is a special case – the conclusions say as much – have changed their government, have taken serious measures in relation to financial governance. We are putting plans in place to ensure the financial stability of our continent. This is good news. I do not believe in such a thing as contagion. We have to consolidate the golden rules and reform our Stability and Growth Pact. There are two issues that have not been resolved. The first is growth. Mr President, I believe the time has come to hold a special European Council in order to examine growth conditions and the terms of a major European investment plan. The second issue concerns the huge disappointment of democrats. Contrary to what was written in Ms Merkel and President Sarkozy’s letter, there has been no mention whatsoever of a parliamentary dimension. The Heads of State or Governments’ failure to add a parliamentary dimension to economic governance is plain wrong! I suggest you do something about it.

 Mr President, I share your point of view. I did not understand the question, but I think that we are in agreement, Mr Koumoutsakos. I think that the issue to be dealt with concerns the broad guidelines on growth set by the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States. That is why I would reiterate my proposal: a future European Council should set broad guidelines on growth. In truth, we know what the two broad guidelines are. The first, as the Commission President mentioned, is a major plan for investing in infrastructure via project bonds. The second is an internal market that can be more than 27 national markets, with flexicurity, and in which we will find the one or two growth points that we need, both to pay off our debts and to finance social progress with the economic prosperity we will create.

 Mr President, we are in the process of holding consultations on the nominations of the Members of the Court of Auditors. I would remind you that the Court of Auditors of the European Union is composed of 27 Members. Under Article 286 of the Treaty, the Members shall be appointed by the Council after it has consulted Parliament. Today, we are holding a consultation, which will be referred to the Council. Therefore, the governments are the ones that propose candidates, and the European Parliament provides an opinion. There is a total of eight candidates, proposed by eight States: Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Sweden. Four of those States – Belgium, Italy, Denmark and Spain – have recently seen a change of government. Two States – Denmark and Spain – with elections, and two – Belgium and Italy – without. In one of those four States, the Kingdom of Spain, the political forces have changed – I was at the summit of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in Marseille – whereas the other three States have made no demands. On the subject of Spain, the Spanish political forces have asked me to request that Parliament postpone the vote – as is possible under Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure – in order to give them time to assess the situation. The King of Spain is due to appoint the government next week. The request being put to our Parliament is to postpone the vote, and it has come from the PPE Group, Mr President. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 I voted in favour of revising the multiannual financial framework to address additional financing needs of the ITER project. The figure stands at EUR 1.3 billion. My first words will be to commend the huge effort made by Alain Lamassoure, Chair of the Committee on Budgets, to gather everyone’s views while emphasising the European interest and that of the European people. Like the generations before us, we know that we will overcome the challenges we face by drawing on mankind’s scientific expertise. This is the case where energy is concerned. Furthermore, there was an urgent need to send a message to our international partners on this remarkable project telling them that we can deliver on our commitments. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to congratulate the rapporteur, my friend Jean Březina, on his excellent work. The European Council meeting of 4 February 2011, known as the EU ‘Energy’ Council, adopted an ambitious European energy policy, intended to assure the people of Europe that they would have safe, sustainable energy at the best price, whose supply would be guaranteed and which would contribute to Europe’s competitiveness. This policy, born out of the Europe 2020 strategy, provides for investment in the development of low-carbon technologies. Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are included in these energy technologies that we Europeans must maintain, develop and implement. We must do so all the more since we are the undisputed and world-recognised leaders in this field thanks to our businesses, our universities, our engineers, our specialist workers and our research centres. I should like Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, to congratulate the European Commission, for having quickly tabled this proposal on 7 March 2011, before the tragedy at Fukushima. I should like to support this proposal for five reasons. First, it aligns the schedules for research programmes with the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013. Second, it stresses safety, which is an essential component of the confidence that the operators of this form of energy have a duty to provide to our fellow citizens. We are pleased that the Union can continue to invest in the area of safety, which is evolving with advances in science and the expectations of our fellow citizens. Third, this proposal allows us to maintain our status as world leaders in the nuclear sciences. Fourth, we are supporting our universities, our research centres and, notably, I want to emphasise this, the European Joint Research Centre, all of which are doing a remarkable job. Finally, it allows us to resolve a part of the cost of the ITER project, which is going to demonstrate the industrial feasibility of producing electricity by nuclear fusion. This will allow us to honour our international commitments to our partners in the ITER project – China, the United States, Russia, Japan and South Korea. Well done, Commissioner, you have our support and thanks. Jean-Pierre Audy  (PPE

 Mr President, my first words will be to echo the compliments made to the Court of Auditors, to President Caldeira, and to Commissioner Šemeta. I am disappointed that the Council is not here, since it is the second budgetary branch, and I join my colleagues in saying that within the shared management, this is where we have the highest error rate, and the Council is not here to discuss this. Need I remind you that we refused to grant discharge to the Council? The least we could expect is that this institution be here today. I would like to say a few words on the DAS, which is the statement of assurance. This is an obligation under the Treaty. I would like to know, Mr President, Commissioner, whether we have a positive or negative DAS. I should also like to congratulate Ms Kaljulaid for her work in presenting the DAS opinion. Regarding the annual accounts, we have an unqualified certification opinion. I must say that I cannot get used to the fact that we are not entering in the accounts the EUR 30 billion that Member States owe us in respect of pensions, in application of accounting standards in the public sector. On the underlying transactions, we have two opinions and one observation. I therefore believe that we need to make progress so that we in Parliament know what is the general opinion on the accounts and underlying transactions. Finally, I think that the number of tests is far from enough: Two-hundred and thirty-eight in agriculture, 90 in outside access. I believe we need to analyse whether this number of tests is sufficient and once again, I would like to reiterate the proposal whereby the European Court of Auditors relies on national courts of auditors for its opinion on shared management, as authorised by the Treaty.

 Mr President, President of the European Commission, President of the European Council, I would like to welcome you as you are a great European democrat and European democracy finds its expression in this House. This House is your home. I would like to make two or three comments. Firstly, we are not in a crisis of the euro. The euro is not the problem. The euro is the solution. We are not in a crisis of Europe. Europe is not the problem, it is the solution. The problem is the indebtedness of Member States. You have protected the financial stability of the Member States at the level of the euro area and the European Union, and I thank you for that. We should ask ourselves the following question: what would have happened had we not had the euro? The franc, the escudo, the peseta would all have been devalued by between 10 and 35%, the Greek drachma by 40%, and the Deutschmark would have been re-valued by 20%. Let us reflect on this question and recognise that we are extremely lucky to have the euro, which is a solid currency, with vast foreign exchange reserves, which are respected on a global scale. The truth is that we are making progress towards greater European Union and, as the European Council of 23 October stated, towards a growth strategy with the single market. We shall enter the G20 summit with our heads held high. As Jean-Pierre Jouyet has written, too bad indeed if the financial markets end up imposing political Europe in an example of major historical irony. It is very good news that we are making progress towards this political Europe that we all want. Jean-Pierre Audy,

 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, my first words must be to congratulate our rapporteurs, Ms Gräßle and Mr Rivellini, as well as the rapporteurs for the groups, who have all done important work. The first thing I want to mention is simplification, and I would like to thank both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for having moved towards simplification. Both citizens and central and local government bodies are at the end of their tether. Every time we see an increase in the error rate, it is because the rules are too complicated. I warmly thank you, therefore, for the Cohesion Fund resources, and for the research that has been done, continuing on from Mr Carvalho’s excellent report. I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for having agreed to introduce a measure of consistency, by allowing the use of international accounting standards applicable to the public sector in future. We had to put an end to this inconsistency whereby the EU’s accountants made their own rules. Thank you also for having looked into shortening the timescale for granting discharge. It is only given after 16 months, which is far too long. I will end by mentioning two other subjects. The first is the national declarations: I have a lot of reservations about these. I believe we ought to discuss the matter from both the political and technical points of view, to make sure that these declarations are in keeping with international auditing standards applicable to the public sector. In auditing, we never ask for declarations of assurance from managing authorities. We ask them for representation letters stating that nothing has been concealed, but not letters of assurance. It is not the job of ministers to perform audits. What is more, in the Member States that have agreed to the principle, the error rates are no lower than in other countries. To conclude, I would like to thank the committees for having agreed to the principle of an investment section within the European Union, in order to keep investment operations separate. We will at last be able to have a budget framework for our major investment projects, such as GALILEO or ITER, which are planned over periods that go well beyond the annual framework, or even the financial perspective. Another significant step forward that is within sight in terms of budget presentation is the inclusion of the future project bonds in our accounting system, and the establishment of a major European investment plan to help growth within the Union.

 Mr President, well done Mr Barroso, you have a balanced and apt view of the seriousness of the situation and of the common solutions that need to be found. I have listened carefully to the criticisms on the methods. Today, in this House, there are notable absentees: our Heads of State or Government. I have the following dream: that we would have a great political debate on the state of the Union, with the European Commission in its entirety – that is the case – representatives of the people, Heads of State or Government with their representatives, and President Van Rompuy. I would like to ask the heads of the political groups: did we invite Mr Van Rompuy? Did we invite the Heads of State or Government, as well as representatives of the national parliaments? There is a European Council on 17 October. It will be a momentous political moment. We must put your proposals on the table, Mr Barroso, we must have a big political debate with President van Rompuy, who could prepare this European Council session, at our mini part-session in Brussels on 13 October.

 A modern and effective infrastructure is of key importance for achieving the Europe 2020 objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as reducing unemployment, through the completion of the internal market. To this end, the Commission has proposed a ‘Connecting Europe Facility’ (CEF) for the next financial framework in order to accelerate infrastructure development in the fields of transport, energy and information and communication technology (ICT) networks, with particular emphasis on strategic cross-border aspects. In addition to equity instruments and grants, the CEF includes a new financial instrument to mobilise more private sector funding, as well as project bonds. However, the initial report by the Committee on Budgets and the subsequent negotiations with the Council focused on a limited number of issues including, for example, defining project bonds and evaluating the facility. Nevertheless, I welcome the proposals made in this report, which encourages projects in the fields of transport, energy and trans-European networks. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 Launched in 2009, the Baltic Sea macro-region brings together a coherent set of territories that want to cooperate in order to find better solutions to the economic and environmental problems facing them. This cooperation has taken the form of a ‘macro-regional strategy’, designed to coordinate the existing extensive sectoral cooperation and based on four pillars – environment, prosperity, accessibility and security – and an action plan setting out 15 priority areas and 80 flagship projects. The entire Mediterranean basin shares the same natural environment, and its shores are connected by the same history and culture. Significant opportunities exist in southern Europe, which cannot be seized without the coordination and overview permitted by the definition of a macro-regional strategy. In terms of developing potential, maritime traffic must be placed at the heart of a transport strategy for the whole area, particularly for goods. The report also underlines the possibility of boosting the southern dimension of the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy, taking on a concrete territorial dimension which would guarantee greater management of migration flows and impact positively on the performance of the economies of the countries concerned.

 For the majority of the European Union’s neighbours, in other words, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, the EU is the main export market and the main source of imports. Therefore, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area is the most important and most effective instrument at our disposal for strengthening our trade links. The gradual dismantling of trade barriers and regulatory convergence in areas that have an impact on trade are rightly included in this Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. Beyond the economic aspect, free trade areas can be a core component of a wider political agreement, leading, in particular, to an association agreement. The rapporteur also stresses that, with the signature of agreements and the creation of the free trade area, the European Union might also provide its assistance and strengthen the role of civil society or even steer reforms, both in the public and private sectors. My vote in favour of the Ransdorf report applauds its social and democratic goals, which are fundamental aspects of our partnerships. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 On 30 September 2011, the Board of Governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) voted in favour of the necessary amendments to the agreement establishing the EBRD to enable it to expand its region of operations to the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. The report by Mr Binev explains that, in response to the political and economic situation in the countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean, the EBRD has developed a phased approach to the start of its activities. This report gives the European Union much more room for manoeuvre in its cooperation with the countries surrounding the Mediterranean. In fact, the EU representatives in the EBRD should encourage the bank to contribute to the transition towards open market economies by promoting social inclusion and energy efficiency, while taking into account the social, poverty, civil and human rights context. My work at European level has exactly the same goal: that of helping and supporting the Mediterranean countries during their democratic transitions following the wave of revolutions associated with the Arab Spring and during their political and economic transitions.

 The European Union is the principal donor of development aid, the principal investor and the second largest trade partner in Latin America. Latin America has not been hit as hard by the financial and economic crisis as the European economies, with a +4.5% growth outlook for 2012. Unfortunately, 180 million people are still living below the poverty threshold in Latin America. It was therefore important to define a new cooperation with Latin America, in particular, by changing the tools to help this cooperation. Indeed, as the rapporteur recommends, the focus should be on the gradual withdrawal of bilateral aid to middle income countries (MICs) in order to reinforce aid to low income countries (LICs). Faced with the humanitarian and health situation of Latin American countries, it is vital that essential services such as education, training, health and hygiene, removed by the European Commission, are reprioritised. Finally, and as a driving force behind the future of this cooperation, regional policies need to be stimulated in order to reset budgetary and fiscal policies. I voted for this report in order to highlight the need to shift the focus of regional cooperation policies onto urgent health and humanitarian matters. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 As the world’s largest importer of energy, it is now time for the European Union to define a European energy policy in order to provide more effective guidelines for energy use, both within and beyond our borders. The report emphasises, in particular, certain key concepts such as better coordination, diversification, energy sustainability/viability and stronger partnerships with supplier countries. Priority is given to important areas such as the major energy networks and infrastructures, strategic dialogues and international partnerships. It is also important to be able to exchange information, with the establishment of a platform for that purpose, and learn about European and third-country projects in the field of energy. I voted for this report in order to support a vital aspect: improving cooperation with third countries on energy and infrastructures. This multilateral cooperation will help to consolidate the partnerships with third countries in several areas; innovation and research into building reliable networks and facilities will ensure that the European Union has a diversified supply.

 Bluefin tuna stocks in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean have fallen dramatically over the years, and urgent action is needed to protect them. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), to which the EU is a contracting party under the common commercial policy, adopted a new recommendation at its annual meeting in 2010. The amendments include reducing the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and strengthening control measures used to implement a recovery plan. I am therefore in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 302/2009 concerning a multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. The financial returns on fishing are so high that they actively encourage illegal fishing and other illegal activities. The time has come, therefore, to reassess the management measures adopted by ICCAT and to adapt them to current activities. It is also high time that the European Union acted quickly on its own initiative and as a precautionary measure to protect bluefin tuna and to rebuild stocks. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The European Commission has put the proposal for a financial transaction tax (FTT) at the centre of the debate, particularly in response to the serious consequences of the financial crisis. Ms Podimata’s report proposes to make the financial sector bear a share of the costs of the crisis, to dissuade financial establishments from taking excessive risks, to supplement regulatory measures aimed at preventing future crises and, finally, to generate additional revenue to finance the EU’s general budgets through the enrichment of the residence principle and the removal of pension funds or institutions for occupational retirement provision from the list of financial institutions to which the FTT would be applicable. The report puts forward strong arguments in favour of the application of the FTT at EU level. I am therefore in favour of this proposal. However, the report does not address the management of the revenue from the FTT and opts to have it managed by the multiannual financial framework programme. The FTT would make a significant contribution to the EU’s own resources, thereby broadening the framework for financing specific policies, projects and public goods. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 It was in 1985 that the European Union and China signed the first bilateral cooperation agreement. However, after almost 30 years of partnership, there is still a significant imbalance in trade relations between the EU and China. The list of these disharmonies shows worrying signs: access to Chinese public procurement is limited for foreign enterprises, protection of intellectual property is weak, there are systematic restrictions on the exportation of Chinese rare earths to European industries and, finally, the undervaluation and non-convertibility of the yuan pose a serious problem. Reciprocity, the cornerstone of the agreement, seems no longer, or insufficiently, present in trade relations. European enterprises are currently unable to invest in China under conditions similar to those governing Chinese investors in Europe. My vote in favour of the report by Ms de Sarnez lends support to the proposals made to rebalance EU-Chinese relations. It is also important to provide compliant protection tools and measures to update the terms of this agreement between the EU and China. Finally, we need to address the lack of transparency and reciprocal competition, which sours Sino-European relations today. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The Arab Spring represents an unprecedented revolution in the Mediterranean world. These revolutions have redefined the relationships between the Southern Mediterranean and the European Union, and have built a new trading partnership, founded on fundamental values such as human rights and democracy. This partnership must therefore be consolidated through the establishment of a free trade area, regional integration and a trade strategy. We have a unique opportunity to cooperate in the fields of employment and growth, to step up regional integration and the presence of the European Union through its trade, investment and financing activities. The report reaffirms trade as a solid pillar in the European Neighbourhood Policy, and as a means of involving SMEs by making them an additional tool for economic democratisation. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 There is no doubt that this draft resolution on maritime piracy strengthens the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP). Indeed, maritime transport has been a key vehicle for European economic growth, and not just growth in Europe, as more than three quarters of world trade is carried by sea. The European Union therefore has a genuine interest in ensuring that security is a factor in the common maritime policy. Over recent years, we have seen in the news a resurgence of criminal acts at sea. We find the greatest number of acts of maritime piracy in targeted areas, often concentrated in the Red Sea, and through which large numbers of European and international transport and trading vessels pass. Most of these acts remain unpunished. That is why this motion for a resolution is essential because it calls again for immediate and effective measures against impunity of this nature and calls for the need for strategic coordination between the European Union and third countries.

 Water is a resource for humankind and access to water is fundamental. Due to climate change, there are fears of a decline in the quantity and quality of water available, particularly drinking water, as well as a rise in the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. It is therefore necessary to rationalise water use and the European Parliament’s motion for a resolution calls for more efficient water usage especially in the sectors where most water is used, such as the agriculture sector. Also, the resolution underlines the need to make concrete commitments towards the promotion and protection of water resources, especially in light of the upcoming Rio+20 conference. That is why I voted for this resolution during the very week when the World Water Forum was taking place in Marseille. Jean Roatta  (PPE

The report underlines the importance of taking concrete steps to achieve gender parity in elected offices in the national parliaments and in the European Parliament. We should aim to achieve parity in electoral lists. The report also proposes measures designed to ensure parity within the European Commission, the EEAS and other political and administrative bodies. It is because I am conscious of the importance of parity for the exercise of democracy in Europe, and the current imbalance in that regard, that I voted in favour of this report, in the hope that progress will at last be made.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the signature of the agreement between the European Union and Morocco concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures on agricultural products and fishery products has an economic dimension and, above all, a political dimension. The agreement with Morocco represents support for the rural development policy, support for local farmers as well as support for the democratic process that was initiated several months ago after the parliamentary election. This agricultural agreement is therefore a major component of the advanced status granted to the Kingdom of Morocco in 2008. It also shows that the EU supports and encourages the programme of constitutional and democratic reforms in Morocco. Over and above the economic dimension, this agreement will formally enshrine the rapprochement between the European Union and Morocco. The credibility of the European Union is at stake. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot maintain bilateral relations that merely limp along. That is why I would encourage you to vote in favour of the signature of this agreement. It is a balanced, coherent agreement, which we need so that we can open as soon as possible the negotiations on a free trade agreement. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The European Union is the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid. In 2010, the European Union’s contribution totalled EUR 2.957 billion, and 36% of that aid came from the Commission. The Commission manages its humanitarian activities from its headquarters in Brussels and with the help of a network of local offices all around the world. The average annual budget managed by DG ECHO for its humanitarian aid activities between 2006 and 2010 was EUR 889 million. The report focuses on the following key issues: efficiency and effectiveness of the ECHO control, monitoring and supervision system, especially when framework partnership agreement (FPA) partners or international organisation partners (such as the United Nations) are involved. The report also underlines the need to ensure the sustainability, coherence and complementarity of humanitarian actions, which are key objectives of the EU’s development policy. I therefore voted in favour of this report. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The Committee on Development, on which I sit, worked with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, which was responsible for this report on women’s situation in war. This report deals with the responsibility of women in peace negotiations as well as the impact of armed conflict across the globe on women. The report recommends the creation of a post of Special EU Representative on Women within the European External Action Service (EEAS) and calls on the Member States to put in place action plans to improve the situation of women in conflict countries. As I agree fully with the actions to be taken to improve the situation of women, I voted in favour of this report. Jean Roatta  (PPE

 The objective of ‘universal access to energy by 2030’ was launched in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In developing countries, households generally spend a high percentage of their budget on the purchase of low-quality fuels for heating and cooking compared with households with access to electricity and to liquid and gas fuels. In developing countries, sustainable energy access for the poor faces a number of barriers, notably: the inability of the poor to pay for the services, investment costs, connection costs and no national capacity to produce the energy generation equipment and spare parts required. The report stresses that, whilst none of the MDGs are specifically related to energy, access to modern, sustainable energy services for all is a prerequisite for achieving the MDGs. We now need to bring energy to the fore in the debate on the eradication of poverty, by establishing a specific programme focusing on ‘energy and development’ within the framework of the European Union’s development cooperation policy. It is for these priorities that I voted in favour of this report. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

 As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development on Mr Gallagher’s report, I thought it was important to point out that when the European Commission wants to impose sanctions on a country for unsustainable fishing practices, it should take into account that country’s level of development. This is because, according to the principle of policy coherence with development goals, it is crucial, in my opinion, that the measures adopted for fisheries do not undermine the development plans and strategies implemented by the European Union in these countries. Mr Gallagher’s draft report takes up this important idea for our Committee on Development specifying that the measures should not be unjustified, or even discriminatory. I therefore call on the European Commission, when it adopts such measures, to respect this principle of policy coherence with development objectives and to duly consider the level of development and the vulnerability of countries. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

 In an effort to promote and to allow access to energy in developing countries insofar as this access contributes to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), I feel that it is important for the European Parliament to respond to the United Nations General Assembly’s declaration of 2012 as the ‘International Year of Sustainable Energy for All’. However, Norbert Neuser’s politically biased report refuses developing countries the right to be free to choose their energy policy by calling on ‘the Commission and the Member States neither to fund nor to otherwise encourage the use of nuclear power in developing countries’. I therefore voted against this paragraph which imposes choices on developing countries by limiting the energy sources to which they can have access. Nuclear power is a clean energy source that could give millions of citizens in developing countries access to basic services such as mains electricity. Maurice Ponga,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, we will give our verdict for the third time on the new development cooperation instrument (DCI) providing for Banana Accompanying Measures (BAM) for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) banana-producing countries following the reduction in tariff preferences. This aid programme has a budget of EUR 190 million and is intended to support 10 ACP countries until 2013. It is crucially important for our African and Caribbean partners, since the banana sector is of considerable economic and social importance in these countries. I bitterly regret the fact that not all of Parliament’s demands concerning the use of delegated acts have been accepted for this instrument. We have nevertheless managed to make progress. Indeed, the text outlines clear objectives and specific criteria for the allocation of resources to the Commission. The Commission has also made a statement specifying how these criteria will be applied. Moreover, we have a statement from the Council regarding the next Multiannual Financial Framework, specifying that the latter will take due account of delegated acts in external aid instruments post-2013. Finally, Parliament states in its resolution – and this is a crucial point in my view – that the outcome of this conciliation does not set any kind of precedent. I have just come back from Togo, where the 22nd session of the ACP-European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly was being held, and I believe I can say that our ACP partners are counting on us, given the urgency of the situation. The funds ought to have been released two years ago. We must be aware of the terrible consequences for our ACP partners should the DCI/BAM Regulation be rejected. The situation of some farmers is catastrophic. We cannot wait any longer and must act accordingly. I am therefore counting on you to endorse this text. Maurice Ponga,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development.

 Mr President, I wanted to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Ms Lövin, on her excellent work. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development, I am pleased that the Committee on Fisheries has taken up the points contained in our opinion, because it is vital for the development dimension to be taken into account in the measures to combat illegal fishing at the global level, for the sake of policy coherence and the close links with development policy. Indeed, combating illegal fishing requires global solutions and the involvement of all countries, including developing ones. However, countries’ technical and financial capabilities also need to be taken into account in the actions to be undertaken. The same constraints cannot be imposed on developed and developing countries without support measures. Small island states have very limited capabilities, for example. Therefore, they must be supported in their efforts to combat illegal fishing. That is why the Union will have to increase the budget for the fisheries sector when it signs agreements in this area in developing countries. Furthermore, it is vital to ensure that the measures to combat illegal fishing are actually applied, because this practice harms the development of countries insofar as it reduces the financial resources they could earn from fishing as an economic activity. The fact is, developing countries need those resources to implement social, economic and education policies. Lastly, it is important for the European Union, when implementing these measures to combat illegal fishing in developing countries, to encourage the involvement of civil society and businesses alongside the countries receiving aid. A holistic approach needs to be taken to halt the scourge of illegal fishing. Maurice Ponga  (PPE
).

 Madam President, I wanted to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Kaczmarek, on his excellent work. It is important that every year, the European Parliament take stock of the work of the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), insofar as this assembly plays a determining role in enhancing the North-South dialogue and in implementing a development policy that is founded on partnership and exchange. 2010 was an eventful year for the JPA, which met twice – as previous speakers have said – in Spain and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to discuss, among other things, the impact of climate change in ACP countries, the impact of the global crisis, freedom and independence of the media, and food security. In 2010, the JPA also sent the first election observation mission of this parliamentary term. I had the honour of co-chairing this mission in Burundi for the presidential elections with Mr Assarid, a Malian MP. This election observation mission was a real success. We were able to meet all the political players involved and thanks to the dual origin of this delegation, both ACP and European, we embodied a different legitimacy from European and African missions. I therefore call on the JPA Bureau to renew this experience, since it will make it possible to put into practice solidarity and the special relations that unite the European Union and ACP countries.

 I am glad that Parliament is stating its views on the current EU-Canada trade negotiations and outlining its priorities in this regard. Canada is undoubtedly a trade partner of the EU, but it is imperative that we in Parliament relay the concerns of our fellow citizens located both on European territory and in regions forming part of the European family, namely, the protection and defence of their interests. By ‘European family’, I mean the overseas countries and territories (OCT), which, although not strictly European territories, maintain a special relationship with the European Union, and, in particular, with the Member States of which they are part. In the trade negotiations currently under way, it is the archipelago of St Pierre and Miquelon, next door to Canada, that is particularly affected. I therefore call on the Commission, during the negotiations, to defend and protect the interests of that overseas country and territory situated in the North Atlantic Ocean. Maurice Ponga,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will today give its verdict for a second time on the amendment to the financing instrument for development cooperation providing for the establishment of Banana Accompanying Measures for the main ACP banana-producing countries. These accompanying measures are justified by the reduction in tariff preferences granted to the ACP countries following the conclusion, in December 2009, of the Geneva Agreement with the United States and the countries of Latin America. The European Union made a commitment at that time to provide EUR 190 million in support to the ACP countries to help them cope with this new competition. We amended both the form and the content of the Commission proposal at first reading. The Council disagreed with us on the form, which is why the regulation has been submitted for a second reading today. Indeed, the Council refused to allow the delegated acts procedure to be applied to strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes, and hence refused to implement the advances of the Treaty of Lisbon. Parliament decided to react quickly, and that is crucial. We are therefore sending a strong political message to the ACP countries. The European Parliament is behind them and is doing everything in its power to ensure that the EUR 190 million are released as quickly as possible. Yet we are also sending a message to the Council. The European Parliament is defending its prerogatives as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. The ball is now in the Council’s court. The European Union made a commitment to the ACP countries. The Council should therefore shoulder its responsibilities, as Parliament has done. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question (Rule 149(8)) Maurice Ponga  (PPE

All I would say is that there are international agreements in place that require the European Union to invest in its relations with the ACP countries, and this is one of the agreements that the European Union must prioritise.

 I welcome the European Parliament’s decision to approve the interim agreement between the European Union and the Pacific States. This agreement reflects the commitment of the European Union to this region of the world and sends a strong political signal to the States in the region. I am pleased about that. The political resolution that accompanies this decision to approve the agreement provides an opportunity to point out our demands. We want to establish a balanced and fair relationship with the Pacific States; one which allows for the development of these island States while protecting the interests of our own citizens. While the interim agreement includes specific provisions on the rules of origin for fishery products, it was important to manage this derogation. Indeed, in order to ensure that this derogation, which should allow for the creation of jobs and wealth, is of genuine benefit to local populations and does not harm the European fishery product processing and canning industries, it was vital to provide for an assessment of its impact as soon as possible and to allow for its suspension, where necessary. Guarantees exist to ensure that the agreement is fair and that measures will be taken, if necessary, to protect our interests. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many years, the European Union has maintained a special and strong relationship with ACP countries. This special relationship has resulted, in particular, in the granting of tariff preferences. Such is the case for the banana sector, in which ACP countries have benefited from a preferential trading arrangement for their exports to the European Union. This preference has been challenged at the WTO, especially by the Latin American countries, which are large exporters of bananas. Therefore, in order to comply with WTO rules and to end a long dispute, the European Union accepted to reduce its tariffs in the banana sector in December 2009. On account of the privileged partnership that it maintains with ACP countries, the European Union nonetheless wanted to help banana-producing ACP countries to cope with this increased competition. Consequently, Europe has pledged EUR 190 million until 2013 to help banana-producing ACP countries to adapt, be competitive and restructure their sector if need be. In the report on which we will vote tomorrow, the European Parliament is reaffirming its commitment to, and support for, banana-producing ACP countries, and I very much welcome that. Thus, we have suggested, among other things, that the European Union could adopt complementary measures after 2013 if necessary. Maurice Ponga  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleague Mrs Morin-Chartier and the other Members have said, on 27 and 28 February the violent storm Xynthia battered several French regions, claiming 53 lives and causing huge material damage. The storm was exceptionally intense; it caused devastating floods along the French coast. After Madeira, Europe has once again been affected. Brittany, the region of my colleague and friend, Mr Cadec, has been severely affected. A state of natural disaster has thus been declared in three French regions: Brittany, Poitou-Charentes and Pays de la Loire. In the face of these disasters, the European Union must demonstrate its responsiveness and express its solidarity. Words and a resolution alone will not enable us to support the victims of these disasters; we must also and above all provide financial aid. I therefore call on the European Commission – and my colleague Mr Béchu supports my request – to swiftly release the EU Solidarity Fund so as to help the disaster areas cope with the damage. This disaster shows that Mr Barnier’s proposal to create a European civil protection force is relevant. Europeans must take action together, since more and more disasters are occurring and they are affecting our European territories and, in particular, our most isolated and vulnerable regions, such as the islands in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean islands.

 I welcome the adoption, today, by a large majority (558 votes to 57), of the report by Mr van Nistelrooij. By adopting this report, Parliament is sending out a strong message to citizens and is responding to the social concerns relayed in particular by Eurocities. The report provides for the possibility of using the ERDF for the renovation and replacement of existing buildings and for new structures designed to help marginalised communities in rural or urban environments in each of the 27 Member States. This extension from the 12 States that joined in 2000 and 2007 to all the Member States offers solutions to the problems that insalubrious housing poses for certain marginalised communities throughout the EU. It will thus be possible to establish an integrated and sustainable approach at EU level. Furthermore, this extension dovetails perfectly with the aim of the 2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. I am pleased that Parliament has voted for these amendments and I hope that the regions concerned will find it a useful tool for solving what is an urgent and fundamental problem for these communities.

Mr President, thanks to the tenacity of the Swedish Presidency, which I too thank, we have the Treaty of Lisbon. However, a treaty such as this is not a project, but a tool, a toolbox to serve the European project, and it is therefore up to the men and women who manage the institutions – the Commission, its president, the Council – and to us here to make good use of these tools in the future, at the end of a transition period that has been long, too long. For we are now better equipped to take up three major challenges in the face of which, ladies and gentlemen, we will together be playing not only for the credibility of the European Union, but also, to repeat the word used by Mr Havel just now, for its sovereignty. The first challenge is that of the crisis, and we must not – we cannot – come out of it as we went into it, as if nothing had happened. There are lessons to be learnt in our dialogue with the United States, in particular, regarding governance, regarding solidarity, regarding transparency and regulation of the global economy, and for we Europeans there are lessons to be learnt as regards the safeguarding – I use that word deliberately – the consolidation of the internal market, in the ‘reconciliation of the market and society’, to repeat a word that I have adopted as my own, used by Mario Monti, to whom President Barroso has moreover usefully entrusted a task on this issue. The second challenge is that of green growth. In Kyoto, we took the lead on this issue, thanks to the European Commission. We must maintain this position by ensuring, of course, that our partners, the other large countries, the large regions, adopt a reciprocal attitude. And then, the third challenge is for us to be at the table, not ‘behind the table’, but ‘at the table’, of those who are going to decide on the world order – or disorder – over the next 20 years. This is not easy when we number 27 nations, but it is crucial all the same, unless we do not mind – which I personally do – being subcontractors or being under the influence of the other countries. This is why we have a great deal of confidence in the future work of the High Representative, whose job it will be to create a real common diplomatic and strategic culture. Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the sooner we are ready, the better it will be for European citizens. That is why we eagerly and confidently await the decisions that you will take. Michel Barnier  (PPE

Madam President, Mr Barroso, there are several elements to, and reasons for, our show of confidence and our very clear vote tomorrow. The first element is that of democratic consistency: with regard to the choice of the 27 Heads of State or Government who chose you unanimously; with regard to what we said during the electoral campaign – it was not so long ago – and with regard to the citizens’ vote. We are not going to apologise for having won the elections, even though we are aware – we are well aware, I would say to our fellow Members – that we will have to surround you with more ideas than those of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) alone. Then, there is democratic consistency with regard to the exercise that you have been conducting for several weeks, in the demanding, sincere and humble dialogue with Parliament, and we are here to bear witness to it. There is a second reason, which is a conviction: the very strong conviction that there will be no strong policies in Europe if the institutions are weak. We need strong institutions. This is why we hope that the Treaty of Lisbon will be ratified. It is a tool box that will make the institutions work. We need a strong Commission that can confront the crisis as quickly as possible. The third reason is a contract of confidence that we have signed with you. In the face of this, the most serious and most profound economic, financial, food – let us not forget the one billion starving people in the world – and environmental crisis, we need the Commission to show its fighting spirit. We need you, and us with you, to learn all the lessons from this crisis, in terms of governance, regulation, innovation and new policies – I am thinking of the idea of a European savings bank to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the strategic sectors – and, with regard to the most profound crisis, the environmental crisis, to introduce a new model of economic and social growth, of green growth, as you yourself said. That, Mr Barroso, is why we shall be ready, tomorrow, to sign the contract of confidence with you. Michel Barnier  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should, of course, like to thank Commissioner Dimas for his presence and his answers and for the attention that he continues to pay to all these disasters. We did a great deal of work together when President Barroso asked me to draft a report, which he also mentioned, on the creation of a European civil protection force. I presented this report on 9 May 2006. When I re-read it, and I see all the disasters that have happened, I realise that it is still topical. Mrs Tzavela, obviously, it is not just Greece. Every country is affected, and I would add that there are not only natural disasters, there are also human disasters, caused by mankind. I am thinking of maritime disasters – Erika
 and countless others – and of Chernobyl-type industrial accidents. There are natural disasters other than fires. I am thinking of the tsunami. One day we can expect a tsunami in the Mediterranean such as the one at the start of the 20th century that totally destroyed the city of Messina. Frankly, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tools we are using are not up to these disasters, which are going to increase under the twin effect of global warming and transport. Hence the reason why I think we should be more ambitious. I am grateful to the Commission, to Commissioner Dimas and to all his teams from the Directorate-General that are putting the civil protection mechanism into operation. I believe that we must go further. It is conceivable to have enhanced cooperation with those Member States that want it. If there are not 27 of us to make up this civil protection force, let us start with 12 or 15 of us. Then you will see that this affects everyone. When I compile the list of disasters, I can say that everyone is affected: the floods that hit Germany in 2002, the major pandemics and also terrorism. That, Commissioner, is why I would like the Commission to take the initiative to go further, to propose that the Member States go further. Our Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, will support you in these proactive initiatives.

 Controlling production volumes is an essential tool which must be made available to all bodies involved in defending and managing protected designations of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indications (PGI), following the example of the cheese sector with the adoption of the Milk Package in March 2012. This will enable them to maintain a high level of quality and added value in their products and avoid market imbalances. Unfortunately, the Council and the Commission were unable to reach an agreement on this provision, which was supported by a majority in Parliament. However, other points in the quality package represent real progress, for example, in terms of protecting against misuse and shortening procedures. The Council, which is divided on this issue, has nevertheless agreed to confirm in a statement that this debate is not closed, but that it will now be included in the discussions on the reform of the single common market organisation (CMO). That is why I do not wish to call into question the agreement reached with the Council, as this would block the adoption of the text and put the debate on volumes management on hold. I will therefore vote against the amendment authorising this mechanism, which I otherwise fully support. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 Mr President, the 2006 reform was supposed to improve the competitiveness of the sugar beet sector in Europe. This reform was carried out at great sacrifice in terms of men and land. Factories were closed. Whole areas of land had to abandon beet production. Cane sugar refiners are now calling for the suspension of tariffs on sugar without any trade negotiation. Increased imports of cane sugar from other third countries would undermine the preferences granted to our traditional partners in developing countries and could halt investments in these countries. The European Union sugar market is totally open. As far as I am concerned, any delay in investments in African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the least developed countries (LDCs) cannot justify the refiners’ demand to disregard them. As a rapporteur for this House on the common market organisation (CMO) in the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), the ACP countries that I have encountered have explicitly asked me to keep the system in place today. Ladies and gentlemen, this House has already, on a number of occasions, had discussions, regarding, in particular, the Dess report in July 2011 and Resolution No 2010/2110, passed in March 2011. Yes, we must defend jobs. However, under the pretext of defending dozens of industrial jobs, do we need to have more people abandoning our lands with the removal of European producers? For three years now, is it not the case that our Parliament has, all too often, affirmed and reaffirmed its determination to defend our food self-sufficiency and to promote our agriculture as much as possible?

 After an amazing campaign of misinformation, Parliament has rejected the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). Just one article concerned Internet users. The prime purpose of the text was to protect us against counterfeiting, in particular intellectual property. By rejecting it, we have paved the way for the relocation of jobs outside Europe and for an upsurge in the black economy, child labour and other forms of exploitation. Congratulations to those responsible for this failure. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 The final text put to the vote in Parliament does not take into consideration some scientific knowledge and portrays a caricature with regard to agricultural issues, showing a lack of understanding of the reality of agriculture, that is, the reality of 13.5 million European farmers.

 We should welcome the adoption of this text as some excellent work has been done. Whilst not entirely perfect, the policy changes are significant in comparison with decisions made in recent years, notably, the measure that gives producers the right to group together so that they gain greater clout in bargaining with processors and distributors. From now on, interprofessional agreements will be an integral part of the European vocabulary, and the right of producers of protected designation of origin (PDO) / protected geographic indication (PGI) cheeses to manage their production volumes has finally been recognised. Other improvements such as, the requirement of contracts in the supply chain, or a mechanism ensuring that disadvantaged regions are not ‘drained’ of their milk production upon the expiry of dairy quotas, must be achieved in the years to come. The ‘soft landing’ promised by the Commissioner at the time of drafting, Ms Fischer Boel, should well and truly become a reality for European producers. From now on, producers must fully embrace the new tools established by European legislation in order to help further their interests and to take part in the running of their market. Michel Dantin,

 Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, we have reached the end of our work. Commissioner, we agree with some of the points you just made. There is one word, however, that I wish to highlight: the word ‘quickly’. I do not think that we can agree on that. It was in February three years ago that the milk crisis erupted or reached its peak. That is how long it has taken us to reach a compromise allowing us to offer milk producers new prospects. I welcome the spirit in which we worked and congratulate our rapporteur, who, for this first, because it was a first for us to legislate together, enabled us to work in a spirit of genuine dialogue and with a shared desire to build something. We are therefore offering producers a new capacity, that of derogating from competition law and organising themselves into stronger units. However, Commissioner, we all know only too well that this is just one stage, just one step, and that we have not yet found the real solution and the real tools to move beyond the era of milk quotas. An exit phase should be prepared. That phase has not yet been designed. We have to continue to work on that aspect. As you said, we have not yet completely resolved the issue of vulnerable regions either. Even if we are offering them a tool, with the possibility of organising themselves better with the geographical protection mechanisms, we are still not enabling them to keep milk in those regions. It is absolutely essential for the report that you are going to submit to us in 2014 to set out solutions that allow us to maintain this activity in vulnerable regions, where grass is often the only production and where milk is often the only way of making a living. Without it, all of the work and all of the hopes that we have put in this text will be in vain for many farmers. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, Commissioner, you fulfil your duties well. You defend a text with conviction. This is not your text, however. It is an inherited text. We know very well that, if you had had to negotiate this text yourself, it would have been different because you are currently involved in the CAP negotiations and you are aware that it is difficult to impose environmental constraints on European farmers when texts such as this proposal ignore that issue completely. You are aware that it is difficult to establish a common framework for the CAP because the standard of living differs from one EU country to another. Here, we are not taking into account the standard of living of Moroccan producers, whom, we are supposed to believe, represent El Dorado. Yes, the situation is complicated as I am sure that nobody here in this House wants to jeopardise Morocco’s development. Morocco is a country that we need for stability in North Africa. Morocco is a gateway for developing new trade and we know that every time we develop new trade, both parties benefit to some extent. However, I will get back to what I was saying about the environment. How are we going to explain to European farmers that we are perhaps going to force them to comply with the Water Framework Directive under the system of cross-compliance but that at the same time we are not going to pay any attention to the production conditions of the tomatoes that are allowed to enter? How are we going to explain to them that the water table is falling by two metres per year in some regions but that that is being ignored? I firmly believe that the model that we are proposing to the Moroccans is not a sustainable model. Perhaps our producers do not have to worry because, with the system they are being offered, Moroccan producers will die before them. This is serious, however. In my opinion, we have to defend Morocco, we have to defend democracy in Morocco but we also have to take care to ensure that what we are proposing is balanced from an environmental, social and economic perspective. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is now three years since the debate on the aid programme for the most deprived got desperately bogged down in Council. This untenable deadlock is not acceptable. It is all the more unacceptable given that the death sentence has been pronounced on the programme at a time when our continent is going through an economic and social crisis of unprecedented violence, which is throwing so many of our fellow citizens into turmoil. Some symbols construct Europe; others weaken it dangerously. Let us ensure that we do not destroy today what was patiently constructed yesterday, especially at a time when the difficulties we face seem to be straining the bonds that unite our States. Those same difficulties are pushing people towards nationalist sentiments and to turn their backs on Europe. Re-establishing the every man for himself principle as a normal and acceptable reflex is far removed from my idea of Europe and from that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), to which I belong. Our people deserve better. They deserve the Europe we have been building together for more than 50 years – a Europe that is more than a simple economic agreement. Quite the opposite, Europe embodies values that, more than ever, we need to embrace – values that place human beings at the top of the political agenda. Today, it is imperative that we move away from sterile legal debate in order to take fair and responsible political decisions. Allocating resources to the European Social Fund within a fund created specifically for that purpose under the revised common agricultural policy is not what the debate is about. It is no longer what the debate is about. The ruling of the Court of Justice has now created an emergency which will soon affect 18 million people receiving food aid. The real question now relates to our common vision of Europe and its future. I am convinced that its destiny does not, under any circumstances, lie in the full or partial renationalisation of food aid, however symbolically. Let there be no mistake: only if we act together will we succeed in tackling the huge challenges we face today. It is only by acting together, showing solidarity and standing united that, on our continent, we will retain the resources to guarantee the future prosperity of all our fellow citizens. Commissioner, you have courageously proposed measures. It is high time that ... (The President cut off the speaker) Michel Dantin,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Dess, the shadow rapporteurs and other contributors on the work that they have done to draft this text. In my opinion, it is both balanced and ambitious. We will be voting on the report tomorrow. Almost six months after Mr Lyon drafted his report setting out the European Parliament’s views on the common agricultural policy (CAP) post-2013, the European Commission decided to draw on the report by including many of its ideas in the communication issued on 18 November 2010. The new report, which was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, affirms the new direction that we would like the common agricultural policy to take in the coming years. Our farmers are not there to produce mere commodities, or wares to sell. They are there, above all, to produce food for Europe’s 500 million citizens, but also to help to feed the rest of the world. Stating it in these terms is not just semantics: it is a philosophical choice that we are making. Mr Dess’s report endorses a positive approach to agriculture’s environmental and ecological contribution and therefore appeals for a reduction of the often onerous administrative procedures generated by European and national legislation. By arguing in favour of graduated direct payments and a review of the regulatory instruments, the report also provides a new perspective on social perception of the CAP and of global trade. As we speak, the G20 in Paris is beginning discussions on regulating the global commodities markets, with particular reference to agricultural commodities. Parliament’s approach, then, has not been defined in a vacuum, where we are cut off from the world. Rather, it is part of the wider deliberations on how to come up with a global response to a global challenge. As with Mr Lyon’s report one year ago and Mr Garriga Polledo’s report on the financial perspectives last month, tomorrow we will be voting in favour of maintaining the agricultural budget for the 2014-2020 programming period. I am sure that it will be a close-run thing, but we do need to take a stand and to make choices, because we will not have the money to do everything ... (The President cut off the speaker) Michel Dantin  (PPE

 Mr President, I should like to thank the Spanish producers who submitted this timely petition to us. Indeed, for months now, we in Parliament have been warning the Commission of the danger to our internal market of a number of bilateral agreements. Clearly, we are sensitive to the issue of Morocco’s development. Clearly, we know that creating stability for the Moroccan people in their own country is the best possible solution, and that it will stop us from having to solve numerous immigration problems in the future. However, when the Commission tells us that a new agreement will simply ratify a situation, we can plainly see, through the reports by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), that the situation to which the Commission refers is not the real solution. Furthermore, I should like to alert the Commission to another point. We are told that the negotiated – the renegotiated – agreements will enable us to support Moroccan producers. Which producers are we talking about, though? The exporters are primarily large agri-food companies that have set up huge farms in Morocco. Small Moroccan producers are not the ones who benefit from our agreements, as they do not have the capacity to produce in conditions acceptable to the European market. Let us not confuse the issue, but do not mislead the MEPs either: that is my request to the Commission. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR)
 Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for my group, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for the conditions in which we were able to work with him on this matter. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe this is a truly strategic matter at the moment. We have already heard about China. I should like to quote a figure: in 2010, the Chinese bought 49% of the soymeal placed on the market. The forecast for 2011 is that the same customers will buy 57% of the total quantities placed on the market. Hence, it really is a matter of European independence that we are looking at in the medium term. Imagine for a moment that some very intensive farming regions found themselves without imported soya for a week: what would happen? We urgently need to redevelop these crops in our region. My country introduced a policy in the context of Article 68 back in 2010. This policy demonstrated that production could be adapted to policies. (The President cut off the speaker) Michel Dantin  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I believe that we should be pleased, because we may be talking about a crisis today, but this is because our system has worked. We have the strongest consumer protection system in the world. Consumers need to bear that in mind right now. However, the system did not work properly, and before we come up with another one, I believe that we must carefully and comprehensively look at the reasons why the problem was discovered so late, and we must ask ourselves about the causes of this delay. However, I think that, apart from denouncing the criminal act itself, we must also question why it happened. I believe that, because of our actions, the agricultural and agri-food sectors are in a race towards low costs and towards the lowest prices on the supply side, and we are no longer shielded from deviations such as this type of unacceptable behaviour. So, Commissioner, do you intend to increase the penalties for such acts? My second question is about how we will provide immediate support – and I mean immediate – to the breeders concerned. This is because the margins are so weak that, if some people do not receive support very soon, or even advances on amounts owed to them, these breeders will disappear by the time the procedure reaches a conclusion at what I would call ‘normal’ speed. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Madam President, I think that the Member who asked a question actually had a comment to make on a situation rather than a question to put to me. Obviously, we know that the system has gone wrong. However, with regard to European consumers, I would like to emphasise how strict our protection system is. We cannot let the statement that nothing has been done go unchallenged, given that we have the highest standards in the world. Michel Dantin  (PPE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in the thanks and congratulations addressed to those who have managed to conclude these very difficult negotiations. We are getting ready to approve a budget tomorrow which is a big step forward for the Europe of mobility and the Europe of young people. Above all, this budget demonstrates Parliament’s determination not to abandon large-scale European investments during this crisis period. However, I would like to share with you my concern and my displeasure about the choice made today by some political groups and, in particular, the Socialists, whose representatives were in government jobs at key moments, to jeopardise ITER, the only fundamental long-term research project in the European Union in which we play a leading role. As you know, the European Union made a commitment last June to contribute an additional EUR 1.3 billion to this project, which is crucial for our security. It is therefore Europe’s credibility in the world that is going to be called into question by our vote. This attitude has meant that we have lost nearly EUR 600 million of unused money in 2010, which could have been allocated to ITER. This is ridiculous! Michel Dantin  (PPE

 Mr President, our fellow citizens have expectations of us, they have expectations of Europe on the issue of world governance. We must be a proactive force, we must be a decisive force. Several speakers this morning have made the point that the French Presidency of the G20 could represent an opportunity for Europe. I clearly share this view, and I believe that our Parliament ought to be regularly informed of the progress of the G20’s work by the Presidency itself. I understand that the President of the French Republic would be willing to come and address us. Mr President, I think that you should invite him to do so. Michel Dantin,

Madam President, Commissioner, you have a good command of the French language and you know my country well. In France, there is an expression that describes something one dreams of but which never materialises, we talk about the Arlésienne
. For farmers, simplification is undoubtedly one of the forms, one of the faces of the Arlésienne
. As you have said, the Commission has already taken action to try and simplify procedures and I would like to go into a bit more detail. To my mind, there are two aspects to this issue. Firstly, there is everything to do with the requests for aid. I think it should be recognised that there has been an effort to simplify the paperwork during these last few years and months, and we give you credit for that. Secondly, there are the restrictions relating to all the conditions, the never-ending reporting requested from farmers for everything they do: taking a trailer full of manure to a field, using a dose of fertiliser in another field, using a dose of plant protection product in a third field, and if they make a mistake, they are sanctioned. Faced with this situation, Commissioner, I believe that we certainly need to find solutions. Last week, while presenting the proposal for the future common agricultural policy, you mentioned a few integrative measures that could be implemented and that could, in fact, lead, through the outcome produced by these measures, to measures that can be controlled by opinion, by farmers as well as by the Commission, measures for which we can be sure of the scientific effect. I have in mind the example of crop rotation. These measures should enable us to simplify the obligations imposed on farmers. This represents a considerable amount of work for the future. Furthermore, today as you did last week, you mentioned what is incumbent on Member States and I think you are right. Every year, the Commission controllers visit Member States before visiting the farmers. They go there with a critical eye to find what is not right. Yet could we not change their mission slightly, Commissioner, and ask them to also list – this would be beneficial to the Member States – areas where the Member States are going too far in applying EU legislation? Going too far is to impose on farmers obligations which are pointless in relation to the regulations. By doing so, you would have improved Europe’s image among our fellow citizens.

Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has been said, for bees are indeed a symbolic species, guardians of our environment. Currently, there are many research programmes dedicated to bees, with sometimes contradictory findings. A few days ago, a scientist came to see me and explained that the numerous planes that we can see in the sky have an effect on the diffraction of sun rays, leading to exhaustion and therefore to the excessive mortality of bees, for instance. Contrary to what one of our fellow Members on the right of this Chamber just said, I believe that here we have an example of a sector where pooling our knowledge and coordinating research programmes can provide a solution to the problems faced by each of our countries. Yes, Europe can be useful. This example of bees is maybe representative of European integration. Michel Dantin  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what a funny old world the agricultural world is! A year ago, in this Chamber, we were all bemoaning the general production situation. Today, one production sector, the cereal sector, is doing better than the others – and I think we should, all the same, welcome that. However, its success is unfortunately having very serious repercussions for another sector, the livestock sector. The real issue today is the agricultural industry’s inability to pass on the costs it has to incur to consumers. Therefore, as has already been said this morning, we need to help organise producers so that they can make their presence felt in their dealings with their customers and, in particular, in their dealings with the large-scale distribution sector. However, the chain, the functioning of the markets is more pernicious. How can we explain the fact that, for years, decades, we said that South American countries were placing a strain on production and bringing prices down? How can we explain that, although prices are today increasing again in those countries, we cannot pass on that increase to our producers because, yes, there has been an increase in costs, but – and this must also be said – there has been no increase in producer prices? How can we fail to mention the cost differentials that exist between our countries? Admittedly, this is partly a question of national responsibilities. However, the dumping that goes on today between our various countries helps destabilise markets, and I believe that Europe should tackle this issue. Yes, solutions must be found. European cereal producers are aware, I think, of the situation faced by their main customers – farmers. They are prepared to enter into a contractual agreement. Are you prepared, Commissioner, to support that agreement? Michel Dantin  (PPE

The amendment I tabled along with Mr Dess and 77 other MEPs demands full compliance by agricultural imports with European health, social, and consumer, environmental and animal protection standards. It is, after all, extraordinary to demand that European farmers conform to the highest production standards in the world, while at the same time increasing the quantity of agricultural products that can enter Europe without meeting those same standards. Consumers must be able to benefit from a single level of protection, no matter what they buy, and farmers must be rewarded for their tremendous efforts, not subjected to de facto 
unfair competition on the part of third countries. That is my idea of a balanced food and agriculture policy, anyway. This resolution sends a clear message to the Commission and to third countries, which is why I support it. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 France is one of the countries of the Union with the highest birth rates. This is due to a set of measures contained in an all-embracing family policy. The resolution as it stands after the votes on the amendments does not bring about any real improvement. On the contrary, it will throw everything into question because the budgetary burden of the measures cannot be borne at this time. Those are the reasons that led me to withhold approval from the text, which is, incidentally, well meaning. Michel Dantin  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report entrusted to our fellow Member, Mr Bové, addresses what is, today, a crucial issue for society, from consumers to producers. The Commission’s figures speak volumes, Commissioner: 20 years ago, milk producers received 31% of the chain’s turnover, which back then equated to just over EUR 450 million. Today, they receive only 24% of the turnover, or just under EUR 550 million. Other examples exist with regard to fruit, meat and so on. Clarifying pricing is therefore today a prerequisite for reforming the common agricultural policy (CAP) because, if we do not clarify it, the CAP will, in future, seem like a bottomless pit in the eyes of the public and of farmers themselves. The CAP’s profits are today being siphoned off, but for the benefit of whom, of what? Ladies and gentlemen, it is our duty to understand what is going on. Contrary to what I am hearing from certain quarters, producers are no less well organised today than they were 20 or 30 years ago. However, the other stakeholders have grown, and the number of producers has decreased even more rapidly than that of farmers. The chain has become longer, too. This situation requires us to adapt competition law and to supplement the market crisis management tools, which no longer seem suited to the new architecture of the chains linking producers to consumers. Lastly, there is the specific issue of quality products, in particular, with regard to imported imitations. We need clarity. Commissioner, your services are examining the functioning of the French prices and margins observatory. There is room for improvement, but it already contains a wealth of information on consumer-level pricing and on the niches where margins are hidden. I should like to commend the work that has also been done by our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Köstinger. Attacks have been made here and there today. One of the merits of our Parliament is that we respect different points of view. This is also the case with regard to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Everyone remains free to vote as they wish. For my part, I shall not compromise my vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Michel Dantin,

Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Lyon, as well as the team of shadow rapporteurs, who I feel cooperated effectively with him on this report. As far as our group is concerned, this report conveys an ambition for European agriculture. It was written following the raw material crises of 2007 and 2008 and following the farming crisis of 2009, which taught us that liberalism is not the solution for agriculture. Our agriculture is firstly intended to provide – to guarantee – food security for 450 million Europeans, but we must also take our place on solvent markets. It is clear that the conditions that have prevailed since the middle of the 20th century have evolved, that techniques have evolved and must still evolve, that they must change, and that agricultural policy instruments must also evolve. Agriculture must be supported in this evolution. While the first pillar, financed solely from the EU budget, must support the level of societal demands that we attach to agriculture, the second, cofinanced pillar must continue to support the modernisation of agriculture and agri-foods so as to take the new contexts into account. This policy will also have to be fairer – yes, I did say fairer – between countries and between farmers themselves. It is clearly our wish to give hope back to the 14 million farmers and their families, in particular to ensure the replacement of the 4.5 million farmers who, today, are over 60 and who are going to leave the profession. The issue of generational change will be one of our concerns. Michel Dantin  (PPE

Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent work that has been done. The text has developed between the two readings, and seems to be going in the right direction. In the year since we began discussing this issue, I have noticed that the public – at least in my region – is baffled when they see how little coordination there is between rail companies today. How can we, in this House, legitimately call for more ambition with regard to the environment? Should we merely express our regret that Copenhagen was not a complete success, when we in Europe are incapable of actually shifting our freight transport to rail, either purely to rail or to multimodal transport? Some sectors of multimodal transport have developed, and it has taken time for road hauliers to adapt, but they have been able to appreciate the complementary nature of this system and demonstrate that it is effective. We cannot have a debate today if nothing comes of it afterwards; we have an obligation to act, and to act quickly. It is true that, beyond this text, there may be some problems here and there with infrastructure. I would particularly like to draw your attention, Commissioner, to the issue of cross-border sections. They are often nobody’s responsibility, yet they are the link we need to successfully complete our European project. I have also heard some parties, and more specifically the social partners, express the fear that some powers may be lost. However, I am convinced that the success of this project will provide an opportunity for us to work harder, and to work harder together. I feel this is very much an issue on which Europe can show its practical side to our fellow citizens. We certainly need this. Michel Dantin  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, as you well know, agriculture is an economic sector that comprises specific features that mean that public intervention may occasionally be necessary, if not desirable, in the interests of producers, consumers and the public. There are at least three reasons why public intervention in this economic sector is as justifiable in the European Union as it is in other countries of the world. The characteristics of supply of agricultural goods and the demand for foodstuffs make agricultural markets unstable. Agriculture also produces non-market goods and helps ensure a certain degree of social stability in our countries and our countryside through the jobs that it creates. Above all, agriculture is the basis of an abundant, varied and healthy food supply. Can we be satisfied, then, with the current economic situation of our rural areas and our farmers? A few days ago, Commissioner, a senior official gave me the following figures for his département
 – as it happens, this is a French département
 that you know well, a livestock farming department. The administrative centre holds 2 500 agricultural accounts. Of those, 800 have a debt ratio in excess of 80%, and 20% have a debt ratio of 100% or more. Faced with such figures – which, I admit, surprised even me – the issue to be dealt with today is not just one of revenue but of the decapitalisation of European agriculture. Less aid, less public intervention and more restrictions on production: that is a truly explosive combination. It is true that the general economic crisis is aggravating the situation. However, we must also question certain decisions taken by the Commission, certain decisions taken by your colleagues, Commissioner. Agriculture remains a bargaining chip in trade agreements. Despite the situation in Europe, meat, certain cereals, fruits and vegetables are all affected. The recent agreement between the European Union and the Andean countries, in particular, Peru and Colombia, will sacrifice the producers of the outermost regions. We cannot continue with such a policy. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Mr President, Mrs Paulsen, thank you for your report. I would like to applaud the work that has been done by the various shadow rapporteurs as part of the preparation for this dossier and, in particular, the rapporteur for my group, Mrs Jeggle. This issue resonates differently in the various European countries. Not all producers or consumers perceive the issue in the same way. In spite of this, European legislation is gradually succeeding in creating a very strict standard, which I feel we should make much better use of in international negotiations and, in particular, in the control of imported products. However, as has already been said, these rules carry a cost, and every day we are seeing this cost rise for farmers and other operators, at the very time when the profitability of farming is being hit hard. This is, therefore, a clear justification for the common agricultural policy. If we spend EUR 100 per head per year to finance a common agricultural policy, animal welfare is one good reason why this funding is needed. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Mr President, I would like to thank our colleague, Mr Dorfmann, for his excellent work on this report. I think it sums up perfectly the issue as it stands today in terms of the Commission’s proposals. It is the Commissioner whom I would like to address in particular. This work has been going on for several months now. It is creating great agitation within several of our countries’ industries, which are threatened with reclassification, and this reclassification is happening or may happen at a time when – and this will be the subject of tomorrow evening’s oral question – many production sectors are experiencing particular difficulties. We therefore need to move forward and move forward quickly. I do not think we can wait three years to come up with a clear answer for the farmers who are affected by this delimitation exercise. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Scottà, I find it truly symbolic, Commissioner, that your first speech before this House should be on the very subject of quality policy. I believe that we take the same approach to these quality products. Yes, they represent an opportunity for our most fragile regions. Yes, they are a means by which to make the operators of a region and, in particular, farmers, more dynamic. Yes, they represent a strong signal sent out to European consumers, but also to consumers throughout the world, with regard to our agricultural model. Burgundy wine, Parma ham, certain Spanish meats – they have meaning far beyond the borders of each of our countries, far beyond the borders of Europe. The resolution that we shall no doubt adopt tomorrow offers you, Commissioner, a greater degree of ambition with regard to this policy of quality products, of products identified by different signs. European policy must be clearer; it must stop producers from being taken over by certain large industrial or distribution groups, which would clearly like to deprive producers of the benefit of the added value that these products give them. During the hearing, I drew your attention to the need to give organisations that bear, in particular, designations of origin overall responsibility for managing their products. Management of production rights is a fundamental part of quality production policy. Moreover, almost all of our committee voted in favour of an amendment along these lines. I should like to respond to our UK fellow Members with regard to paragraph 19 on the fruit and vegetables sector. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we must not go backwards, but neither must we allow the huge vacuum in fruit and vegetable policy that means that, today, distributors are the only ones calling the shots. Let us together interpret this amendment as a call to find a new middle way. Commissioner, you can very quickly convince us of your enthusiasm for this specific policy, which gives consumers a different image of agriculture. Now present us with a good text. Do so quickly; we have faith in you. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, thank you, once again, for your attention. The price crisis in 2007-2008 highlighted the weak position of consumers with regard to price volatility. The agricultural crisis of 2009 is having a much more detrimental effect on farms than the indices reveal. Why? Because the upward trend in agricultural prices was portrayed by many as sustainable, and because farmers without doubt invested far too much in 2008 and at the beginning of 2009 – far too much because a delay has built up since the beginning of the 2000s. On several occasions, Commissioner, you have expressed a desire to no longer intervene in market regulation in the same way. But have we failed to remember over the last 20 years that agricultural commodities are primarily food products and that we need a certain degree of price stability at both ends of the chain? Price stability is required at consumer level, on the one hand, because, due to other financial commitments such as mortgages, parenting and leisure activities, the consumer does not have enough leftover income to cope with price fluctuations. At producer level, on the other hand, price stability is required because business activity involves significant capital, which requires heavy investment. Organisation within the sectors that includes all the elements of the supply chain, as well as the new players – I am referring to the mass catering sector and processing companies for quick-frozen or even fresh-prepared products – can undoubtedly lead to the introduction of private tools for stabilising prices. Do you think it is possible to find a way forward with this, Commissioner, and is the Commission ready to participate in such discussions? Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your statement, which I believe reflects the remarkable work you have done during your mandate. Europe has chosen a food model to protect its population. Our fellow citizens are ready to pay EUR 100 per year per capita if we guarantee the quality of their food. The other day in committee, we learnt of the Food and Veterinary Office’s report. I must tell you that, as a new MEP, I was deeply concerned to see the discomfort of your staff, who obviously could not answer or did not want to answer our questions. Commissioner, should we be ashamed of having strict rules to protect our consumers? Should we be ashamed of imposing these rules on those who want to feed our consumers? Are we ashamed when, in order to sell aircraft or cars, these same countries force us to establish this or that factory or impose this or that condition on us? Our market access conditions are important conditions because they affect food and they affect the health of our residents. We have nothing to be ashamed of. Michel Dantin  (PPE
).

Madam President, Commissioner – I would have liked to have been able to address the Presidency of the Council too – ladies and gentlemen, as you yourself acknowledged the other day, Commissioner, to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the price paid to dairy producers no longer covers the current costs of production. What that means is that our producers are in the process of decapitalising. Just now, you listed the measures you have taken in the past nine months. Those measures do exist, we will grant you that. They have not, however, produced the anticipated effects because, in our view, they are not extensive enough, and there is definitely too much uncertainty about how effective their target is. This morning you mentioned a recovery in the market, but the producers will certainly only see the effects of this in the payments made at the beginning of next year. The agricultural products market is not the same as the market in metals or the energy market. It calls for regulatory tools, because the cycles of the seasons and nature also have an effect on market conditions. Your interpretation of the health check, carried out under the French Presidency, surprises us, since the interim assessments that it produced in relation to the dairy sector leave all avenues open, including the possibility of new decisions on tools for regulating the markets. The French delegation, to which I belong, is convinced that a renewed quotas system will be necessary after 2013. The tension that existed on the food products market prior to the current economic crisis has demonstrated the fragility of the balance across the world between production and consumption. After having partially dismantled the intervention tools, we have neither the right nor the legitimacy to dismantle today the production tools that we will need in the short term. Commissioner, we must give farmers back their dignity: these are men and women who are not afraid of hard work. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 Madam President, Mr Diamandouros, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let us give the People’s Europe a face. It is the responsibility of all the European institutions to do everything in their power so that citizens are informed of all their means of redress if there are violations of Community law or bad administration by European institutions. First of all, I would like to praise the work of my colleague, Mrs Nedelcheva, for her report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2009. The European Commission has been the object of most of the Ombudsman’s criticism, often for a lack of information. The report by my fellow Member, Mrs Paliadeli, whom I would also like to congratulate, is a glaring example. Next, I would like to thank our European Ombudsman for all the work that has been accomplished, together with his whole team, and for his accessibility and his excellent collaboration with the Committee on Petitions. This is very important. His role represents an important safeguard of respect for the principle of transparency and good administration, and it is there that we will obtain genuine protection for our fellow citizens. Finally, it is time that our fellow citizens were better informed of the means of redress available to them with regard to the European Commission: namely, the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions. In order to do that, we need an Internet portal, certainly, but we need a common one, as we have already requested from you. This would provide real help to our citizens. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 I did not wish to support this report insofar as an increase from 14 to 20 weeks on full pay would have catastrophic financial consequences for several Member States. The OECD study shows that there will be very substantial costs for the social budgets of Member States. For France, the annual amount is EUR 1.3 billion, and for the United Kingdom GBP 2.4 billion. In the current economic situation, increases in these budgets cannot be absorbed. What is more, businesses would have to bear these additional costs, which is impossible. However, supporting women during maternity is essential. Applying these measures poses a very great risk to the employment of women. The OECD study also shows that extending maternity leave would result in a decrease in female employment. In wishing to help women, there is a risk of penalising them in the job market. I wish to help women in their employment and to support them during maternity. The increase from 14 to 18 weeks proposed by the Commission was a real step forward. Another advance would have been to have progressive measures concerning childcare methods. Pascale Gruny  (PPE
),

Firstly, the fact that combating poverty has been taken into account in the 2020 strategy is, for me, a significant advance. The economic crisis has intensified the problem of poverty in recent years. The European Union must be able to encourage Member States to face up to this problem. Secondly, the European Social Fund (ESF) is an essential European tool in combating poverty. I am the rapporteur for the European Social Fund and I support its use in order to get back to work the people who are furthest away from the labour market. This has been the ESF’s role since it was set up under the Treaty of Rome, and it must keep employment as its prime objective. Thirdly, I am against a minimum income without contributing in return, except for people who are unfit for work. Employment is the benchmark in reducing poverty. It is the only way of giving back dignity to everyone. Fourthly, the governments of Member States have a responsibility to combat poverty actively. Europe is there to support them and to complement what they do but not to take their place. Europe cannot cure all ills. Above all, Member States must face up to their responsibilities. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need European legislation that will protect the health of pregnant women and women who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding, and we must rise to the demographic challenge we are facing and encourage an increase in birth rates in Europe. However, this advance must not serve as a disincentive to employ women. I would emphasise three points. Firstly, I welcome the European Commission’s proposal on the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. Indeed, I would emphasise the title, which is the legal framework of this directive, because too often, we tend to forget what exactly this text is about. We are talking here about women because, until we receive proof to the contrary, men cannot give birth. The debate tends to become diluted as a result of the reference made to paternity or parental leave. Let us solve the problem faced by women first, by focusing on their health when they bring a child into the world. We must implement genuine guarantees to protect the health of these women in the labour market. Paternity and parental leave will be dealt with in another directive. Secondly, the debate revolves around the number of weeks. Currently, the average leave period is set at 14 weeks. The European Commission is proposing 18 weeks and the report 20. Obviously, as a woman and mother of three children, I want mothers to be able to stay with their babies for as long as possible. However, this then begs the question: who is going to pay for this extension from 14 to 20 weeks? The state? Businesses? I am convinced that the average increase from 14 to 18 weeks is a major European advance and a real investment by our economy towards promoting a rise in birth rates in Europe. Twenty weeks is liable to have a negative impact on female employment: it would put a brake on their employment. Businesses and our States cannot support this additional huge financial burden at this time of crisis. Thirdly, more priority must be given to improving childcare so that mothers can achieve a work-life balance. Little progress has been made on this matter despite the many appeals by our Parliament. Therefore, let us not be counterproductive and let us not send women back home. Pascale Gruny  (PPE
).

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached a pivotal moment in the debate on the future of the European Social Fund (ESF). At a time when employment has become the number one preoccupation of all countries and all European regions, I am proud of the resolution Parliament has proposed today on the future of the ESF. This text is responsible, concrete and opens doors to the future. Now more than ever, our territories need a cohesion policy and thus, support from the European structural funds. The ESF has been in place since 1957 and was established by the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, the Treaty of Rome. Its legitimacy is not in doubt. My position on the future of the ESF is simple and clear and can be summarised in three points. First, a European Social Fund must remain focused on employment, combating poverty, of course, but by getting people into work and not by other means. Today, employment must have our full attention and must be our priority. I am convinced that a person who returns to employment is also a person who regains his human dignity. Second, an effective European Social Fund must have clear, pragmatic rules that do not discourage operators. That is why I support my political group, which is calling for greater visibility for the ESF, particularly to improve its uptake. Just imagine, budget allocations are sometimes returned unused to the European Union, while unemployment rates have never been so high. Third, and finally, we need a fund that is included in the broader framework of a strong European cohesion policy. Decisions must be taken on the ESF with partners that are as close to the ground as possible. Commissioners, can you assure us that the ESF will meet these expectations? Pascale Gruny,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Madam President, we need long-term legislation to improve employment in Europe and reduce poverty. We need to address the problem of unemployment with a view to sustainable growth. I should like to make three points. First of all, the Council proposes that the guidelines for employment policies in the Member States be established every 10 years. I agree, because we need a long-term perspective, but then we also need real milestones every three years to ensure that we do not lose sight of developments on the labour market. Secondly, I tabled an amendment, which was not adopted, in which I proposed that an employment observatory be established to conduct a specific analysis of future jobs. Many young people leave school or university without any training that meets the needs of the labour market. We need to anticipate future jobs. Our young people should be able to move forward and specialise by completing training which will ensure that they keep up with the employment market. Finally, the fight against unemployment not only entails doing everything to improve the employment situation in Europe, but also in combating poverty. The professional integration of people who have been out of work for a long time is vital in the fight against poverty. The European Social Fund is the instrument which can help bring these people back to the labour market. Let us start by giving these people their dignity back, by giving them jobs, and let us avoid helping them with no prospect of social integration. I would stress this point. Pascale Gruny,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Iturgaiz Angulo on his work. I agree with the content of the report, and do not wish to return to that particular subject. However, I would like to stress two important issues raised by Mr Iturgaiz Angulo. First of all, it is important to inform the citizens of the difference between the citizens’ initiative, the process of submitting a petition to the European Parliament, and the role of the European Ombudsman. There is still too much confusion regarding the role of each instrument. Secondly, when I go to meet citizens in my constituency, I realise that they have never heard of the right to submit a petition to the European Parliament. How can we ensure that the citizens have a clearer picture and that they are able to mobilise existing resources to their advantage? In view of this, it is vitally important for the European Parliament to possess better communication tools. Are you aware that no website currently exists to clearly explain how to submit a petition? By the same token, there is no information available to people submitting petitions which would allow them to follow, in real time, the progress of their petitions to Parliament. There is no good reason for this lack of transparency. A greater level of visibility is needed so that the citizens become aware of the fact that we are there to support them. Our committee exists and works for their benefit, and we are there to listen to them. The European Parliament must do everything within its power to close this communication gap and to highlight the work that has been carried out. This work is not of a legislative nature, that is true, but it is no less important. The citizens should be our main concern, and our committee works towards this objective each and every day. Pascale Gruny,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is only one lesson to be learned here, namely, that full-time contracts of an indefinite duration must remain the norm. First of all, I would like to thank all the colleagues who contributed to the drawing up of this report. Today, I am disappointed that a debate has not been held on a matter which lies at the heart of the 2020 strategy. A number of my colleagues wished to speak on the subject, but were not given the opportunity to do so. Nevertheless, I would strongly encourage them to submit their contributions, in written form, to Parliament’s services. I am also disappointed that, having worked closely with all the political groups to achieve an agreement after numerous consultations, an alternative resolution, which is almost identical to my report, has been tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. My group cannot support the two elements which Mrs Schroedter has added to the alternative resolution, and which the Committee had rejected in a vote. First of all, with regard to the basis of these proposals, which concern, above all, ‘false’ self-employed persons: it is true that these are a real, widespread problem. As the report mentions, we would like a better definition of self-employed persons, but we must also ensure that the criterion pertaining to non self-employed persons is clearly defined, rather than relying on the presumption of employee status. The definition proposed by the Greens is much more vague and does not provide any added value to the text adopted by the Committee. Secondly, with regard to the call for a directive to guarantee the same rights to all workers, including the right to freedom of association, irrespective of their professional status; I do not quite understand exactly to what rights this refers, or who is preventing employees or self-employed persons from joining or forming a union. In my opinion, it is pointless to call for such a directive, and the matter falls outside of the European institutions’ sphere of competence. In my report, I wanted to make full-time contracts of an indefinite duration the norm and condemn the exploitative replacement of regular jobs with atypical contracts. I would like to remind you that the principle of flexicurity implies not only flexibility, in order to adapt to the demands of the labour market but, above all, it also refers to job security, and the one principle cannot be implemented at the expense of the other. The European Union must intensify its efforts to invest in skills and training in order to support sustainable employment. The unemployment rate remains far too high in the European Union, and atypical contracts therefore do have a role to play on the labour market. With regard to young people, atypical contracts could, for example, provide them with their first experience of the labour market. If atypical contracts could provide young people with an opportunity, and make it easier for them to become salaried employees with contracts of an indefinite duration, then I would support these kinds of contracts. With regard to people who face a long period of unemployment, once again, if an atypical contract facilitates their transition back onto the labour market, then I am in favour of this kind of contract. Finally, if an atypical contract is used in the context of moving from one job to another or from one professional status to another, then, once again, I would support this kind of contract, as the main aim is to keep people in employment. I would also stress the vital role played by the social partners and civil society organisations in the drawing up and implementation of employment policies. I call on all the Member States to ensure their full participation, as all too often, their level of involvement varies from one Member State to another. Finally, we must ensure that they enjoy an improved level of recognition, at both social and institutional level. In this report, the European Parliament is sending out a strong signal to the governments of the Member States and to the Commission. Secure career paths are an essential aspect of a social Europe. The ball is now in the European Council’s court. I hope that the Council will stand by its resolutions in the field of employment, adopted in the spring of 2010. The European Union needs a clear focus and specific measures to protect employment in our regions and to create new opportunities, within the framework of the 2020 strategy. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 The directive that we are debating today is the fruit of very lengthy negotiations in the European Parliament over two mandates. This is a very sensitive issue, as it concerns our jobs both today and in the future. It is a matter of road safety and of fair competition between companies in the Member States. I would not accept social dumping within our Union itself. Could an independent driver work 14 hours a day, 84 hours a week, and not be a risk on the roads? Compared with a company-employed driver, this is unfair competition. This also leads some companies to suggest to their employees that they declare themselves self-employed. We must protect our fellow citizens and our companies. I therefore invite the European Commission to withdraw its proposal and, failing that, I call on MEPs, during tomorrow’s vote in plenary, to vote in favour of keeping self-employed workers within the scope of working time legislation. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the European Parliament is sending out a strong message to women who assist their spouses in their self-employed work. From now on, their social rights will be considerably enhanced, and I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, on the work she has done. Europe must protect. Under the new definition of ‘assisting spouse’, spouses and partners will be eligible for social protection in the event of sickness or retirement. Bakers’ spouses will now be able to benefit from social rights. It is regrettable, however, that the Council did not agree to compulsory membership, but simply adopted the system of voluntary membership. Maternity leave is also provided for all women. The new text provides for a minimum period of maternity leave for self-employed women and wives of self-employed workers throughout the European Union. The duration of this leave is currently set at 14 weeks. I am the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for the directive on the health and safety at work of pregnant workers. I sincerely hope that, with the adoption of this text, the duration of maternity leave will be increased; and why not subsequently increase it for self-employed women? To conclude, Europe has proposed some creative and pragmatic solutions to help couples to reconcile professional and family life. It is now time to switch to taking action and to implement the proposals as quickly as possible. Europe’s campaign to protect women is making headway with this text. However, we MEPs must continue to eliminate the inequalities between men and women. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all in agreement today in welcoming the measures to simplify the awarding of the Structural Funds proposed in Mr Kirilov’s report. Nevertheless, as Chair of Parliament’s Work Group on the European Social Fund, I am indignant at how long the review procedure that is currently in progress has taken. The Commission’s initial proposal dates from June 2009. Even though the purpose of this review was to help Member States combat the economic and social crisis, it took the Council six months to reach an agreement. That is unacceptable. It is true that the legislative procedure has been modified along the way to give Parliament the same amount of power as the Council. However, as the elected representatives of the European Union, we cannot today justify these delays to the public. I will now make a brief digression to welcome the responsibility shown by Parliament in agreeing as far as possible on the Council’s position in order not to delay the procedure any further. However, I would like to express my disappointment once again. We need a European Union that can take swift decisions that have a real impact on the ground. Now let us turn to the future for a moment. The simplification measures proposed today to combat the economic crisis are positive, but I would like to add that they could have been even more ambitious if the measures being applied to the current programming period, 2007-2013, had not been so clumsy and complicated. Therefore, looking ahead to the negotiations for the multiannual legislative framework for 2014-2020, I call on the European Parliament to demonstrate boldness in its proposals for the simplification of the administration and application of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.

Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the new online problem-solving network concerning cases of misapplication of internal market law, known as SOLVIT, is a very successful system insofar as it provides redress, without formal procedures, within approximately 10 weeks. Created in 2002, this network saw its workload increase by 22% in 2008. Even though the resolution rate remains quite high at 83%, the number of cases resolved is decreasing. It would seem to be time, eight years after it was created, to think about strengthening this institution by giving it the means to function effectively. These new measures would make it possible to help European citizens and businesses to assert their rights, especially with regard to the recognition of qualifications and of their social and residence entitlements. I therefore support the idea that not only should there be more SOLVIT staff in the Member States, but also that support and training measures should be put in place so that staff can function as efficiently as possible. It seems essential to me that governments and we ourselves, as elected representatives for our respective constituencies, should promote the SOLVIT network, which enabled cost savings of EUR 32.6 million in 2008. Furthermore, promoting this new tool would limit excessive recourse to the judicial system. I therefore call on the Member States to transpose all the European directives and make citizens and businesses aware of their rights within the internal market through national forms of media and information campaigns. To conclude, on behalf of my political group within the Committee on Petitions, I hope that cooperation between SOLVIT and our parliamentary committee will be strengthened so as to facilitate the work of these two bodies.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done, and our fellow Members for their hard work in creating this new microfinance instrument. This European instrument will make it possible to grant micro-credits to small enterprises and to people who have lost their jobs and want to set up their own small businesses. In this time of financial crisis, the most vulnerable people, especially the unemployed and young people, have been the worst affected. In fact, over 3.5 million job losses have been recorded this year in the European Union. The adoption of this new tool will make it easier for these people to access the capital required to set up or develop a business and make their dreams of entrepreneurship come true. We should not forget that over a third of micro-enterprises are created by unemployed people. In my region, I am often approached by citizens wishing to obtain aid to set up their own business. I am convinced that this new initiative will bear fruit in preserving jobs and that it will create new jobs too. The proposal will facilitate investments of low sums and will give micro-enterprises an opportunity to grow. Madam President, I would like to welcome the real added value of micro-credits, which will go hand in hand with new support measures, such as training and mentoring, which will enable the youngest people and the unemployed to obtain guarantees and assistance for their investment plans. I hope that this new instrument to promote employment will be adopted as soon as possible and that an agreement will be reached between Parliament and the Council on making this tool, which is vital for our fellow citizens, and particularly so during this crisis period, a permanent one. Ladies and gentlemen, let us not forget that it is small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every day in Europe, one in five women is a victim of violence. Violence against women is unacceptable, irrespective of the form it takes. Yet, in Europe, many women and young girls continue to live in the shadow of aggression or exploitation. The figures are alarming. Violence against women comes in many forms and occurs everywhere: domestic violence at home, sexual abuse, sexual harassment at work, rape, including within relationships, and also as a tactic of warfare outside Europe. In Europe, domestic violence is the main cause of death and disability among women between the ages of 16 and 44. As we debate these extremely serious matters, women are being assaulted. Talking about it is not enough. It is time for action. The European Union has a duty to protect its most vulnerable citizens. Fighting violence against women is a battle for fundamental human rights, and the Daphne Programme, which supports actions aimed at combating all forms of violence, is insufficient. New measures must be considered for the development of consistent European plans. I support the initiative of organising a European Year to combat violence against women, which our institution has been calling for now for more than a decade. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will not repeat all of the key points made by my fellow Members in relation to justice and immigration, but I did wish to point out that a European judicial area can only be established by enhancing mutual confidence among Member States, since that will improve the principle of mutual recognition, the cornerstone of the Europe of justice. Considerable progress has been made over the last 15 years, but there are still many weaknesses. I am delighted that the Treaty of Lisbon was finally ratified by all of the Member States during the negotiation of this text. The European Parliament will be able to have an equal say with the Council on matters relating to justice and home affairs; democratic legitimacy will be increased for the benefit of the citizens. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, I should like to stress that far too many complaints are referred to the Committee on Petitions concerning barriers to the freedom of movement of citizens within the European Union itself. I would also mention the problems linked to the mutual recognition of qualifications and to the right to social welfare benefits, as well as discrimination problems. The recognition of same-sex marriages, on the other hand, is an area that comes under the jurisdiction of the Member States. The Union must respect this national competence. I call on the European Commission to publish its guidelines as soon as possible so as to help the Member States’ authorities effectively combat breaches of the principle of free movement. Citizens must be able to move freely and to make full use of their rights in this area without internal borders. I am delighted to see that, in the resolution, the European Union’s anti-drug strategy has a place in the creation of this European judicial area. However, I hope that the European Union will show more initiative in this regard. Why does the Union not equip itself with new weapons for combating this growing trend, which affects our children at an increasingly early age? They are the future. What are we doing to protect them? Let us finally show some sense of pragmatism in our institutions! That is what our fellow citizens expect from us. Pascale Gruny,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), to congratulate the rapporteur most sincerely on the work she has done and on the spirit of cooperation she has shown throughout the process of drafting this report. We are giving our verdict today on the annual report on the European Ombudsman’s activities, which was presented on 21 April. Appointed by the European Parliament, the Ombudsman gives us a formal account, via this report, of all the results of his inquiries into complaints concerning cases of maladministration within our European institutions and agencies. His role, which is of the utmost importance, represents an essential guarantee that the principles of transparency and good administration will be respected and therefore constitutes a genuine form of protection for our fellow citizens in cases of injustice, discrimination, abuses of power, outstanding responses and delayed information. Indeed, in this report we note the increasing number of complaints lodged with the Ombudsman. The majority concern the European Commission, the institution that, admittedly, comprises the largest number of officials, but essentially, they are cases of an alleged lack of transparency. The fact remains that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. Coming back to the report, the Committee on Petitions approved it by a large majority on 1 October. Our Ombudsman has carried out his job of examining and processing the complaints in an active and balanced way. In particular, he has always been able to maintain good relations with and between the institutions, which has helped the institutions and agencies in question to accept an amicable solution or to settle certain disputes, with a few exceptions. Moreover, the Ombudsman serves as a resource for the institutions. He helps them to improve their performance by drawing their attention to areas for improvement, the ultimate goal being to improve the service to be provided to our fellow citizens. The report that we have adopted in committee underlines and points out the importance of the adoption of a code of good administrative behaviour by all of the European institutions and agencies, a code that was already approved by the European Parliament eight years ago. This repeated call by our committee must not remain unanswered. Europeans deserve nothing less. The right to good administration by the institutions and bodies of the European Union is a fundamental right laid down in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union included in Part II of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is no longer a fantasy but a reality. Lastly, I feel the need to point out that the Ombudsman reserves the right to scrutinise the work of the Commission and must ensure that the latter makes proper use of its discretionary power to start infringement proceedings or to propose sanctions. Pascale Gruny  (PPE

The state of the dairy market has worsened considerably over the last 12 months: the price of milk has fallen by 30% in a year, which is the sharpest fall seen in the last 20 years. We therefore urgently need to introduce new forms of regulation at European level to ensure that the dairy sector is not just dependent on the rules of the market but can actually prove a match for them. Currently, the instability in producers’ incomes does not allow the best allocation to be made of resources that are vital for future investments in the sector. Therefore, the European Commission has a duty to facilitate contractual relations within the agri-food chain, so as to balance the relations between the various operators in the sector, stabilise the markets and prevent market risks. It must also encourage better organisation within the sectors. In addition, consideration should be given to whether an increase in milk quotas might have a positive impact on producer prices. Europe must act now. We can wait no longer. If we do not act, we will run the risk of seeing the European dairy sector suffer lasting damage, thus depriving our fragile rural areas of the hub of their economies.
