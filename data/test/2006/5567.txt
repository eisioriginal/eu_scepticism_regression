 Mr President, this morning we will be voting on a joint motion for a resolution co-signed by four political groups on the situation of the Ashraf refugee camp in Iraq. Three thousand five hundred Iranian men and women, members of the democratic opposition to the fundamentalist regime in Iran, live there completely defenceless. In the last few weeks they have been under pressure and harassment by the faction of the Iraqi Government under the influence of the Iranian regime, and there is a high probability that at any moment a tragedy could happen that would parallel the ones we witnessed in the Balkans not so long ago. We all remember Srebrenica, and I have no doubt that no Member in this Chamber wants a second Srebrenica in Iraq. Our motion for a resolution is a call to alert public opinion all over the world before a disaster takes place. Unfortunately, some colleagues have tabled amendments that could increase the danger for the residents in Camp Ashraf and provide the Iranian regime and its proxies in Iraq with arguments to massacre them. I recently visited the camp myself and I assure you that the allegations included in the amendments tabled are absolutely unfounded. People in Ashraf are there on a volunteer basis. They are free to leave whenever they want and they live in the best friendly relations with the Iraqi population of the region. The intention of our motion is to protect these people. Nobody would understand – but if these amendments are adopted the result of the motion would be exactly the opposite. This is not a political issue, colleagues: it is purely humanitarian and it is very urgent. I beg you to vote against all amendments tabled to this joint motion supported by these four groups and support the motion as it has been agreed by these four groups that are of very different political stances. The lives of many innocent and harmless people depend on your vote. Please do not let them down.
 President.  
– We shall now proceed to the vote. (For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
 - Before the vote:
 President.  
– Thank you very much. That is enough, ladies and gentlemen. We shall proceed with the session. Mr Titley, your complaint will be immediately passed to the Office of the President with your request that they should respond to it immediately. As regards the question asked by Mr Cohn-Bendit, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, any member of the House is naturally entitled to declare at any time, a personal interest in relation to any matter being discussed here. Therefore, there is nothing further to say on this matter, he who wishes to say something may say it, and he who does not wish to, may remain silent. As such, I consider this matter resolved.
 President. − 
 I would now like to welcome a delegation from Iraq, on the occasion of their visit to our Parliament. I would like to extend a cordial welcome to them within the framework of our interparliamentary meetings. (Applause)
 Mr Khalid Al Atiyah, First Vice-President of the House of Representatives of the Republic of Iraq, chairs this delegation. It gives me great pleasure to emphasise the encouraging progress made in Iraq on matters of security and the rule of law, to which the provincial elections held last January bear witness, and we hope that the many problems and difficult years that this country has experienced will very soon be overcome. They can rest assured that the European Union and this Parliament will always be at their side to help them to consolidate the peace, democracy, and stability to which Iraq, like any other nation on earth, has a right. I hope that the meetings held within our Parliament will be fruitful, and that your stay amongst us will allow the bonds that unite our two Parliaments to be strengthened. (Applause)
 President. − 
 Yes, Mr Gahler, I would like very much to do as you wish, and I have in fact done that in the past. I am not doing it today because the Association of European Journalists has asked that we detail the votes. If we do not, the result cannot be duly recorded, and they rightly state that if they do not know the result of the vote, they cannot make a political assessment as to the position of the House.
 President. − 
 Thank you Mrs Ţicău, we take due note of your observation. - Before the vote on Amendments 109 and 124:
 President. − 
 Yes, you are correct Mr Jarzembowski: Amendment 12 falls.
 President.  
– Could the rapporteur, Mr Albertini, give us his opinion?
 President.  
– Thank you, Mrs Bowles. It is appropriate that we should hear the opinion of the rapporteur, Mr Crowley.
 President. − 
 Thank you very much for the advice, Mr Alvaro. Of course, it is obvious that you have no experience of this.
 President. − 
 Mrs Liotard, we will now vote on Amendment 158, which is a motion for rejection, and once we have that result I will respond to your observation. I should like to make a proposal regarding the amendments dealing with the legal base: the Presidency must decide on the admissibility of these amendments, specifically, Amendments 159, 119, 116 and 125, but the decision naturally has to depend on the final configuration of the directive, which will be modified in the course of voting. Therefore, I propose that the vote on the admissibility of these amendments should take place at the end, since at that point the Presidency will have the facts it needs to decide whether or not they are admissible. Otherwise, we would have to decide now without sufficient information. Therefore, if the honourable spokesmen agree, voting will be taken on these amendments at the end.
 President.  
– We will therefore vote on 80 amendments from the appropriate committee, and we are aware that Mr Bushill-Matthews wishes to table an oral amendment to Amendment 100. - Before the vote on Amendment 100:
 President. -  
So far, in voting on this report, we have voted on a series of amendments affecting Articles 15, 16 and 17. The adopted amendments affecting those articles are the following: 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110 and 135. During the debate, Commissioner Vassiliou said that she would be prepared to review the legal base if she felt there were reasons to do so, which would depend on the amendment of the directive. We must decide on the admissibility of Amendments 159, 119, 116, 125 and 126.1, in order to ensure that the final text adopted by Parliament corresponds with the legal base. Taking into account what the Commissioner has said, and the fact that the appropriate committee voted on these amendments, that is, the appropriate committee and as such, the chair of the appropriate committee, considered them to be admissible; since he allowed them to be voted on, and also taking into account all that we have voted on today in relation to Articles 15, 16, and 17, I note that the directive has changed direction. Taking all of this into account, the Presidency considers the amendments admissible, and we shall now proceed to vote on them.
 President. − 
 Mr McMillan-Scott, up until now we have accommodated the speakers. From now on, we are going to move things along more swiftly and thus satisfy everyone. - After the vote:
 President. − 
 It is indeed an appropriate moment to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for his work, and to wish him a speedy and happy recovery.
 President. − 
 Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make a proposal: as there are a number of you who have requested several explanations of vote, when I give you the floor, please provide all your explanations, in sequence, in one speech.
 President. − 
 I was unaware that you possessed such a talent for rhapsody. You recited it very well.

 Alejo Vidal-Quadras,  
rapporteur. 
− Madam President, I would like to start by sincerely thanking the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, Commissioner Piebalgs and Ambassador Reinišová for the excellent cooperation during the first three months of this year. That cooperation has been the main engine of the successful outcome we will be voting on this week. Negotiations have been long, complex and sometimes tough, but I think we have managed to get an agreement that is satisfactory to all parties. Regarding the overall package, as it has been negotiated, Parliament can be proud of the final text. Indeed, our very strong first-reading agreement on ownership unbundling gave the negotiating team a lot of leverage during the talks. This has allowed us to obtain a much tighter regulatory framework, in particular in countries with the ITO model in place, where the competencies of national regulators will be increased, with independence from both governments and industry. This new role will reduce the risk of uncompetitive behaviour, especially in circumstances where vertically integrated companies abuse their position to stop investments in new capacity. Furthermore, agreement has been reached on the review clause that will allow us to check, in a few years, whether all models satisfy our goals of achieving a fully competitive and legalised market. Moreover, we have substantially increased the provisions on consumer protection with regard to, among other things, billing information and improved conditions for switching suppliers. Finally, another big success has been the introduction of a new provision in the third-country clause, whereby the certification of a transmission system operator (TSO) from a third country could now also be denied if the security of supply of the Union as a whole, or that of an individual Member State, other than the one where the certification is requested, is threatened. Concerning the electricity regulation, I would like to make clear that this regulation plays a crucial role, since it gives Member States the tools needed to significantly increase interconnection capacity within the Union by the development and establishment of binding network codes to be applied by all transmission system operators to exchanges, thus removing one of the main physical barriers to the completion of the internal electricity market. The agreed text also enhances the role of the Agency for the Cooperation of European Regulators in this process, in line with the first reading in the European Parliament. I must admit that Parliament hoped for a much more ambitious agency. However, we understand that this is only the first step in a long process of integration of regulatory frameworks. We have managed to include a new provision whereby the Agency will be able to propose the basic criteria to be included in the granting of exemptions for new interconnections. This is particularly relevant since it is one of the main obstacles investors in new capacity face when dealing with different Member States. Having to follow several different regulatory procedures can sometimes lead to confusing results and put off investors – take, for example, Nabucco. This regulation also establishes, and gives a defined role to, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO), which will be in charge of drafting the network codes to be submitted to the Agency, as well as developing coordinated mechanisms for emergency situations such as the European Union-wide blackouts we have suffered in the recent past. I would like to finish by thanking all the technical staff, whose work has enabled us to obtain an agreement which, at the very beginning of the negotiations, we at times lost faith in reaching.

 – (ES)
 We have to acknowledge the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that there is a somewhat bittersweet flavour to today’s debate and tomorrow’s vote in this House, which have both a light and a dark side. The dark side is that the intensity and speed of this procedure that we have undertaken have left a large number of Members of this House feeling cut off and excluded from much of the debate on a package of measures that we all know is surely the most important one in this parliamentary term. On the light side, I am convinced that the outcome of these marathon negotiations is, we can finally say, satisfactory. This is a joint debate on the whole package, but right now we are talking about the renewables directive, and I would like to highlight some points specifically about this subject. First, it rightly keeps the proportion of biofuels at 10%, because if we have a problem in Europe it is the problem of security of supply. The national support plans, which are continuing as well, have been very successful in certain Member States, particularly in Spain. The fact that these are being maintained is, therefore, also very good news in my view. The flexibility mechanisms are aimed at helping those Member States with less potential to take part in this ambitious project to boost renewables, by joining forces with those Member States that have great potential. This too is a highly positive contribution. Furthermore, this renewables directive is surely sending to Europe’s industries a very strong, clear message that will encourage them to act with confidence and certainty. That will open up huge business and job creation opportunities, both within Europe and globally. In short, this package of legislation is opening up a new era of commitment to environmental quality of such size and scope ... (The President cut off the speaker)

 Ana Mato Adrover (PPE-DE

 – (ES) 
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Jacek Protasiewicz on the efforts he is making to find consensus and I hope that he will be successful tomorrow. There is no doubt that a joint reflection was needed on what the rules for regulating the labour market mean, and I believe that the Green Paper has offered a good opportunity to do that. New challenges and problems have arisen since the Luxembourg Summit, such as immigration and the ageing of the population, and in 1997 – we remember the objective was simply to incentivise the creation of jobs. Today, in an era of greater economic dynamism, we are advocating not just full employment but also high-quality employment. By that I mean that we are seeking better working conditions, greater business management efficiency, reconciliation of family and working life, life-long learning and also stability. That is where I have my first reservation about the report. Stability cannot be incompatible with part-time contracts. The report rules out this kind of contract and only advocates full-time contracts, forgetting how necessary part-time contracts, which can be indefinite and stable, are to the reconciliation of work and family life. The report also criminalises and forgets temporary contracts, which are crucial and irreplaceable in certain sectors, such as tourism, catering, construction and agriculture, in which it would be unthinkable to draw up indefinite contracts, given the role they play. Another reservation I would like to stress is that we know that labour systems vary enormously from one country to another. So do industrial relations, and it is therefore very difficult to produce joint legislation at European level. We are more in favour of subsidiarity, and also the open coordination method and agreement amongst social agents. Naturally, we do not want to give the Commission a blank cheque to act on labour law issues without taking account of the different countries and the different characteristics that each of them have.

Europe is currently facing two great challenges: on the one hand, economic globalisation and, on the other, the ageing of the population, and all of this combined with the phenomenon of immigration. Both require clear modernisation of the European social model. As you know, competitiveness is the key element in terms of facing the challenge of globalisation. We all know that we cannot compete with the emerging countries in terms of labour costs, but we have a clear advantage, our human capital, given its capacity, its flexibility and its creativity, and we also have the crucial values of solidarity, equal opportunities and inclusiveness. With regard to the ageing of the population, in order to confront this challenge and to be able to guarantee pensions and healthcare in the future, it is essential that we increase productivity, and amongst other things that requires more jobs and also better quality jobs. There is a general consensus amongst the Member States that it is necessary to modernise legislation in the field of employment protection. In this regard, the combination of flexibility and security, which we often call ‘flexisecurity’, is a key element that must be developed in the future. We also need, firstly, to apply a strategy of active ageing, with more training for people over 45 and with financial and tax incentives to extend working lives beyond 65. Secondly, to guarantee an appropriate immigration policy, in accordance with a proposal that is based on a broad European agreement enabling it to be controlled in an ordered fashion and immigrants to be integrated by means of training and recycling plans suited to their profiles. Finally, to promote a reform of public pensions systems with a view to ensuring that they are sustainable through consolidation of public finances and incentives to supplement them by means of individual plans. I shall end, ladies and gentlemen, by stating that we still have a long way to go in order to achieve an effective and inclusive European labour market, which above all is focussed on life-long employment, and in which everybody, regardless of their age and conditions, receives the assistance and opportunities they require.

Madam President, Commissioner Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important day for this House and I would therefore like to congratulate Mrs Lynne on her report, because we are taking a further step in our task of building a Europe of opportunities. By means of a broad agreement, we shall approve new measures today that will represent progress in terms of equal opportunities for people with any kind of disability. I believe that this new European Action Plan 2006-2007 is a great challenge in terms of eliminating any kind of discrimination and, furthermore, it tackles the needs of people with disabilities throughout Europe. I shall highlight several issues. Firstly, it intends to establish a general framework for equal treatment in work, not just in terms of education and access, but also promotion and lifelong learning. Secondly, it undoubtedly improves the conditions and rights for passengers with disabilities using air, sea and land transport. I must warn you, however — as I have done in the report — of the need not to create a new and so far non-existent barrier: the economic barrier. To oblige people with disabilities to be accompanied is positive in terms of improving the quality of their journey, but it would not be a positive thing for the disabled person to have to pay for the ticket of the person accompanying them, since that would mean those people having to pay for two tickets, while the rest of us would only have to pay for one. Thirdly, the improvement in access to new technologies. There is no question that new technologies should break down many barriers for people with disabilities, provided that we achieve universal access to them and provided that technological advances take these people into account from the outset of their design stage. Fourthly, we need integrated and coordinated responses to disability amongst children and amongst people who are already suffering other forms of discrimination, such as women and the elderly. Finally, the prevention of work risks. We have opted for a broad agreement on work-related risks, which has already been presented in this House, and which the Commission has not yet taken up — and I would remind you of this, Mr Špidla — and in which particular attention will have to be paid to the possible risks faced by people in the workplace. I would also like to stress the extremely important role played by disabled people’s associations. There is no question that this is a great challenge and that it represents progress towards achieving the Europe of opportunities that we all want to see.

Mr President, this report that we are debating today on a European social model for the future, in relation to which I would like in particular to acknowledge the consensus that has been achieved between the two large political groups – and I would like especially to mention Mr José Silva Peneda and also Mr Proinsias De Rossa for their efforts – is good news, since it is destined to contribute to solidarity, greater social cohesion, greater quality of life and a more sustainable future for Europe’s social security systems. There is no doubt that the Europe of the citizens to which we all aspire requires more and more coordinated policies that allow us to tackle the new challenges that we face every day. For example, demographic change with higher life expectancies, which has been mentioned here this afternoon, undoubtedly obliges us to adopt new policies, and not just health policies, but also socio-health care policies which will allow us to combine the higher life expectancy with greater quality of life. Full employment, temporary work, youth unemployment and women’s unemployment require an ambitious employment policy, which promotes the stability and security of jobs. The same goes for the incorporation of women into working life, where we need innovative formulae for reconciling work and family life and for making working hours more flexible. We must also deal with immigration, which I see more as a challenge than a problem. This summer, more than ever, we are witnessing the drama of immigration in my country, and it is causing serious human problems. Without prejudice to the attitude of the Spanish Socialist Government, which has raised false expectations and has therefore helped to aggravate this serious problem, this situation affects the whole of Europe and hence requires cooperative and effective measures on our part. I believe that it is important that we consider a European immigration policy, and it is important that we say so today, when we are talking about the European social model, because the phenomenon of immigration is going to have a great impact on the European social model throughout Europe. I therefore believe that we should continue working in favour of this European social model, while taking account of all the challenges facing us, and that of immigration in particular.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by stressing the good work and wonderful cooperation of the rapporteur, Mrs Kósáné Kovács, and I would like to congratulate her on her efforts and the report she has presented. As we know, scarcely a year ago, the employment guidelines were approved, and it was my honour to be rapporteur on that occasion. Those guidelines established the general approach to employment and the priorities for the next three years, and their purpose was to make an effective contribution to employment growth, the productivity of the economy and, of course, strengthening social inclusion and cohesion. These guidelines, which were debated jointly with the economic policy guidelines, which this year have been presented brilliantly by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, have been taken up and translated into concrete objectives in the national reform plans, approved scarcely six months ago by the Member States. Both through common sense – they were approved scarcely a year ago and they are for three years – and as a result of the content of the guidelines themselves, we have simply updated them. Of what has this updating consisted? Three broad areas. Firstly, we have taken up the priority issues that have been highlighted at the big European summits held this year: firstly, investment in research, development and innovation and the spread of information technologies, an aspect which is furthest from achieving the Lisbon objectives; secondly, genuine and effective equality of opportunities, which our group has always advocated, and which includes the incorporation of women, permanent positions for them and their promotion in the workplace and, of course, equal pay; and, thirdly, we strongly advocate stable employment, and I say this because the majority of work that is being created is precarious. In my country, for example, 52% of all work created over the last two years has been temporary work, and that is unacceptable. Secondly, we have repeated certain fundamental issues which have not been adequately dealt with by the Commission. In the fight against accidents in the workplace we advocated a broad agreement at European level, which we believe to be essential, since in Spain, for example, 990 people lost their lives in 2005, and also help for the victims of domestic violence in finding work. Finally, since we are now updating them, we want this Parliament to be able to monitor the employment guidelines and compliance with them by the Member States. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the Lisbon Council in 2000, the European Union’s economy has been negatively affected by various events which have led to much less growth than we had expected and, at the moment, we are still very far from achieving the objectives set in Lisbon. Last February, the Commission approved a document entitled ‘Working together for growth and jobs – a new start for the Lisbon Strategy’, which clearly pointed out that if Europe wanted to carry on aspiring to become the most dynamic and most competitive economic area in the world by 2010, the Lisbon Strategy had to be reoriented and had to focus on two clear objectives: firstly, economic growth and, secondly, employment. One consequence of that is the presentation of the economic and employment policy guidelines, for the first time integrated and for a period of 3 years, which will have to be incorporated into national reform programmes, which will also be innovative. These guidelines are based on the notion that economic growth can make a decisive contribution to job creation and that that is the best guarantee for social provision. I would like to thank you for the more than 90 amendments presented, which have become fourteen compromises approved almost unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and which I intend to retain today for the sake of coherence and also out of respect for the Members that have signed them. I will therefore reject the seven amendments by the Group of the Greens, which, in fact, have already been debated and taken up, in part, in the compromises and accepted by the different parliamentary groups. It would appear logical that, since we have all given ground, following arduous work, in order to reach a consensus on a good report that could be supported by a large majority, we should support that report today. I would like in particular to thank the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, which presented a perfect text from a gender perspective that has been taken up, practically in its entirety, in the compromises and guidelines introduced as amendments. Thank you very much for the work you have done. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that, during the parliamentary negotiations, we have managed to improve the Commission's text by extending it and introducing new issues. Firstly, the reconciliation of family and work life: such important aspects as the equal distribution of family responsibilities between couples, support for flexible work patterns, in particular part-time work, paternity leave or facilities for the care of children or other dependent persons, in particular the elderly, in accordance with the objectives set at the Barcelona Summit in 2002. Secondly, the fight against workplace accidents. The report advocates prevention and we recommend the establishment of a broad agreement at European level to combat workplace accidents, which cause so many deaths throughout Europe. Thirdly, and very importantly, the phenomenon of immigration. We advocate the integration of legal immigrants and the eradication of all types of racist behaviour. Fourthly, training and education: improving all types of education and supporting professional training, which must cease to be the poor relation of university education, lifelong learning, new technologies and the promotion of entrepreneurial spirit, languages and exchange programmes between teachers and students. Fifthly, the fight against the scourge of domestic violence: employment plans for women who are victims of gender violence. Sixthly, our commitment to social cohesion and inclusion and to combating employment discrimination, supporting integrated action and the adoption of all measures necessary to guarantee that labour markets are open to job seekers, in particular women, young people, the elderly and people suffering any type of disability. The text, and also the contributions of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, include a whole range of measures to guarantee real equality between men and women, not just with regard to access to jobs, but also with regard to other issues, such as salaries, professional promotion and harassment. Seventhly, employment for the elderly and gradual and flexible retirement. We are promoting participation in the labour market by the elderly and the voluntary extension of working life by means of measures to incentivise work and make early retirement less attractive. And finally, the report introduces other issues, such as the environment, sustainable development and the social economy, and promotes the work of cooperatives and the voluntary sector, the role of regional and local authorities and the quest for new sources of employment, which is very important. In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the report we are debating today is going to enrich and improve the text originally proposed by the Commission. I would therefore like once again to thank very warmly all the Members who have presented amendments, not just for their interest, but also for their willingness to reach agreement, since, thanks to their work, the guidelines that we will at last approve today will allow the European Employment Strategy to contribute more effectively to achieving the objectives set at Lisbon, which, in the field of employment, are quite simply to achieve full and better-quality employment by 2010.

Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my generally negative view of the report presented by Mrs Figueiredo, since its content runs counter to the economic and social policy advocated by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Though it is true that the text has been improved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it is also the case that it retains a tone which is clearly in favour of interventionism, and all the factors that mean economic and social development in the European Union, such as private initiative, the market or competition policy, are forgotten and relegated to second place. In short, this report defends policies and formulas that have traditionally been advocated by the European left. Our first amendment, therefore, is intended to highlight the important role of private initiative in the Union’s development. With regard to paragraph 1, as other rapporteurs have mentioned, I believe that its wording is particularly inappropriate. A reading of it would suggest that the European Union’s unemployment problems are due to the Stability Pact, the Lisbon Strategy, the internal market or competition policy. It is precisely these factors, I believe, that need to be strengthened if we want to ensure that the Union grows, creates employment and enjoys greater social cohesion. And this is the case, for example, in my country, Spain, as has been demonstrated, where over recent years, an economic policy based on the balance of public accounts, tax reductions and the implementation of liberalising reforms in key sectors has led to the creation of five million jobs. As the High-Level Group chaired by Wim Kok has recognised, the problem stems from the lack of commitment on the part of some Member States to the reforms necessary for implementing strategies, rather than the strategy itself. Finally, our only intention with the rest of the amendments is for this Parliament to reflect the concern at the problems faced by young people in terms of accessing the labour market, as well as the need to remove the fiscal and administrative barriers faced by European entrepreneurs. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, there is one initial, major objection that has to be raised against this proposal: that is, its total failure to consult the sector concerned. It is unacceptable for the Commission to continue stating that its whole fishing policy is to be based on talks with stakeholders, at the exact same time as it is drafting a regulation that is to have the most serious, immediate consequences for the fleet, when the industry is, in fact, deprived of such dialogue or prior consultation. This is a bad start to an attempt to establish the culture of compliance to which the Commission so often refers. The timing of this is also highly questionable. While it is true that the control policy is one of the most resounding failures of the Common Fisheries Policy, it is also true that the Commission has maintained it since 1993 and has decided to modify it just as it presents a draft report on the reform of the CFP announcing a complete review of the conservation and management system. Given that control is a permanent feature of any management system, it would have been much more sensible to coordinate both reforms without running the risk of the 2012 reform leaving this proposal obsolete; some of its measures are not even due to come into effect until 2012 at the earliest. These two major errors detract from what could have been real successes, such as the attempts to harmonise infringements and sanctions, and the objective of holding Member States definitively responsible for the clear lack of political will to apply control measures. Mr President, it only remains for me to thank the rapporteur for his work and say that I am sorry we have so little time to deal with such an important matter.
 Carmen Fraga Estévez,  
deputising for the rapporteur.
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for highlighting some of the main concerns raised by the Commission’s proposal. One is the new tendency to regulate individual areas of issues that are pillars of the common policy. While this approach may, in theory, be understandable in the case of technical measures, we must be very careful to make sure that subsequent regional regulations are limited to aspects relating solely to the application and regulation of technical details. I mention this because drawing up framework regulations containing minimum measures which are then followed by different laws for individual areas is, together with an increasing tendency to turn to comitology, one of the options the Commission is prepared to take if faced with the prospect of a codecision procedure on fisheries, as the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries itself freely admits in the Green Paper on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. We should also bear in mind that it is not an ordinary policy we are talking about here, but a common policy, which requires total clarity as regards what may be involved in a more or less covert handing-over of control to Member States or an excessive territorialisation of what should be common rules intended not to disrupt competition and to avoid discrimination among fleets. Therefore, while it may be reasonable for very local species to have their minimum size regulated by regional regulations, those cases should make up the lowest number; minimum sizes in general, like measurements of nets or criteria according to which catches can be unloaded and sold, should be universal and adopted by the Council and Parliament. Some of the main changes introduced by the Committee on Fisheries also move in that direction, trying to limit any application of the comitology procedure to details alone and insisting that the Council should have rules at its disposal in order to establish seasonal closures, net dimensions and measures to eliminate or reduce discards, for we understand that all Community fisheries have to be bound by certain rules that are the same for everyone. It should be remembered that the only truly communitised aspect of this policy that we call ‘common’ is access to markets, while the conservation and management policy – let us stop calling it a control policy – leaves certain room for manoeuvre that Member States generally have no qualms in using to the benefit of their fleets and to the detriment of those of others. We have just witnessed the Commission’s strong commitment to communitising and standardising control, and it would prove difficult to understand the way in which the remaining measures serve, on the contrary, to break up and fragment that control, or the fact that different rules are created for the same activity, depending on where it is carried out. This jeopardises the entire credibility of the Common Fisheries Policy and its own future as such, something that should not be assumed before the 2012 reform. Finally, with regard to the controversial ‘one net’ rule, I believe that Parliament has offered the Commission a good alternative approach, indicating in which cases this may be unviable; it should, therefore, be acceptable to take more than one fishing net on board. Hence, I hope the Commission can show sensitivity to what are clearly major concerns for the fishing industry and our own Committee on Fisheries.

 Mr President, I am grateful to the commissioner for one comment he made in particular, which is that he is prepared to reconsider the Commission’s position on the issue of comitology. I welcome the news because Parliament has clearly shown that, throughout this debate in the Committee on Fisheries, it does not agree with the Commission’s keenness – also apparent in the draft Green Paper on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy – to turn to the subject of comitology excessively and with particular interest. In addition, the Commission justifies this in the Green Paper, alleging that proceedings may now be delayed, given the codecision procedure that Parliament is going to apply to the area of fisheries for the first time, once the Treaty of Lisbon comes into effect. I do not believe this to be true; I feel that legislative procedures are often delayed not because of Parliament or the codecision procedure but, rather, because sometimes the Commission is also late in presenting its proposals. In my view, this is a matter of interest and one that should be debated. I understand the commissioner’s point when he says that with a regulation as technical as this one, some aspects have to be decided by comitology and cannot all be dealt with by the Council. However, I think, Commissioner, that there is a certain difference between what you consider to be ‘technical’ and what we in Parliament consider to be ‘technical’. We are more restrictive than you tend to be. As a final point – I do not wish to spend too long on a matter for which I am not the rapporteur – I wish to mention the one net rule. Commissioner, during the debates we had in the Committee on Fisheries, it became apparent that the Commission defends this principle chiefly for reasons of control. We all understand that the issue of control is a great deal simpler with the single net rule, but this matter also poses serious problems for certain fisheries, as you are indeed aware. Therefore, let us not always use the issue of control in order to be highly restrictive at times, for some decisions do not always need to be made.

 Mr President, my political group voted in favour of the urgent procedure for the recovery plan for bluefin tuna because it is essential that the new measures should be in force before the season begins in April. I would also like to remind everyone, however, that no recovery plan will save the bluefin tuna until fishing capacity is reduced, starting with that of certain Community fleets, which are well-known and have been pointed out in this respect for many years. For all these years, the Member States in question have allowed their vessels to multiply to scandalous levels, while the European Commission has stood by passively. That has brought us to this situation, in which there is hardly any way out. When the current recovery plan was adopted in 2007, I tabled an amendment, which was adopted by the House and incorporated by the Commission in its final text, obliging the Member States to submit fishing plans showing that their fleet capacity was adapted to the quota allocated to it. Despite that, the fishery again had to be closed early in 2008, earlier in fact than in the previous year, when it was found that practically the whole Community quota had been used up in just a few weeks; that is to say, we were doing even worse. Article 5 of the new recovery plan now obliges Member States with overcapacity to eliminate at least 25% of it by 2010. Not only does that reduction seem to me to be incredibly mild compared with the excesses that have been committed, but, given the precedents, I am exceedingly concerned at the ability of the Commission and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) to enforce this obligation, in view of the clear lack of political will that the Member States involved have more than demonstrated. I therefore beg the Commissioner to give us guarantees here and now that this lack of political will will not rub off on the Commission and that this time, the Commission will show some firm action that goes beyond closing the fishery early again this spring.

 Madam President, as regards the plans for the fisheries policy, certain proposals that we have been waiting for have been so long coming that what we now need is a fixed work programme allowing us to determine with greater certainty those issues that will come before us in this parliamentary term. Despite our requests in this respect, and aside from the reform of the monitoring policy which has just been presented, we have so far been unable to obtain any better idea of what is to come. The Commission document tells us that one of the priorities will be the presentation of the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy. However, in reality, this simply represents the start of a debate which will not end until 2012. The promised reform of the common organisation of the markets also appears in the communication, but we are again unsure whether this will reach us in the first half of 2009. I want to point out that there is a whole series of issues which, either because of international commitments, such as fisheries agreements, or multilateral obligations, such as the need to transpose the recommendations of the regional fisheries organisations into Community law, should appear in the legislative programme. There are also other issues, such as the future of European aquaculture or the proposal on discards which appears and disappears like a ghost from the Commission’s work programmes, which we believe should also become priority issues, given the importance attributed to them by both the sector and this Parliament. We therefore hope, Madam President, that an amended work programme for 2009 will be presented as soon as possible, taking into account these repeated requests from the European Parliament.

 I have just attended a meeting of the Long Distance Fleet Regional Advisory Council, and I could see the enormous concern for the fate of 51 vessels and around 1 500 crew of the Community tuna fleet that fishes in the Indian Ocean. For years the fleet has been reporting incidents of piracy in the area adjoining Somalia, but not even the capture of the Spanish tuna boat Playa de Bakio
 in April caused some governments to react in time, including my own, unfortunately, until, in recent days, the fleet had to withdraw to the port of Victoria, and from that point, the measures taken have been highly inadequate. We need to understand that fishermen live in an especially dangerous situation as, while all the vessels passing through the area are cause for concern, the merchant vessels tend to have established routes, which provides greater opportunity to monitor them as they pass through. Those 51 fishing boats, however, are scattered, following the migrations of tuna, over an area of more than 3 200 square miles, which is five days’ sailing, and they are therefore much more vulnerable, so a naval operation is essential and urgent. In addition to what has been said about the Strait of Malacca, in addition to Somalia, we are now receiving reports from the fishing fleet about piracy in the Mozambique Channel and in areas of India and the Caribbean. We cannot, therefore, remain inactive, and we need to react, in addition to the reactions that may come from our governments and the Council. All the Community institutions are involved in creating a coordinated strategy to combat international piracy. I have therefore proposed to my political group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, an amendment to the budget in order to allocate one million euros to studying a viability plan for implementing this strategy, and I ask Parliament to give it the green light, so that all Community citizens, wherever they are, receive the message that the European Union is supporting them and, above all, protecting them.

 Mr President, I would like to say that, once again, we have worked very hard in the Committee on Fisheries so that the Commission and the European Union can honour their commitments. It was perhaps the Commission’s initial lack of interest in the negotiations that led to some of the criticisms in the report about the procedure that was followed, despite the fact that Mauritania continues to be one of the European Union’s major fishing partners and despite the fact that the financial contribution is still one of the largest and involves ever-greater commitments towards developing the Community fisheries sector. It is therefore difficult to understand why the text that has been negotiated entails a big reduction in the permissible catch of between 25% and 50% for almost all categories of fish and why, in addition to the technical measures, conditions have been accepted which for us are difficult to understand. As we have said on several occasions in this forum, and as Europêche said in a letter to you, Mr Borg, there is not much point in negotiating marvellous fishing opportunities – which is not the case in this Agreement – if we then accept technical conditions which prevent us being able to take proper advantage of those possibilities. The minimum size set for octopus bears no relation to the size set for adjacent areas; the additional two-month biological recovery period negotiated at the last minute, virtually unbeknown to the fisheries sector, was based on a poor quality scientific report and was introduced at the request of the Mauritanian party without the necessary prior consultation of the joint scientific committee; it is based solely on cephalopods, despite the fact that the recovery period affects all categories. All of this is a disturbing indication of how the European Commission sometimes negotiates. It is for this reason, Mr President, Mr Borg, that we must renew our insistence on greater involvement for the European Parliament, at least as an observer at the joint committee meetings, as a minimum institutional transparency requirement, which should have been met some time ago. It would not be a bad thing, given the new powers which we hope the European Parliament will acquire with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty – which was imminent and I am convinced must take place soon – for the Council and the Commission to prepare themselves for involving Parliament in a role which, sooner or later, it will be called upon to fulfil. We also hinted in the report that we were disappointed that the Commission, and here I am afraid that I have to disagree with you, Mr Borg, had failed to respect the relative stability of the Agreement, by giving itself powers to relax a criterion which on other occasions it has regarded as virtually sacrosanct, an action which we will keep a very close watch on, as our remit demands. I hope that in the case to which you referred, that of cephalopods, the allocation keys based on relative stability and on the historic fishing rights in this fishing ground will be respected. We will be very keen to know the outcome of the meetings which have been scheduled in various fora and joint committees to resolve some of the technical questions to which I referred in the report and which can, as is still the case in Morocco, tie up a fleet which desperately needs access to the fishing opportunities for which it is paying large amounts of money. Despite all this, with its duration increased to four years, as you said, this protocol continues, along with the Morocco protocol, to be the most important fisheries collaboration between the European Union and developing countries, and for this reason we obviously seek a vote against the two new amendments proposed and swift approval of the Commission proposal.
 Carmen Fraga Estévez,

 Mr President, I will try to be systematic. In the first place, with regard to the point made by Mrs Isler Béguin, I would point out that the funds for development cooperation increase over the four years that the protocol is in force. It is the total financial contribution which is being reduced by 19 %, but amounts allocated to development cooperation are increasing to EUR 11 million, EUR 16 million, EUR 18 million and EUR 20 million, so as far as development cooperation is concerned you need have no worries, because those amounts are actually being increased. Mr Borg, as regards the minimum size for octopus, and since the technical measures are important for take-up of fishing opportunities, I would say that this is not a problem which needs to be dealt with at this juncture. You know very well that the matter is still pending. I keep on saying this: the size is the highest in the whole region. The Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF) said at its meeting this year that a common minimum size should be set for the whole region and I think that here the Commission should make an effort to ensure that this matter ceases to be an issue. The report drawn up by the Mauritanian scientific committee states that in November, for example, 50% of the catch in the Mauritanian fishing ground can be octopus of between 300 and 500 grams, in other words there is a problem with minimum size in the Mauritanian fishing ground and elsewhere. With regard to relative stability, I am not going to get into an argument with you, but this is a topic which we have discussed in Parliament, one which is in the basic regulation which we have been discussing along with the regulation of licences for third countries, but the initial allocation is another matter. The initial allocation needs to respect historical rights and then if, under that allocation, fishing opportunities are not taken up, the Commission may, I agree, give them to whoever wants them and applies for them, but initially it is the historical rights which must be respected and, in the case of category five in Mauritania, this has not been the case, Mr Borg. I will not elaborate any further. I could answer more questions, but I think that, even though I cannot see very well without my glasses, I have run out of time.

Mr President, firstly, I agree with Mr Borg that it is a pity that we have had to work in this way, on the basis of unofficial documents which have not yet been translated into all the languages, when for some considerable time this Parliament has been requesting measures and sounding the alert about the serious crisis threatening the fishing industry. Obviously, Mr Borg, we too have accepted the urgency out of respect for our fisheries sector. Likewise, I would like to stress that this proposal is, as Mr Borg indicated, just one element of a package of measures and that we do not have a timetable or the salient details which would enable us to make an overall assessment of the new de minimis
 measures, the amendments to State aid, the guidelines for the new common organisation of the market, or the new ad hoc financial instrument, to which the Commission proposal refers. As regards the modification to the European Fisheries Fund proposed by the Commission, I appreciate the efforts at flexibility, although it would have been more practical to follow the European Parliament’s proposals at the time they were adopted, proposals which were more appropriate for times of crisis, such as changes to engines, and which might, perhaps, have been able to prevent this steep descent towards scrapping which now faces us. I am also very grateful, and I really mean this, for Mr Borg’s willingness this morning to include various amendments suggested in the Fisheries Committee, including my own proposal, and for accepting that the period of reference for accessing benefits under the Fleet Adaptation Scheme should include turnover for the first six months of 2008, which was the time of the highest fuel price rises, in addition to 2007. Lastly, we would like the Member States affected to make greater efforts to implement these measures, as well as the other measures. The ball really lies in their court; they need to act swiftly in order to ensure as far as possible that these measures, and those which are still pending, really help to alleviate the crisis in the fishing industry. I would not like what happened with the Regulation on illegal, undocumented and unregulated (IUU) fishing, where the Council decided that it would not enter into force until 2009, to happen here.

Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party propelled this debate in the belief that our institution could not continue to show indifference in the light of the gravity of the crisis. I think that we were right, given that only yesterday, and for the first time, the Commission announced a series of measures that this Parliament had been requesting for years, some of which are identical to those contained in the joint motion for a resolution. As indicated in the resolution, the price of fuel for fishermen has risen by more than 300% in the last five years and more than 38% since January, while prices have remained the same for 20 years, with decreases in some cases of up to 25% as a result of the massive entry of imports, which are often products of illegal fishing. My Group has emphasised that there is no sector that can survive these conditions and that is why it wanted to bring everyone together today, including the Council and the Commission, to find out more about this issue and debate the package of measures. We are particularly pleased that the measures at last include an increase in de minimis
 aid to EUR 100 000, although we would have preferred it to be allocated per vessel instead of per undertaking, as this Parliament has requested and as stipulated in the joint resolution. We fully support the reductions in social costs and the announcement of greater flexibility of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) so that all those who so desire can opt to restructure their undertakings, replace their engines with more efficient engines or receive additional aid, as you indicated, for temporary cessation. We nevertheless believe, Commissioner, that there is another set of measures that warranted the same emphasis and should have been developed in as much detail as those aimed at the restructuring of the sector: I am referring to market-based measures, such as the reform of the COM, which enable fishermen to play a greater role in the setting of prices, more specific measures concerning labelling and, above all, measures that demonstrate the clear will of the Council and the Commission to combat illegal fishing. We thus welcome some of the measures that are a step in the right direction, but we have to wonder whether we might have prevented the sector from reaching this critical situation by reacting much sooner.

Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon and events in Ireland are very important, but should not prejudice discussion of an issue like fishing. I have to say that many deputies are not very interested in fishing. However, if ever the fishing industry suffered a real crisis, it is the one it is going through right now. On 23 June, the European Union Council of Fisheries Ministers will take a series of decisions on the crisis in the fishing sector, which is conjunctural and structural. I think that the European Union fishing sector would not understand it if this Parliament did not take the time to examine this issue and take a position on it. I therefore ask the political groups to show some sensitivity and, once and for all, to contribute to a good debate on the crisis in the fishing sector.

First, I regret the unacceptable conduct of the Committee on Development, which is under the impression it is not subject to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament. It has circumvented the strengthened cooperation procedure set out in Rule 47 and corrected the Committee on Fisheries’ statements on issues that are strictly within the latter’s competence. It has also behaved in a completely untrustworthy way from the start of this report by obstinately trying to usurp the competence of the Committee on Fisheries on the issue of Fisheries Partnership Agreements. While the Committee on Fisheries has issued an opinion that consciously sought to be completely respectful to the sensibilities we know this issue awakens in the Committee on Development, the latter has, as it intended from the beginning, intervened in purely common fishing policy matters. Mr President, some committee chairmen have a tendency to think they can do no wrong and that the Rules of Procedure do not apply to them, although they should be their most prominent defenders. The result is sterile confrontation between committees that damages the credibility of the whole institution. I hope that this case serves to stifle these temptations to abuse power and that all those who are interested in learning about the role played by the Fisheries Partnership Agreements in the development of the villages and national fisheries of West Africa can make an analysis based on a comprehensive and uncensored report. By presenting this amendment on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, this rapporteur wants to show our willingness to get back on course, although we have announced that if the other political groups do not support the amendment, we will ask for the report to be returned to the competent committee for the fund.

 Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Aubert for her report. I think that it clearly expresses Parliament’s political will to support whatever actions are necessary to eradicate illegal fishing in all contexts, and, starting with the context that affects us, to close the Community to imports of and trade in illegal fisheries products. We cannot, however, get around the responsibility that falls to the port State and the Commission itself under this proposal. We are talking about a regulation that is very ambitious in its wording, which will compel the Member States to be extremely vigilant and not to spare any material or human resources – one of the weak points of the whole control policy – to turn words into deeds. Unfortunately, this means once again that we need to bring other political wills into play in addition to our own. The damage that illegal fishing causes, not only to biological resources, but also to legal fishermen, has been considerable every day for years. Currently a large proportion of the sector is in a state of revolt in response to another massive drop in profitability, one of the most serious causes of which is of course the rise in diesel prices. There are, however, other factors that are adding to the losses, and among these the mass entry of imports at low prices and of dubious origin across our borders is, under these circumstances, especially scandalous. By way of example: in the last five months of this year alone, in Spain the price of diesel has risen by 38%, while the price of swordfish, which is an imported species par excellence
, has dropped by 40%. There is no business in any sector that can survive this type of economic context, but nevertheless it is a proven fact that, when there has been the political will to monitor imports closely, as has occurred in the past – and I can bear witness to this – the prices paid to Community producers have immediately recovered. Commissioner, I therefore ask you and the Member States to be firm in implementing this regulation with the utmost possible urgency.

 Madam President, we are obviously all in favour of protecting vulnerable marine ecosystems from destructive fishing practices. In fact, I am so much in favour of it that I would even advocate protecting them against all destructive practices, including non-fishing practices. Ultimately, however, we already know that in these cases it is up to the fisheries sector to lead the way and set an example. As I have already said in relation to the report by Mrs Miguélez on deep-sea fish stocks, I think that our main concern should be to protect all vulnerable ecosystems that have been identified as such, wherever they are, not just those that are lucky enough to be below a depth of 1 000 metres. As Mr Freitas has already said, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has ruled out the depth criterion as being arbitrary and non-scientific, and the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), including the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO), have even ruled out the 2 000 metre rule, without even considering a 1 000 metre limit, as in their opinion the limit would serve no purpose, so they have removed it. However, my question, Commissioner, is as follows: you have said that this is going to be applied to the fleets that fish on the Patagonian shelf. Recently representatives of the Ocean Institute were here presenting assessment studies in which they did not detect any vulnerable marine ecosystems in that area. I would therefore like to ask you whether you are going to continue to insist on applying this proposal to the Community fleet that fishes in that area. Finally I would like to discuss the subject of observers, regarding which I think that the report by Mr Freitas has provided a considerable dose of reason. I think, and I am in agreement with the report, that it is important to have observers who are scientists, as they have to evaluate vulnerable marine ecosystems, which cannot be done by just any observer. As has been said by the scientists themselves, however, it seems absurd to have one per boat, because as well as emptying our oceanography institutes, there would be no point in having one per boat, as it is much more important to consider planned and organised sampling programmes that are maintained over time, which is what is going to give us a good monitoring overview of these fisheries. I would therefore be grateful, Commissioner, if you could answer my questions, and I call for support for the report by Mr Freitas.

Mr President, it is surprising that the response from the European Commission to the judgment of the Court of Justice was a new proposal amending the support scheme for cotton, which is practically identical to the previous one, except in relation to linking the support to the cotton harvested. Due to all this, we warmly welcome the excellent report drawn up by Mr Gklavakis, which has put the finger on the main problems affecting the production and processing sector. Firstly, the Commission’s proposal to maintain the 35% of coupled aid is, as has been demonstrated in recent years by the reduction in production in a country such as Spain, entirely inadequate; therefore, we think that the solution provided by the report to leave the maximum limit to subsidiarity is the most appropriate. Mr Gklavakis has given some figures, and I can tell you, Commissioner, that Andalusia, which is the main producing region in my country, has lost 65% of its production in the last three years. Also, contrary to what you said, Commissioner, and I am sorry to contradict you, I think that Amendment 17, which I tabled myself and which has been included in the report, is very positive, as it rightly states that aid to producers can be increased when the cultivated area is less than the size of the base area for production, which I do think will benefit the sector, maintaining financial neutrality, as well as resulting in full use of resources, and obviously giving great flexibility to the sector. Finally, Commissioner, I would like to point out, in relation to the ginning industry, that I believe was the great oversight in the 2004 reform and whose restructuring is an indisputable fact, that it is essential that a restructuring fund be created, which is mentioned in Mr Gklavakis’s report. In addition, I do think that Amendment 39, which we tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, would help, through Article 69, to provide greater funding for this processing industry. Finally, Mr President, I would like to express my rejection of the agreement reached this week by the Special Committee on Agriculture, because I think that it still does not provide an adequate response to the problems in the sector, and, above all, to the problems in the ginning industry; I must tell you that today I received a note from the Spanish ginning industry stating that if the Council does not amend this proposal, it will cause the 27 ginning factories to cease activity. I hope that the Council will change all these things and I thank the Commissioner for being here.

Mr President, I also think that there are ample reasons to support the amendments tabled for this report, and that the report is very valuable. With regard to the ban being discussed here on fishing at a depth of more than 1 000 metres, the Committee on Fisheries already made it very clear in another report that was much more directly connected with vulnerable marine ecosystems than this one is, in which linking depth to sensitive ecosystems was rejected by a large majority. Vulnerable habitats will have to be protected where they are found, irrespective of whether they are at a 1 000, 600 or 200 metres, and not based on whether they fall on one side or the other of an artificial line drawn in an office in Brussels. This is also the doctrine of the FAO, which in its preparatory work on the guidelines for the protection of vulnerable ecosystems ruled out using depth as a criterion, precisely because it considered it to be arbitrary, lacking in scientific basis and more fanciful than anything, because, as I have said, since it does not protect coral or seamounts that are at a lesser depth, it would immediately wipe off the map fisheries that have been operating for some time without any problems, such as, for example cutlassfish fisheries in the Azores or black halibut in the area regulated by the NAFO. These are just two examples. However, by supporting the amendments we would introduce greater consistency to legislative processes, as we are now in the process of preparing the future legislation on discards to be applied to all Community fleets. I therefore do not think that this is the time to jeopardise certain fleets with regulations on discards which could ultimately result in inconsistencies with the general rules, which goes against the practice of better regulation to the benefit of the public.

Mr President, as some of you will know from the media, a Spanish freezer vessel, the Playa de Bakio,
 based in Bermeo, carrying 26 crew aboard, 13 Spanish nationals and 13 crew of African origin, was seized yesterday when fishing for tuna in international waters 250 miles off the coast of Somalia. For some time now, the fisheries sector has been very concerned at the absence of security in that part of the Indian Ocean where piracy has become rife and where a French yacht was seized recently on 11 April. In view of this situation, Mr President, I would like to ask Parliament and the Community institutions as a whole to take whatever steps are necessary to expedite the immediate release of the crew and the vessel, and to protect the Community fleet fishing those waters, now considered to be the most dangerous in the world.

Madam President, in general terms, apart from some aspects on which the Committee on Fisheries, in agreement with the Council, has corrected the Commission in order to avoid excess discretion, we support the fundamental aspects of this proposal, the objective of which is for there to be a single framework for the Community system of authorisations for vessels operating outside Community waters. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is therefore going to vote against the amendments already rejected by the Committee on Fisheries that have been tabled again with 40 signatures, which go precisely in the opposite direction, in that they insist that agreements on exchanges of quotas should remain outside the general legislation on licences to fish. In my opinion, given that the Court of Auditors’ report on the shortcomings of the control policy is still making the headlines and it has been decided to tackle once and for all the fight against illegal fishing, it is not very acceptable to claim that some agreements should continue to be outside a general framework that is very necessary as a basic legal guarantee of equal and non-discriminatory treatment, both among operators and among Member States. It should also be pointed out that we are immersed in working on an integrated and coordinated focus for the different Community policies, in particular maritime policy, a focus that Parliament has fully supported, as well as the even more necessary process of simplifying Community legislation. In this respect, it should not be forgotten that we are talking about more than 9 000 vessels that operate under the different agreements and regional fisheries organisations, which means processing more than 16 000 fishing authorisations, as no agreement, in either the North or the South, is exempt from this obligation. If it is time for anything, then, it is time to harmonise and simplify a framework to make it as standardised as possible and not to continue creating differences that only make monitoring difficult and generate mistrust of the rules.
 Carmen Fraga Estévez,

Madam President, more than 10 years ago, Parliament considered the possibility of introducing fishing rights into the CFP, through an own-initiative report on the future review of the CFP. We can therefore only express our satisfaction at the Commission’s decision to finally examine the possibilities of this fisheries management tool, although in my opinion, in a too simplistic and superficial way, undoubtedly due to a fear of unleashing the fury of the Council regarding these matters. Those who are the most resistant to change and the least enterprising, both in the fisheries sector and in the Council, have always feared any change to management systems, even for the better. This does not mean that these sectors and Member States are in a better situation, or even in the same situation as they were 30 years ago, but rather they are dragging the more dynamic sectors towards a dead end. It is true that management through the allocation of fishing rights raises questions with regard to implementation, but it is just as true that countries in which fishing is an important sector for the future have been able to resolve them, demonstrating that, at least for parts of the fleet that are able to evolve towards more modern, efficient and sustainable approaches, it has advantages that are far from negligible. We therefore also welcome Mrs Attwooll’s report, which, alongside the concerns, has succeeded in reflecting the possible advantages, which could include improvements in control, a reduction in capacity, a decrease in discards and lower dependency on public aid. I would like to say to Mrs Attwooll that fishing is indeed an economic activity, and one that needs to be profitable, which is now ceasing to be the case, therefore perhaps we need more economists in fisheries than there are at present, to analyse these issues in more detail. Having said this, I wish the Commission great success in this debate and I hope that the management model, which has been a failure, can be changed in the future.

Mr President, as coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Fisheries I would like to make the following comments on the Common Fisheries Policy. Firstly, with regard to the Key Actions envisaged for 2009, and those under item 2 of the Annex on sustainable development, we can see that fisheries policy is incorporated into the integrated maritime policy, something that our Group does not agree with. While it is true that some aspects of the CFP are part of the maritime policy, so are some aspects of the transport policy, for example, but this does not mean that it is subsumed or hijacked under this heading. Secondly, with regard to the changes in the allocation of financial resources and, in particular, with regard to heading 2, ‘Preservation and management of natural resources’, we do not agree that the EUR 6 million required to fund the preparatory action for the maritime policy should have to come from the already small budget for the CFP, especially given that at this point in the budgetary year there is no way of knowing what volume of outstanding appropriations could be made available for other uses.

Mr President, I would like to start by first of all congratulating Mr Goepel on his work and saying that I am going to concentrate on talking about the future of the dairy sector. I would like to make the following comments. First of all I would like to say that there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding what the impact could be of eliminating the quota system in the various producing regions. Many people fear that the trend of abandoning production will accelerate and that it will be an irreversible blow to some areas with a very low level of profitability and few alternatives for agriculture. It is clear, however, that the current system of quotas is not having the desired result, which is achieving a balance between production and consumption. We have gone from having milk lakes to having a deficit of more than 3 million tonnes, which is strong evidence of the ups and downs of this COM, the uneven distribution of production quotas, poor and meagre evaluation of the latest reforms and of some of the specific measures applied, such as decoupling aid, the impact of which on the future of the sector we do not know. In addition to all of this there are the disparities that exist in the application of the quota system between some countries and others; and, Commissioner, I have to say that in some countries, such as mine, there are obstacles to the liberalisation of the sector, and that for example the individual transfer of quotas, a fundamental element for restructuring, has been banned since 2005. Finally, Commissioner, I would simply like to say that I think it would be positive to combine the idea of increasing quotas by 2% on a voluntary basis for 2008-2009, as proposed by the Jeggle and Goepel reports, with a non-linear increase for subsequent years, as requested in paragraph 84 of the Goepel report, in order to distribute the production quotas in a more balanced way, giving priority to Member States that have traditionally been in deficit in relation to their internal consumption.

 Madam President, in general terms I support the rapporteur’s report as an expression of the long-standing concern about the rigidity of the common fisheries policy when it comes to tackling problems which are entrenched in our fisheries management system, of which discards are simply another example. In particular I support the paragraphs advocating a fishery-by-fishery introduction of reductions in unwanted catches and discards, and their gradual elimination, and for any ban to be introduced only when it has been ascertained that there is no alternative, as the Council and all the regional consultative committees have said. We could not adopt another approach and we could not move to a full blanket ban on discards within a management system which encourages them, both through the rigid TAC system and quotas in force, and through the absence of adequate technical measures which constitute a fundamental factor in preventing by-catches, the review of which we have been waiting for years so that they can be adjusted for the Atlantic. What I cannot accept, Madam President, is Amendment 10, which would allow the creation of a parallel fishery market based on discarded fish, which would therefore be unlawful. I think we should remain firm in defending the principle of non-commercialisation of discards as set out in paragraph 32 of the report, as have countries with a longer history in this matter such as Norway. Incentives to prevent discards must be of a different kind: for example, incentives aimed at reducing them to a minimum through the use of more selective gear. It is much better for a juvenile fish to continue to live in the sea and grow up to feed people or other fish instead of being discarded and the subject of negotiations on fishmeal production.

Mr President, although I share the view that this recovery plan is not as ambitious as it should be, the truth is that it is the result of a hard-won compromise at the ICCAT and I believe that by approving it we are taking a huge step forward and for the first time sending a very clear message to the persons responsible for the over-fishing of this species. In any event, as far as the European Union is concerned, the serious status of the bluefin tuna is down to certain Member States which have allowed and even encouraged excessive growth of their Mediterranean fleets and by the Commission which, while fully aware of that abuse and the continuous under-reporting of catches, has not lifted a finger to remedy the situation until now. This failure to take responsibility is what has led to the closure of the fishery to all Member States because of the scandalous news in August that two countries had fished the European Union’s entire quota. On that ground I believe it is important for the plenary sitting to endorse Mr Braghetto’s report, which includes my amendment, so that henceforth the Member States will be required to submit a fisheries plan in advance stating, first, the maximum number of vessels and secondly, that the country’s fishing effort is in line with its quota. The Commission has indicated that it is in favour of incorporating the fisheries plan and we hope that the Council will also lend it its support. I regret, nonetheless, that the report has not made provision for any exceptions for fleets which have since time immemorial fished the Atlantic taking a negligible amount of the Community quota with much more selective gear. The people involved in these traditional fisheries are therefore forced to pay for the sins of unrestricted avarice on the part of the purse-seine fleets of the two Member States I referred to above even though they have had no part in it. This is an injustice which I also hope this Parliament and the Council will rectify. Finally, all that remains for me to do is to ask and urge the Commission to take all the measures necessary so that when distributing the Community quota for next year due compensation is made to the Member States which have been forced to stop fishing because the quotas to which they were entitled have been used up by others and that the appropriate tonnage is withdrawn from the quotas of those responsible so that it can serve as genuine and effective recompense.

Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, in relation to the Commission’s common fisheries policy proposals we again face a number of issues the Commission has not followed up as rapidly as it should have. Suffice to say we are some years behind in securing a new regulation on technical measures in the Atlantic: this is a fundamental aspect for fisheries management that we hoped to secure by 2008, since it would be the best possible contribution by CFP to the goal of simpler legislation. We would also like the Commission to make a start on issuing precise guidelines as to how it intends to apply the maximum sustainable yield model to EU fisheries, particularly multi-species fisheries. We feel it is important for specific legislative proposals to be put forward for eco-labelling of fisheries products since this will have significantly improve the traceability of these products and provide guarantees to prevent the consumption and sale of products obtained from illegal fishing. Finally, following the Commission’s announcement that it intends to withdraw the draft agreement with Tanzania, I must pass on the request from the sector that it do all it can to continue negotiations with this country: they are vital to provide the tuna fleet with fishing grounds in this area of Africa through a number of agreements with adjoining exclusive economic zones.

Madam President, thank you very much to the Commissioner for being here. I think that the Commissioner, the rapporteur and many of the speakers have highlighted the problems that there have been with implementing the 2005 sugar reform, and the fact that abandonment of production has suffered delays leaving it far short of the objective of 6 million tonnes provided for in the reform. I therefore believe that we all welcome the proposal that the Commission is now putting forward, which will give a new impetus to abandonment. The sector, too, mainly the beet production sector, is very pleased that the restructuring process is being speeded up given that, as the Commissioner also said, otherwise there will be an across-the-board cut in quotas in 2010, with no aid funds to compensate for those cuts. I think that the amendment I tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in line with this philosophy and this new proposal. I am referring to Amendment 31, which calls for a report evaluating the reform and, if necessary, proposals to extend this aid fund by one year during the 2010-2011 marketing year. It was initially planned for a period of four years, to compensate, as I said, for this initial delay in implementing the reform. This is something that has been called for by producers, and I think that it should be supported, especially given that the fund is financed solely by the sector, and therefore has no financial impact on the Community budget. I ask, Commissioner, for this amendment to be approved by the Commission, and of course also my fellow Members. Finally, I would just like to thank Mrs Batzelli for her work, her reports, and the improvements she has proposed, with the support of the entire Committee on Agriculture, and for the proposal presented by the Commission.

Madam President, allow me to say, first of all, that today a Spanish fishing boat sank off the Andalusian coast and as a result three people died and five are currently missing. I ask Parliament to stand with the families in their sorrow and the desire for the missing sailors to be rescued. I will now move on to the report that we are discussing today. The first thing that I would like to point out, as the Commission itself recognises and Parliament has stated on numerous occasions, is the clear failure of the Community fisheries management system, which over the many years it has been in existence has not ensured the sustainability of resources, and has done even less to support an efficient and profitable fisheries sector. Paradoxically, the management system is the only one that was not a fundamental part of the major reforms of 2002 and, because of this, the Commission has to paper over the cracks here and there, dealing with unsustainable discards, inventing control measures day after day and establishing recovery plans, but without tackling the substantive issue: establishing a coherent and up to date framework for the fisheries management model. This is the context in which we have received the Commission communication, which opts for maximum sustainable yield as the yardstick for long-term fishing activities, a theoretical model that seeks to combine the most efficient exploitation of a species with guaranteeing biological sustainability. The problem is that maximum sustainable yield, which, as an intellectual and theoretical concept may be irreproachable, has been found to have more than a few contradictions in its practical application, and, in fact, a large proportion of the scientific community now considers it to have been largely superseded. The issue is therefore one of redefining the model in such a way that it can be adapted to the reality of fishing communities, This is where a series of questions arise as to how to do this, which the report that we are presenting today has sought to highlight, and which are not in any way answered in the Commission communication, which is very ambiguous and vague. It is clear that here we are not criticising the Commission’s intention to impose a new management model, but its inability to explain to us how it is going to overcome the difficulties of putting it into practice and avoid the pitfalls that exist in the actual formulation of maximum sustainable yield. Among these, we know that maximum sustainable yield requires long series of reliable, accurate scientific data, while for the vast majority of species, it is not possible to have this degree of certainty. Secondly, the model was created based on the exploitation of a single population, while the large majority of Community fisheries are multi-species, which means over- or under-fishing many of them, which is obviously contrary to the actual definition of maximum sustainable yield. It also does not work for pelagic species, and we also now know that other factors influence the status of populations, such as errors in recruitment or environmental factors, which may result in incorrect definitions of maximum sustainable yield. What is certain is that strict application of maximum sustainable yield will, in the short term, result in a sometimes drastic reduction in fishing opportunities, and therefore in the activity, income and employment of the Community fleet. Madam President, allow me to thank all my colleagues for their contributions and to request the adoption of a report by means of which the Committee on Fisheries wishes to call on the European Commission first to clear up all these uncertainties before forcing the introduction of a type of model for some species of great economic importance whose effectiveness is, for many fisheries, scientifically and economically questionable. The committee also wishes to call on the Commission to first seriously look at a clear fisheries management system, with an eco-system-based focus, and then to decide on how to adapt the reference points and the chosen model, whether this is based on MSY or something else. This should not be done - and I must stress this point - without first carrying out a social and economic analysis of the repercussions of implementing it and measures to counter its impact. All these questions are currently of great concern to our sectors and to us.

 Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her reports which have gone into the Commission proposals in detail and improved them, and I only hope that the technical agreement reached in the special agriculture committee does not prevent the Council from considering the amendments adopted by Parliament, such as the amendment on the non-abolition of aid to private storage. Furthermore I would like to stress that this package of proposals contains significant elements which herald the start of an intermediate stage leading to the abolition, in principle by the year 2015, of the quota system. I refer by way of illustration to decreasing the intervention price for skimmed milk powder. The announcement that milk quotas are to disappear has by itself created a situation of uncertainty among producers, as the Commissioner is well aware, and the quota market has been crippled as a result, making for a significant slowdown in the restructuring required in the sector, at least in Spain. On those grounds we are asking the Commission not to delay in presenting proposals on the future of the sector which reply to questions such as the rate of gradual increase in quotas or possible compensation for loss of production rights, or the level of direct aid following the new fall in intervention prices; these questions among others require an urgent response so that the sector can be brought out of this uncertain situation.

Mr President, it is a great pleasure finally to be able to debate a fisheries agreement with Greenland that begins to respect the minimum rules of financial transparency and non-discrimination between shipowners and Member States. We must acknowledge the progress made since previous agreements, including the mid-term modification of 2003, to bring them into line – as the Commissioner has said quite rightly – with the guidelines of the Council of Ministers and the demands of the Court of Auditors and of this Parliament, which focussed essentially on that lack of budgetary transparency, the worst example of which was the institutionalised custom of paying astronomical sums for ‘non-existent fisheries’ or paper quotas. In any event, this Agreement still has too much small print and its content is still too different from other agreements. So that we do not have to relive past situations, therefore, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he can commit himself to guaranteeing that we will never again have to hear about paper quotas or see grotesque situations such as that of the fishing of queen crabs – whose quotas, which had been repeatedly requested by Community shipowners, were returned in the end to Greenland unused and having cost a fortune – and whether fishing opportunities not used by the Member States to which they are allocated will be able to be used by those who request them, as happens in the case of the other agreements. Having said that, Mr President, it only remains for me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Post, who has had the difficult job of continuing with a report that was begun by another Member, Mr Maat, and who has done a tremendous job. Mr President, since I have a few seconds left, I would like once again to protest about the fact that, in this House, fisheries reports are always debated at the end of a night sitting. I would ask you, as a Vice-President and a Spaniard, to try to do something to ensure that this does not happen again in the future.

Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Aubert for her report, which reminds us of the problem of piracy at sea and the poor record in terms of what has been done to combat it. I would also like to thank her for supporting the amendments that I believe have clarified her report, establishing the boundaries between unrecorded and unregulated illegal fishing and violations of the common agricultural policy in Community waters. This is an important aspect because, although we need to put an end to both, completely different weapons are required for each. One of the most important weapons is action by regional fisheries organisations, which are perhaps currently the only possible defence against illegal actions at sea in a battle which is, by definition, international and multilateral, and whose role has also been re-assessed as a result of the amendments presented. At a time of such concern about the sustainability of the marine environment and when our own fishermen are gradually being denied access to resources, it is extremely worrying that we are even having to witness certain Member States taking steps backwards, including one that I know well. And it is depressing that, last Tuesday, the Director for External Policies of the Directorate-General for Fisheries should have had to admit that the European Union had failed to slow down illegal fisheries. And all at a time like this. It was in Galicia last week that the fishing authorities of eighteen Member States began to debate the package of measures to combat illegal fishing, which will apparently not be presented to us before the middle of the year, according to the Commissioner. With regard to this issue, the ball is more than ever in the Council’s court, because, without genuine political will on the part of the Member States, without their firm commitment to harmonising actions, making them obligatory and making them a priority, things will carry on the same next year and the year after. I hope that that does not happen and that we will have an effective policy soon. Thank you very much, Mr President, and allow me to protest once again about the fact that a fisheries debate is taking place at night and that even a new report being newly included on the agenda is being put before it. I would like to make a serious protest on behalf of my group and on my own behalf about the way fisheries is treated in this Parliament.

Madam President, Commissioner, the lack of an agreed compromise before this report was adopted has led to a series of errors and contradictions which I hope will be resolved in the vote in this plenary. Of these errors, I would like to point to the one contained in paragraph 18, relating to the distillation of by-products, which requests that the alcohol obtained by means of this kind of distillation be directed, at least in part, to the potable alcohol market. This demonstrates a lack of knowledge of the different kinds of distillation and of alcohols produced by them, since potable alcohol, intended exclusively for the production of brandies, ports and liqueurs, is a high-quality product, something that can in no way be achieved by means of alcohol from the distillation of by-products. For all of these reasons, I believe that we must vote against this paragraph in order to prevent any more confusion in relation to types of distillation and the alcohols produced by them. Secondly, I would like to stress something that is crucial to any COM reform: the budgetary aspects. To date, all COM reforms have employed a distribution of funds based on an historical criterion. Surprisingly, in the case of the wine reform, the intention is to change to other formulae, which are not yet very clear, but which are creating great uncertainty in the sector. In order to provide Mrs Batzeli’s report with more clarity, therefore, I also propose that we vote for the amendments on employing the historical criterion for the distribution of the funds.

Mr President, I wish to protest once again at the fact that fisheries is always dealt with in a secretive nocturnal manner; that is what is happening today once again. I would like to thank Mr Arnaoutakis for his wonderful report. Since it is so late, I shall be concise and stress three aspects relating to Gabon and fisheries agreements in general that I believe to be important. I must once again point to the Commission’s delay in presenting this issue to the European Parliament and point out that the European Union is going to be paying the first portion of the financial payments to Gabon at least six months late. This is unacceptable and the European Union must not cause this kind of delay, especially when it comes to third countries whose economies are so weak. I believe that we have reached an agreement with Commissioner Borg and I hope that there will be no more such delays in future. Secondly, I would also like to stress the financial aspects of fisheries agreements in general, this specific case being one very infamous example. There are many people here ― and I regret that they are not actually the people who are most critical of the fisheries agreements ― who complain that the fisheries sector does not cooperate in, or hardly contribute to, the funding of these agreements. In fact, in this case, in the Gabon agreement, the fisheries sector is going to pay almost 20% more than the European Union pays from the Community budget. That should reassure those who say that the fisheries sector does not contribute to the funding of the agreements. Finally, Mr President, I would also like to put a request to the Commission relating to the agreements that we in the Committee on Fisheries have been making repeatedly: that, in the name of greater transparency, Members of this Parliament should be able to participate as observers in the joint committees that control the implementation of fisheries agreements. We have already achieved that for the regional fisheries organisations and it would be good if we could take part in the joint committees in the future. We put this request the other day to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and I hope that Commissioner Figel' will communicate this request to the European Commission, so that, amongst the three institutions, we can obtain greater participation by Members of this Parliament. If only because of the time of night we have to work, I believe that we deserve to be in those committees as observers.

Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to congratulate Mr Fruteau on the excellent work he has done in drawing up this report and for his willingness to reach a consensus. I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her proposed reform, which has been accepted in general terms both by the sector and by this Parliament. I hope that, from now on, these new rules will put an end once and for all to the arguments within the World Trade Organisation, and I would therefore ask that, despite the new pressure from certain Latin American countries, the tariff of EUR 176 per tonne, which entered into force on 1 January following the agreement reached in Hong Kong, be defended and maintained as a minimum with a view to providing the European banana sector with a little stability. Commissioner, the outermost regions, which are the European Union’s main producers of bananas, are highly dependent on this product and therefore any modification to the arrangements governing the sector, in particular to the external arrangements, must be taken into account. I am therefore amazed by the debate that is taking place within the Council of Ministers on the period of reference proposed, which has led to a budget of EUR 280 million per year. I must insist that that period of reference must be the same as the one applied to the other COM reforms, and it would therefore be incomprehensible for there to be an exception to the rule set so far, or a budgetary haggle, when 98% of that sum is quite rightly intended for the outermost regions. Since it is important, I would also like to mention another of the requests included in the report: that relating to the continuity of the system for producers’ organisations, with a view to maintaining the concentration of the Community produce, which has been one of the main successes of the COM in bananas. Its disappearance, Commissioner, would only exacerbate the disadvantages faced by Community producers in the face of third-country imports.

Madam President, I wished to stress how strange it is that there are no concrete legislative proposals for a common policy such as the Common Fisheries Policy. The fact that the Commission’s document takes a very horizontal view of the priorities cannot be used as an excuse for the lack of commitment to a policy which furthermore is at a crucial moment both internally and internationally. Fishing management is going to be affected – it already is – by a whole series of measures, programmes and policies that respond to the Union’s very diverse commitments within the framework of the Law of the Sea, the Johannesburg Summit, sustainable development, environmental strategies, climate change and biodiversity, amongst other things. Within this context, the Commission’s general attitude to the fisheries policy is marked by a surprising lack of legislative activity, a lack of political impulse and lack of ambitions and commitments in the face of these challenges. Legislative activity in the field of fisheries is increasingly focussed on routine matters and minor day-to-day modifications, and on the rare occasion when the big outstanding issues are dealt with, they are dealt with by means of mere communications with no legislative weight, as in the case of discarded catches, or which come extremely late, as in the case of eco-labelling, or which are at risk of fading to nothing, like the proposal on the Mediterranean. This gives the impression that, faced with the challenges I have mentioned, the fisheries policy has chosen to remain at the lowest possible level and allow itself to be led by the priorities of other policies, ignoring the fact that fisheries has a lot to say. Madam President, in order to deal specifically with certain matters which remain outstanding and which are extremely urgent, we would call upon the Commission to make immediate rigorous and coordinated legislative proposals on undeclared and unregulated illegal fishing.

Mr President, Commissioner, as a representative of Galicia, a milk-producing region par excellence
, I think that this oral question put to the European Commission today is very opportune. Commissioner, producers are quite disconcerted by information that has been circulated, from which it can be deduced that there will be changes to the system established in 2003 for the milk sector and specifically concerning the quota system. You were not very specific today, Commissioner, but I think that you made a series of things clear: that you are going to launch a debate, that there is going to be a transition period prior to the removal of quotas in 2015, from which I deduce that there is going to be a phasing out period prior to 2015 when quotas are permanently removed. Commissioner, we are talking about an economic sector that needs legal security and medium- and long-term guarantees that will enable a minimum degree of planning, and any further change or uncertainty could, at least in my country, have serious social and economic consequences. Quotas are a very important asset to farmers. In a region like Galicia, in which there is a need to continue with the restructuring process, it is essential, in order to complete it, that the current quota system is maintained as planned. If not, the consequences could be catastrophic, as removing quotas would have drastic repercussions for the price of milk, and consequently for profits in the dairy sector. I therefore ask, Commissioner, that any transitions be made and ideas proposed from 2015 onwards. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the fact that the policies of the Member States need to cooperate in the whole of this process and that therefore any restriction on exchanges of quotas in a Member State should be considered as a serious obstacle to the capitalisation, competitiveness and development of the sector, as is unfortunately the case with the national plan proposed by the Spanish Government.

Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being here. Like all of my fellow Members, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on this timely report, since, as previous speakers have said, there is no denying the serious economic situation being experienced by the fisheries sector, which has mainly been damaged over the last two years by the rising prices of fuel. Precisely when we need to tackle this situation, however, the lack of commitment and support contained in the Commission’s Communication is regrettable, since it only provides for measures offering a long-term solution and, even then, they are the most painful solutions for the sector, such as restructuring of the fleet. Given the current situation, however, we also need short-term solutions, and the Commission has ignored these completely. Not only is the minimal aid announced ridiculous compared to that offered to other production sectors, but also the Commission is still failing to fulfil its promise to publish the regulation authorising it and which we have been waiting for for more than two years. This is inexplicable given that, furthermore, this type of aid is exclusively national and does not therefore imply any additional cost to the Union’s budget. As Mr Guerreiro has said, we have just returned from a visit to the Algarve and, a few months before that, we were in Greece. We are all aware of the fisheries situation in our own countries, and I therefore believe that this document offers the minimum support we politicians must provide for the fisheries sector at this time. I too would therefore urge that it be approved tomorrow in plenary.

Mr President, I am surprised by Commissioner Borg’s statement that legislation that is recent cannot be modified. I believe that legislation that is not good must be updated. That is precisely what the 2005 Report of the ICCAT says about ratios for sharks. According to that report, the ratio applied to Prionacea glauca is wrong. Furthermore, the scientists of the ICCAT argue that it should be corrected. There are two reasons for this: the first is that data on landings based on an incorrect coefficient may lead them to make the wrong estimates; and, secondly, that the inconsistency in the ratio hinders the work of controlling the fleet, since, because it is impossible to comply with the rule, the control makes no sense. Commissioner, this is demonstrated in the report that you have sent to this Parliament. Commissioner, Mr President, I wish to ask that we update and correct the legislation once and for all, because otherwise we are creating a serious lack of confidence in the sector as a result of having rules with which, as I say, it is impossible to comply. I would also like one of the people who have spoken here, claiming that there are scientific reports, to tell me of at least one, supported by the international scientific community, that contradicts what the ICCAT said at the last plenary meeting of the Regional Fisheries Organisation that regulates all of these very species. I would ask that we act rationally, that we do things properly, that the coefficients be reviewed and that we choose those that can be fulfilled by the fleet. I must also say that the problem of over-fishing will not be resolved by means of ratios. It will be resolved by means of quotas for sharks.

Mr President, as rapporteur for this report, the first thing I would like to stress is the unquestionable role that a credible label or certification can play, among other measures that can be taken, in our efforts to guarantee sustainable fishing. Nevertheless, the issue has been on the table in the European Commission since the 1990s and so far nobody has decided to deal with it. In the meantime, in a market that is becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, private promoters of eco-labels for fishery products are feathering their nests, causing complete confusion amongst consumers, at best, and more than likely discrediting the system in general, since when a premium can be added to a product by saying that it is ecological, without the need to prove it, then fraud is a likely outcome. I am one of the people who have often reminded the Commission that it should deal with this issue as soon as possible. Hence the disappointment that some of us felt when the Commission finally published this communication: a document almost without content, lacking in analysis, which makes no commitment whatsoever and which does not provide any criteria or guidelines to follow. It clearly did not require more than ten years to achieve this result and the Commission is clearly totally overwhelmed by the reality of the attractive market in eco-labelling and the many private interests that sustain it, some of which are laudable and some of which are not. In that regard, I would like to mention that, when he appeared before the Committee on Fisheries on leaving office, the former Commissioner Mr Fischler confessed that something he had been unable to tackle by the end of his term-in-office had been rules on eco-labelling and that that – and I quote – was ‘due to pressure from many quarters’. To this we can add the fact that reliably establishing the criteria for defining a sustainable fisheries product is undoubtedly a much more complex task than it may at first appear. We must get to work though, because other interested parties are doing it for us and many of them only have their own interests in mind. The Commission is not alone in this task either, because it already has the guidelines issued by the FAO, and debates in many international fora, including the World Trade Organisation. Governments, NGOs, private companies and fishermen have also expressed their opinions. By means of this report, with the invaluable and varied contributions of many colleagues, including those of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the European Parliament is also offering its contribution to the definition of guidelines that will enable consumers, politicians and the fisheries sector to become more involved in the sustainability of fisheries resources. We believe that, in a global sense, a Community system of labelling must be consistent with the existing guidelines of international bodies, that it must not lead to any kind of discrimination, nor create obstacles to trade, particularly that of the least-developed countries, and that it must act as a weapon for combating illegal fishing by denying it access to the markets. With regard to its internal functioning, the Committee on Fisheries believes that, regardless of whether there are one or several labels, always of a voluntary nature, the system must be a single system and must be promoted by the European Union, which must establish its operating rules and guarantee the independence of the accreditation and certification bodies, as well as the transparency and accuracy of the information at all stages in the chain of custody, from the fishing vessel to the final consumer. We also call upon the Commission to present, within six months, a communication on the minimum requirements and guidelines for a Community scheme for labelling fisheries products. I would also like the Commission, finally, to clarify whether it is in favour of calling it an eco-label, or whether it is opting for another name and why, and we would urge it to take account of the considerations addressed to it by this House.

Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on behalf of my group on his magnificent report, which could not have been produced if he had not been generous enough to accept many amendments and suggestions from other Members representing different fishing regions with very different views of small-scale fishing. We must not forget that these vessels represent around 80% of all Community vessels and this kind of fishing is practiced in all of the coastal Member States, although in each one it has special characteristics. It is precisely the treatment of this aspect, which seems to me to be one of the greatest achievements of the report, since it has stipulated a series of criteria, which can indeed be common to the majority of the small-scale fleet, which in some Member States is defined by length, in others by the type of processing of the fisheries product, by distance from the coast or by the duration of tides, or by a combination of several criteria. The definition of small-scale fishing on the basis of the twelve-metre length, as in the case of Community legislation, therefore, is not in line with reality, and we hope that the Community legislation will be amended in this regard in the near future. It is also appropriate to stress this fleet’s responsibilities and obligations in terms of the conservation of stocks, since, although they are small or medium-sized vessels, we must not forget that there are very large numbers of them and they fish in waters that are very vulnerable to over-fishing, since these areas are characterised by a high concentration of young. I would finally like to point out that a high proportion of the fleet still has to deal with the issue of safety. I would therefore like to insist once again that the future European Fisheries Fund must take account of the modernisation and renewal needs in terms of safety and also in terms of energy saving, with a view to alleviating the crisis faced by the fisheries sector as a result of the rise in oil prices. I do not believe that the agreement adopted in Coreper and which is going to be presented to the Council of Ministers offers all of the measures that this Parliament called for in the Casa report on the European Fisheries Fund (EFP), in which there were many more measures which would undoubtedly make the renewal and modernisation of small-scale fisheries much more flexible.

Mr President, for the common fisheries policy, the Seventh Framework Programme is not just disappointing, but it should be openly described as hypocritical. We must not forget that one of the Union’s great objectives is to lead a policy of economic efficiency and competitiveness within a framework of sustainable development. When we talk about sustainable development, it immediately brings to mind the marine environment and hence the consequences of fishing activity. Any fisheries management regulation must end with the usual proviso that decisions will be taken in accordance with the best available scientific advice. When Commissioner Borg presented the Green Paper on the European Union’s future maritime policy last week, he once again emphasised the essential need to know how the oceans work and he insisted that new fisheries management measures cannot be implemented without knowing how ecosystems work and how different economic activities affect them. Nevertheless, we have moved on from specific chapters for fisheries research, provided with EUR 150 million in the Fifth Framework Programme, to EUR 60 million in the Sixth Programme, where for the first time the focus on the issue of fisheries disappears. Those engaged in fishing activity need to know the size of populations of species and the way in which they are developing, to investigate new, more selective fishing techniques and to look into cultivating new species in order to respond to the rapidly increasing internal consumption of fish and tackle the dependency on imports. Without this kind of specific research, any regulation applied to fishermen will lack solid scientific bases and will have no credibility. We will not become a leader in the field of sustainable development policies by taking this kind of step backwards. We would therefore call upon everybody – the rapporteur in particular – to support the amendments that several political groups and several Members have presented and that provide for this focus on fisheries.

Mr President, I am pleased that the Commissioner has taken good note both of this Parliament’s report on the recovery of European eel stocks and of the rapporteur, Mr Maat’s, working methods. The rigidity of the Commission’s proposal, its obfuscation in ignoring the biological behaviour of eels, whose capture is closely linked to lunar phases, and the injustice of seeing fishing as the only cause of the reduction in the eel population, have been replaced by a compromise by the rapporteur. We must thank him for his flexibility and his sensitivity in listening to the different fleets fishing eel during all of the phases of their lives and in habitats and river basins that vary enormously throughout Europe. The Commission’s proposal was rejected by the sector in all of the countries of the Union, by national administrations and by this Parliament. Mr Maat’s report has been approved unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries and has restored calm. The Commission must therefore take good note. We are aware of the urgent need to recover eel stocks and the proposal is therefore to reduce the fishing effort by half. Nevertheless, a reasonable way to do so is being proposed, replacing the Commission’s absurd proposal that fishing be halted from the first to the fifteenth day of each month. The obligation for future national plans to guarantee a 40% escape rate for eels, something that is practically impossible to calculate, is also removed and replaced by measures that guarantee a high escape rate for adult eel and, to this end, it is requested that account be taken not just of fishing, but of all human activities along rivers that hinder or prevent the return of eel to the sea. In conclusion, the report by Mr Maat and the Committee on Fisheries is a balanced and measured consensus report and, in line with what the Commissioner has said, I hope that both he and the Council will take good note of it.

Mr President, we are naturally pleased to have a new fisheries agreement with Morocco although, as the rapporteur has said, we do not yet know precisely what form it will take. We do know, however, that, after six years without an agreement, during which contacts have been constant, in the end, the two fleets that made fisheries relations with Morocco so very important have been left out: the cephalopod fleet and the crustacean fleet. That is one of the reasons why our feelings about the new agreement are bitter-sweet. Unfortunately there are other problems, however. We regret the pressure that has been put on us by the other institutions, even to violate the established procedures. This pressure has complicated the work of our Committee and the rapporteur very much, when our only intention is to ensure that this new agreement does not cause as many problems as the last one, and to obtain legal guarantees that the content sent to Parliament truly corresponds to what our fleet is going to face. We regret that doubts remain about this, since what the Commission considers to be technical negotiating errors of minor importance may mean, for example, that the seiner fleet cannot fish. Furthermore, the possibility of modifying the technical datasheets remains too open and we would therefore ask that all possible information be communicated and that Members of this Parliament be able to attend the joint committees as observers. Finally, we must thank the rapporteur for the balance he has achieved in relation to the political issues that have arisen. Like him, we believe that the Committee on Fisheries is not the place to resolve extremely important and complex international political problems. His report is scrupulous in terms of international law and, as has been said, it is in line with the legal reports of the Community institutions, and we would therefore ask once again for the new amendments presented to be rejected and instead we would ask all of the groups to support the report by the rapporteur. I would like finally to ask the Commissioner what stage the approval of this proposal by the Moroccan Parliament is at. According to what we have been told, that Parliament was going to meet on 15 April with this as one of its first subjects for debate. We would like to know whether it is in the process of being approved by the Moroccan Parliament.

Mr President, as rapporteur for the Committee on Fisheries, I am perfectly aware of the difficulties relating to this proposal. Parliament has played an effective and fundamental role in unblocking it following its presentation just over two and a half years ago, even finding a procedure which has made it possible to reach a compromise between the Commission and Parliament to overcome the difficulties of the proposal and which, furthermore, has had the support of the majority of the sector and of the national administrations. When there is so much consensus, it is incomprehensible that the Council, since April of last year, has been delaying the approval of what is probably currently the package of technical measures that most urgently needs to be adopted. This irresponsibility has many consequences: the Mediterranean is the only Community area which is still far from meeting the minimum requirements of responsible fishing and sustainable development, while in other Community waters much more drastic action is being taken in that regard. It is shameful that the huge majority of the Mediterranean fishermen themselves have understood better than the Council the urgent need to regulate these fishing grounds, despite the price that they will have to pay. The Council’s credibility is therefore being called very much into question. We also run the risk of failing to comply with our international obligations within the two regional fisheries organisations operating in the Mediterranean. Mr President, how can we have the nerve to propose more restrictive management measures to third countries again, when we ourselves are not capable of implementing them in our own territory? Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as well as telling us about the timetable in response to the question you have not yet answered, I would therefore ask you to explain to this Parliament why, when there is no blocking minority, the Council is incapable of taking a decision in this regard.

Mr President, as a representative in this Parliament of a European region in which the presence of women in the fishing sector is extremely high, including in the extractive sector, through activities such as shellfish gathering, I would like to thank Mrs Attwooll for her report, which stresses an extraordinary formula that will re-evaluate the role played by women in society and allow them to take more advantage of the different possibilities that are opening up to improve their training, their degree of specialisation and their future prospects. I am proud to be able to say that, over recent years, the fisheries authorities in my region have paid particular attention to the role of women, promoting ― and indeed calling urgently for ― the creation of associations and unreservedly supporting the integration of those associations into the existing networks, and arranging international forums and conferences to strengthen them and create new ones, with a view to the exchange of knowledge and experience amongst women from all parts of Europe. The results are spectacular, particularly with regard to making women themselves more aware of the economic and social importance of their work, moving on from seeing their role as one of supporting the family economy, which had traditionally fallen to them, to demanding the compensation to which they have a right as workers: better salaries, social benefits and training. The report by Mrs Attwooll accurately illustrates the role that they have played and the role that women’s networks may yet play in this field and calls upon national administrations and the Commission to continue providing and intensifying their support. For all of these reasons, our political group supports the fundamental points of this report and hopes that the plenary of this Parliament will support it as well.

Mr President, although this is a premature discussion, since the financial perspective has not yet been approved, I believe that we should approve Mrs Stihler’s report as an anticipatory measure, but I would like to make several comments, some of which coincide with those of the Commissioner. Firstly, we do not agree with the rapporteur’s statement that, in the event of a reduction of the appropriations laid down in the Commission’s proposal, they should be taken without any justification whatsoever from the heading corresponding to fisheries agreements, despite the fact that the rapporteur appears to have forgotten that the majority of these funds are now intended to meet the costs of development aid, and not the commercial part of those agreements. Furthermore, the usual cliché of linking the funding of fisheries agreements to prior cost-benefit analyses is not practical at this stage. Firstly, the ex-ante
 and ex-post
 studies carried out by the Commission for each protocol show that the agreements are still bringing benefits that are greater than the cost to the European Union and, at the same time, due to their new status as association agreements, we need to take account of other parameters which cannot be measured by means of a mere cost-benefit analysis. Secondly, neither do we agree that Natura 2000 network measures should be funded by means of CFP funds. In this regard, I would refer to what this Parliament said in the Böge report on the financial perspective. Finally, and with regard to the regional fisheries committees, I do not believe that there is any justification, for the moment at least, for extending the period for their funding laid down in Community legislation, particularly when the majority of the RACs are not yet operating, since less than half of those planned have been set up. The logical thing is for the RAC to be an instrument that will eventually be self-funding, if it is as useful as we hope, and not to become an additional burden for contributors, particularly within a policy for which the financial contribution is always below the minimums.

Mr President, thank you very much for your words, Commissioner. I believe that the Fisheries Agreement with the Seychelles demonstrates clearly that the objectives of this Community policy are in very good health, despite the criticisms from some quarters, and that this kind of protocol is still essential in order to maintain competitiveness and employment for the Community sector, while it is increasingly involved in the promotion of more responsible fisheries systems outside of Community seas. The activity planned for 40 seiners and 12 long liners will enable the Seychelles to benefit, as has been said, from more than EUR 4 million per year, of which 36% will be intended to support their fisheries sector. If we add the contribution of shipowners through various elements, however, such as advances for licences, levies, taxes, provisions and the salaries of island seamen, this figure rises, as indicated in the Commission’s assessment report, Mrs Attwooll, to between EUR 17 and 20 million, since, furthermore, Victoria, which is the base port for the whole of the tuna fleet in the Indian Ocean, creates great wealth for the Seychelles. In view of this, Commissioner, I believe that this is the time to demand that the Commission give better treatment to shipowners, through the implementation, once and for all, of agreements of a regional nature, which prevent unnecessary multiplications of certain aspects that appear in all of the protocols of the region, in this case the Indian Ocean, such as the need to have an agent in each country, or to take on board seamen in each coastal State and also observers for each of the protocols, while, through rotating systems, all of the countries could benefit equally without leading to ridiculous and indiscriminate increases in costs for shipowners. For some time the Commission itself has recognised the need to establish this kind of agreement for fleets that fish within a single area, and I would therefore call upon the Commission, together with Community tuna shipowners, to work to take steps forward that can bee seen as significant in this area.

Mr President, I have come here to talk about a sector that is being particularly affected by this situation: the fisheries sector. I agree with the Commission that it is necessary to draw up a medium- and long-term action plan, which enables the fleet to deal with a state of affairs which is evidently structural rather than temporary, although I must also make it clear that I do not deny that some of the solutions which the Directorate-General for fisheries is indicating, for energy saving, such as the scrapping of the Community fleet, are a cause of very great concern to many of us. I believe that, when preparing for the future, we must also take account of the present, since the fleet is already in a desperate situation and we are not convinced by the short-term measures indicated at the last Council of Fisheries Ministers. The temporary halts of the FIFG have not been designed to deal with this kind of crisis, because the governments, furthermore, have already allocated their funds and reprogramming is problematic. Commissioner Borg’s announcement on the increase in de minimis aid does not sort the problem out either, since we will have to wait for nine months and for new Community rules in order for this to be resolved. This is leading many Member States to help their sectors as best they can, which also causes significant distortions of competition. We would therefore once again call on the Commission, represented here by the Energy Commissioner, as we did a year ago, to enable the fisheries sector to escape from this crisis, which would involve introducing a mechanism that can be brought into play automatically when there are sudden or continuous rises in fuel prices, and that it should be mobilised before fishing companies begin to collapse en masse.

Mr President, I am sure that this House, like the Committee on Fisheries, will support the signing of this Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and the Comoros, which follows on from previous protocols and which will enable 57 Community vessels to fish until 2010. This agreement also represents a further step in the new model of association agreements intended to promote even greater cooperation and greater involvement in the development of the third country’s fisheries sector. Nevertheless, while we support the principles behind this model, we must insist that it is far from clear. Firstly, it is the first one to reach Parliament in which, unilaterally and without any request from the third country, the Commission has decided to raise the sum paid by shipowners per tonne fished from EUR 25 to 35, that is to say by 40%, and without having consulted them. The Commission defends itself by saying that the rise was anticipated in the conclusions of the 2004 Council of Ministers, but what we all deduced from those conclusions was that there would be a gradual increase in these payments, when in reality there has been a rather brutal rise by decree. This Parliament, like the sector, finds itself faced with a fait accompli
 policy, carried out by the Commission’s negotiators quite independently, and without giving us the opportunity to examine those decisions more than fleetingly, and the protocol reaches our committee – increasingly late by the way – signed and sealed. Our Institution does not believe that this situation of obscurantism should continue. I therefore propose in my report that shipowners now be allowed to attend joint committees so that they can at least be informed in real time of what is being prepared for them. As far as Parliament is concerned, I would like to take this opportunity to ask once again – and this time I am addressing the Council, which is not present – for a member of the Committee on Fisheries to be present in the negotiations as an observer. We genuinely do not understand why it objects, since an observer cannot interfere in the decision-making, but if we were to be present, we would be better informed, which cannot do any harm, unless the negotiators have something to hide. Equally serious, from a budgetary point of view this time, is the fact that, contrary to the Council’s conclusions, some of these agreements, such as the one we are dealing with today, are not respecting the obligatory differentiation between what is paid in return for fishing opportunities and what is paid as development aid. From the point of view of budgetary transparency, this situation is unacceptable. Furthermore, the Commission is clearly aware of it and has admitted to the Committee on Fisheries that it is failing to comply with this obligation. However, it is not giving the slightest indication of what has led it to do so, at least in this case. Finally, Mr President, for the sake of the necessary simplification and following an admirable period of patience on the part of this Parliament, the time has come to demand that the Commission present its model for regional agreements and, in particular, the tuna type of agreement. As we know, the tuna fleet is requesting fishing licences from each country of the area so that it can follow schools of tuna that cross the different fishing grounds. This currently obliges it to take on a significant number of seamen from each of the countries, which turns each vessel into a miniature United Nations, sometimes causing insurmountable problems with languages, customs, traditions and also space, not to mention cost. This is a totally absurd situation, as is the uncertainty over some of the more practical aspects, such as the actual definition of a tide or, for example, the mechanics of electronic transmissions. It may be understandable that negotiators do not take account of these details, but if we put ourselves in the shoes of a skipper for a moment, we will realise that, at the end of the day, his main concerns are administrative and personnel issues rather than the fishing itself. Mr President, while calling, naturally, for the approval of this agreement, which is essential to the European supply of tuna and to the fisheries sector of the Comoros, I would like account to be taken of the comments I have made here.

Mr President, I would like to begin by defending the excellent work and the difficult consensus achieved by the rapporteur, Mr Casa, in the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries. Secondly, I would also call on the critics of the fisheries restructuring policy to leave behind the hackneyed argument that a fishing vessel or an aquacultural plant are synonymous with environmental disaster and rather to give them their support. I can assure you that, with the budget reserved for us by the European Fisheries Fund — 4 900 million for six years and 27 countries, which represents an increase of just 1 500 million on the current fund for 15 countries — we can do little damage to the environment or the Community’s budget. I believe that the report has sensibly introduced more measures than were contained in the Commission's proposal, with a view to providing greater flexibility and thereby enabling the Member States to respond better to their various sectors. We have extended the cases eligible for renovation and modernisation of the fleet, because it is difficult to understand why we are condemning certain professions to work with obsolete and dangerous means of production, in particular the small-scale fleet, which is the most outdated. To express our regret at accidents a posteriori
 and to pay tribute to the victims is of little use. But now we have the opportunity to help to prevent them since, furthermore, we now have a whole range of methods of teledetection and satellite monitoring, in order to prevent too much from being fished or the wrong things being fished. Mr President, allow me to say a final word about mixed companies. I believe them to be the guarantee of an effective development aid and cooperation policy and, in accordance with the Commission’s support for them within the new policy on association agreements, I would like to defend them. However, Commissioner, I do not believe that it is possible for mixed companies to be created in developing third countries without the corresponding Community assistance, since these countries do not have the same legal guarantees for investments. So if we really want mixed companies to be a cornerstone of development cooperation, Commissioner, let us give them assistance from the EFF.

Mr President, through this report, for which it has been my pleasure to be rapporteur, we finally have the opportunity to produce a fisheries management system for the Mediterranean, eleven years after the first attempt to impose order by means of the technical measures regulation, Regulation No 1696/94. This is therefore a crucial moment for the fisheries sector in the area, and for having made it possible for us to reach this moment, I must fully acknowledge the work of Commissioner Joe Borg and Director-General Jörgen Holmquist — who have been personally involved in moving this dossier forward — their services, with whom I have worked on a daily basis, and of course my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, who have been wise and generous enough to give up many of their local sectors’ demands, sometimes despite strong pressure, in order not to deprive the whole Mediterranean sector of common management rules. With everybody’s involvement, we have been able to unblock the Commission’s initial proposal which, perhaps because it was drawn up too quickly, had opened up apparently insoluble conflicts with the national administrations, with the sector and with this Parliament, which, as you will remember, rejected the proposal by means of the report by Mr Lisi. In order to get out of this impasse
, I proposed to the Commission that we work in unison on a common text on the points on which there was the greatest controversy, with a view to achieving a joint compromise acceptable to Parliament and the Commission which we would then present once again to the Council of Ministers. The Commission accepted this method and, following a very hard negotiation and almost a year’s work, this is what we are presenting to the House today for its approval. It may not be as ambitious a text as many of us would have liked; perhaps no one got everything they wanted. But we have all lost a little so that we may all emerge winners, because, if there was one thing we all agreed upon, it was that the situation of fishing in the Mediterranean could not remain at the mercy of a minimal regulation, which complicated more than it resolved. If politics is a question of sacrificing individual interests for the sake of the common good, I believe that we can feel satisfied with our work on approving this report, which demonstrates that, when we work together, it is easier to make progress, and also that when a text that is balanced, and agreed amongst everybody, is presented to the governments, it is more easily accepted and therefore easier to apply. This working method has also allowed us to avoid leaps into the dark with no scientific or logical basis, and certain contradictions in the initial text which led to the outright rejection of the proposal. For example, we introduce rationality and consistency into the regulation of the depths and distances from the coast within which it is possible to fish in such a biologically-, economically- and socially-sensitive sea. For the first time, dredges are regulated, the way is opened for the use of more selective meshes — such as square mesh for towed nets — and considerable progress is made on bringing mesh size into line with the minimum sizes of species. Furthermore, with regard to the Commission’s maximal initiative on bans, minimum sizes and hooks for the fishing of highly migratory species, it has been agreed firstly to attempt to get the regional fisheries organisations, such as the GFCM and the ICCAT, to produce these regulations, since this fishing is also carried out in the Mediterranean by third-country fleets and it does not make sense to impose restrictions solely on Community vessels. Nevertheless, if within a period of one year, these international bodies do not achieve a common rule, the Commission will be empowered to present a new proposal, since we do not want to ignore our responsibilities, stemming from our strong presence in the fishing grounds. With regard to the content of the report, I would finally like to stress the effort to provide greater protection for species by means of minimum sizes, with the only temporary exception of hake, where we worked on the basis of a Commission proposal to lower the size to 15 cm — which we have maintained until 2007, when the traditional size of 20 cm will return, coinciding with the proposed increase in mesh. Furthermore, for the first time, the size of sardine is regulated, sizes that had disappeared from the Commission’s proposal are recovered, such as the size of clam or striped venus, and reasonable increases in size are introduced for other species, since the ultimate objective is to move closer to the scientific recommendations in the Mediterranean as well. Mr President, having once again called upon this House to approve this report and, in particular, the compromise reached with the Commission, I shall end by expressing my hope that the Council will fully accept this new proposal, which is the result of this compromise between the European Commission and the European Parliament.

Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs, and in particular Mrs Miguélez, because I am going to refer to her report, but not because the report of the chairman of the committee is not magnificent. Firstly, I would like to point out that the first discrepancy between the Commission and the fishing sector usually relates to the duration of plans. In this regard, we must bear in mind that establishing a plan for the recovery of a species with a short life and rapid growth is not the same as establishing a plan for another species with the opposite characteristics. Furthermore, great emphasis must be placed, as many previous speakers have said, on the socio-economic effects of each plan, which vary widely depending on the fleets in question. In this case, therefore, we have established a minimum duration for recovery of ten years, which allows these conditions to be taken into account. We must insist that the first stage in any recovery plan must be to prevent a continuing decline of the species in question and for its recovery to begin. The speed with which this is achieved is of less biological relevance, but may be a disaster for the regions dependent on fishing. We therefore believe that once the scientists have established the biological parameters — and this report includes, for example, the biomass objective to be achieved in order for a population to be considered recovered — the Member States must be allowed a degree of flexibility in achieving this objective in a manner most suited to the characteristics of their fleets. Once again, the important thing is that the species recovers, rather than how the reduction of the fishing effort is achieved. So, as Mr Freitas has said, we have presented an amendment on behalf of our group which calls for greater flexibility for fleets. With regard to the issue of closures, I would refer to what the rapporteur has said; there is no scientific basis for it and, therefore, I would simply call on the Commission and the Council to support the amendments by Mrs Miguélez and the Committee on Fisheries, which introduce a good dose of common sense into this proposal.

Mr President, Commissioner, the great options for European aid for the countries affected must be mobilised as soon as possible and, as you have acknowledged, this Parliament has done its duty by approving the urgent procedure. Nevertheless, we also believe that it is important to do things quickly, but to do them well. In this regard, we can only applaud the fact that humanitarian aid is being directed towards the fishing sector in question, but we believe that opting exclusively for the transfer of vessels is not the most appropriate approach. The Commissioner says that she agrees with the spirit of many of the amendments; we would have liked the Commission to have presented a full package of measures to alleviate the problems faced by this sector and we believe that the method presented is not appropriate, since it has been rejected by the NGOs working in the area, which have received this proposal with great reservations. The FAO itself has stated that our good intentions may aggravate the problem rather than resolve it and, as far as I know, two countries have said that they do not want ships to be sent, and some of them have extreme restrictions such as, for example, the prohibition of fishing by vessels of more than 10 horsepower. It is therefore not sufficient simply to ensure that we do not send large vessels, as the proposal states, but rather we must send appropriate vessels to the area, which are designed to anchor at shallow beaches and are made with materials which are resistant, amongst other things, to high tropical temperatures and humidity. There is a further problem, that of funding, and we had been promised it would be resolved. In this case, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said, there is no extra funding, which means that this burden is going to affect countries at the expense of an FIFG which has already been promised to them, and I very much doubt that this proposal can be at all effective. For all these reasons, we would ask that the amendments which have been presented by the majority of these groups, which we have all signed and which we are going to support, and which propose other alternatives and furthermore propose accepting the European Commission’s proposal, be seen as a political message from this Parliament to the European Commission and the Council, and I hope it will become effective over the coming weeks.

Commissioner, I, on the other hand, do support and applaud the creation of the Fisheries Control Agency and I would therefore simply ask that it become operational as soon as possible. Furthermore, the amendments introduced by the Committee on Fisheries considerably improve and supplement both the Commission’s initial proposal and the rapporteur’s report in terms of the genuine responsibilities the Agency should have and without prejudice to the competences that currently fall to the Member States. This report confirms my conviction that it is not possible to have sustainable resources and restructure fishing practices unless the control policy is dealt with in an honest and unhypocritical way and, unfortunately, this proposal has once again highlighted that some of the countries that talk most about control are then the most reticent, rejecting serious and effective proposals. This Agency is a step in the right direction in terms of increasing the prominence of those attitudes and, although there is still much to be done, in particular, in relation to the transparency of the criteria for inspections by Member States and European harmonisation on legislation and penalties, having it will be the best guarantee that this can be resolved in the near future. The Committee on Fisheries has also improved the way the proposal treated the sector and in that regard, Commissioner, I do not agree that the Commission should not accept the proposals, because the sector is given a genuine voice and representation in an area that affects it so much and in which it would be crazy not to have its support, and the responsibilities of the Agency have been increased in order to try to make the Commission take its responsibilities seriously in relation to non-declared and non-regulated illegal fishing once and for all. I would also like to acknowledge the efforts the rapporteur has made in order to seek areas of compromise, and I would like to end by expressing my pleasure at the fact that this Agency is going to be based in Spain, in the city of Vigo, a city which is so significant in terms of world fishing.

Mr President, I must begin by saying how surprised I was to hear Mr Ribeiro, the rapporteur, speak in favour of amendments rejected by a majority of the Committee on Fisheries. I should now like to make it clear that our group will support the Commission’s proposal, namely the Ribeiro report, as it was adopted in the Committee on Fisheries. We shall be voting against the amendments tabled, for the reasons I am about to give. We are opposed to the inclusion of bottom set gill nets because, as everyone is aware, these are static nets. By their very nature, they do not erode the sea bottom. The amendment concerned refers to a possible biological disaster. At most, this could be linked to the loss of these nets and subsequent so-called ghost fishing.
 As the Commissioner stated, there is no scientific data relating to areas or species. This is why I think it is somewhat flippant and a bad precedent to ban or attempt to ban gear of this kind in the areas in question. Indeed, to follow the arguments through, the gear would have to be banned from all Community waters. It would be interesting to see if those who are in favour of a ban in this case would also be in favour of a more general ban. I shall now turn to the second amendment. On the basis of criteria derived from marine geology and biology, this amendment calls for the protected areas proposed by the Commission to be replaced by the 200-mile political criterion. It should be pointed out that, rightly or wrongly, that criterion is no longer relevant to fisheries management under Community law. I must emphasise once again that coral reefs are not located exclusively within a 200-mile radius from the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores. The scientific community accepts that coral reefs are generally found around a 1 000 metre bathymetric line. In accordance with the precautionary principle, the Commission has therefore gone up to the 1 500 metre bathymetric line.
 These lines do not of course tally with political and administrative demarcations. In addition, in this particular instance, the zones designated by the European Commission extend beyond the 200-mile limit in some cases. International waters are affected. Mr President, these are the reasons why our group will not support the amendments tabled.

Mr President, I too would like to thank the general rapporteur for the budget and I must point out that the majority of our amendments have been accepted by the Committee on Budgets. What have been the essential objectives of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries? Firstly, to reincorporate the appropriations unjustifiably cut by the Council from the draft preliminary budget presented by the Commission in relation to two important issues: international fisheries agreements in relation to cuts of payments from the financial instrument for fisheries guidance. Secondly, there has been an amendment, also accepted by the Committee on Budgets, relating to the new Community agency for fisheries control, in which this Parliament has shown great interest and which requires a contribution so that it can be implemented urgently. I would like to insist on two amendments, which have been rejected by the Committee on Budgets, and which I would like to present once again. They are Amendments Nos 98 and 99. The first, relating to the regional advisory councils, and the second, relating to the increase in aid for improving scientific information. Mr President, the fisheries advisory councils have been the great innovation of the reform and the only instrument we have for ensuring the participation of the sector in the decision-making process. This Parliament's objective is for all the councils provided for in the Community legislation to be operational during next year and in order to achieve this, we need an increase of some EUR 500 000. In the second case, relating to improving scientific information, neither the Council nor the Commission have provided for an increase on last year. Neither does the Sixth Framework Research Programme provide for anything. We believe that a budget of EUR 1.5 million for this issue is not too much to ask. Mr President, I believe that we, unlike other committees, have only proposed an increase of EUR 3 million compared to the preliminary draft budget; I would therefore ask you to support the amendments of the Committee on Fisheries.

Mr President, I would like firstly to express my regret at the fact that today this House has missed an opportunity to provide the citizens with a package of real solutions to the crisis the price of oil is causing in certain sectors, as our Committee on Fisheries had initially proposed. In particular – and the Commissioner has mentioned this – the consequences for the fisheries sector are extremely serious, and neither the Community institutions nor certain Member States, including my own, I regret to say, are taking any measures. Our Parliament has decided not take any action either, preferring a mere Commission statement to committing ourselves to a resolution, as proposed by our political group. This statement today is of little or no use to fisheries, because we already know Commissioner Fischler’s opinion, which is that we should pass the rises on to the consumer. The problem is that the Commissioner – and I am delighted that you have said quite the opposite today, Commissioner – did not know that this solution was impossible for the fisheries sector, since it is governed by a system of Dutch auction. The situation is very different, Mr President. The oil price crises of 1993, 1994, 2002 and 2004 show that this is not a problem specific to the current situation, but a cyclical problem, and we must work on the basis that cycles will become shorter and shorter, since we are talking about an exhaustible energy source. We are, therefore, dealing with a structural deficiency which must be dealt with through structural measures. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is therefore calling for the implementation of a Community instrument which can be mobilised almost automatically during these periods of crisis. Furthermore, however, we need urgent measures for supporting the sector until that instrument becomes part of Community legislation; and we propose that these measures include the granting of low-interest or zero-interest loans and setting a maximum price, compensation in line with the real price by means of financial measures and temporary reductions in social and fiscal burdens.

 Mr President, I would like to say that we need to send realistic messages to our citizens, as the Commissioner has tried to do. Science is much better prepared to face this pandemic than it was four years ago, and this can be seen from the low number of deaths occurring. A great deal more is known about avian and human cases and about the transmission history of this swine influenza. A good deal more is known about the solutions and I believe, therefore, we should trust in research, promote research and demand far more research into vaccines, as Mr Trakatellis also said. We also know that society is much better prepared than it was a while ago, thanks to the wealth of experience and the organisational efforts made in every country, particularly those in Europe, in an effort to prevent further spread, stockpile medicines and provide citizens with a comprehensive service. Nevertheless, I am concerned that those citizens may not be receiving enough information. If we look at the press we can see that 90% – or even more – of the material being printed focuses on falling infection rates, but very little is said of cures or how citizens should act. I believe a great deal more information is needed. I also feel that greater political effort is required with regard to our citizens. To give an example, I am struck by the fact that not a single Member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has come to the debate, that all their seats are empty and nobody has asked for the floor in order to justify this situation, when this matter goes beyond individual parties and is of concern to all governments. I also wish to stress that we can give third countries a helping hand, as the speaker before me said. We need to give our support to all those countries that do not have the conditions, the basis or the capacity to provide assistance to all their citizens. Therefore, the Europe of solidarity must take action, as must the Europe of communication.

 Mr President, it is clear to us and to Europe, to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and to us in Europe, that energy has become a foreign policy tool, an element of change that is capable of sparking conflicts or uniting us, and this is precisely the subject that concerns us today. Traditionally, Europe has been united with Russia. Our history shows that in its development Belarus was clearly  influenced by the West, and Russian tradition, in terms of religion, all forms of education and most value systems, has followed a European way of thinking that has enriched Russia. Our culture has also been enhanced by the tradition of scientists from Russia, great mathematicians from Kazan and other corners, and the same is true of its literature. I believe we should think of the tensions of the socialist era as an intermission that should be remembered, but they do not constitute a constant factor. Our constant experience with Russia has been one of unity; that is why I say that in the area of energy, where Europe has deficiencies, we must let Russia know that our friendship should continue, but with clear rules, as gentlemen always had and as we have always had, but now in the form of written rules. We cannot live in continuous uncertainty as to whether our citizens’ supply may be cut off once again, and Russia must also recognise that it cannot use energy as a tool to avoid having to recognise the sovereignty of neighbouring States. The situation at present is one of people who have achieved independence and who are fully exercising democracy, over whom we should keep watch and over whom Russia has a duty to keep watch, just as it has a duty to provide a clear set of rules for energy exchange and unity through energy.

 Mr President, I naturally voted against the Auken report, and I should like to state here that the report that has been adopted goes against the letter of the law. It does not comply in any way with the principles of law that the European Union has declared, and it is absolutely appalling that the European Parliament has been capable of approving this document, which has been described by the Legal Services as non-compliant with the law and full of illegalities. The report proposes the suspension of all building projects, as if that would solve the problems. That is something that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has been advocating for several years. This document does not resolve the real problems faced by the people, which have largely been resolved by the changing of a law, as has already been done, and by the efforts that the Spanish authorities are making to correct mistakes that have clearly been made. To sum up, I should like to point out that the destruction of the majority of the properties is due to poor application of the Coastal Law by Mr Zapatero’s Socialist government, who are acting in an arbitrary manner, and arbitrarily seizing properties in just one area of Spain.

 Mr President, on this subject I want to do two things: firstly, congratulate the Commission and Mrs Grossetête, and, secondly, talk about subsidiarity. I have frequently criticised the European Union in this respect, as, for example, with the Services Directive and also the current attack on pharmacies in the name of liberalisation. In these examples, the European Commission has entered into areas which properly come under subsidiarity and which have been developed for each individual society and with which this society is content. In other words, the European Union’s meddling could damage what is working effectively, as in the case of pharmacies. However, in the present case, I feel that this report must be clearly welcomed, bearing in mind that it represents the only way of controlling quality and guaranteeing good health. Why? The reason is that, without a single point of control for all medicinal products, there are too many avenues left open and the system is much more vulnerable to infiltration by harmful or unauthorised products. This is also true in the case of active ingredients on which there was a resolution last year, tabled by Mrs Sartori and myself, which I see has been taken up by the Commission. I therefore feel that this is a good proposal which will cut through a lot of red tape and offer safeguards to society. I also welcome the emphasis placed on information because it is clear that, in a society with patient mobility as it is, where patients can easily travel for treatment and where many elderly people live in countries other than their countries of origin, it is very important that doctors and all health care staff can have access to the same information and criteria in their work.

Mr President, I have to say that I voted against this report, because it is a bad report. The subject of climate change is an all-embracing one and water scarcity is an issue that also affects land and requires a comprehensive approach. This document seems to be claiming that the only solution is to conserve tap water and water in our cities’ pipes. This is a reductionist, unsystematic and unsustainable approach. I opposed the report even though it makes some good points, such as the fact that water must be for all or that we must share resources and that there must be solidarity among regions. However, I agree with Mr Hegyi that we need to take action with regard to land. The new approach consists of conserving water on land through new dams, new river regulation, disaster prevention, new agricultural strategies that allow a fresh approach and, of course, water diversion where necessary. Social and economic concerns have a bearing on people’s lives and in terms of the food shortages the world is facing. This is what should have been taken into account in this motion for a resolution.
 Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE-DE

 – (ES)
 Mr President, I welcome the fact that there is a document on water, although I think that, unfortunately, this document, because of climate change issues, has been reduced to a partial and very specific view of the subject, which is water saving . Despite this, I commend several things that Mr Seeber has highlighted and expanded on based on the Commission document, by making it clear that water is everyone’s right – water for all – and that we need to take into account that we need to have closer cooperation between the regions, which is a phenomenon that I do not think is up to date right now, and which is a good lesson for all those who believe that water belongs to whoever has it in a river in their backyard. I have to say, however, that I think that we have to start thinking in terms of water and climate change from an overall perspective. There are three problems in the world at present: one is hunger and food shortages, another is climate change, and another is drought, which is a problem that we have had for many centuries. An increase in resources is essential and it is not dealt with here. We need to multiply the existing resources, and this is only mentioned in amendments made by Parliament. Not only desalination; we will also have to regulate the rivers again, and think about new engineering and new water paradigm, consisting of making every effort to ensure that water remains in the land: through reforestation, drought tanks to recover water during floods, recharging aquifers during floods and another set of measures. We also need to think about an agricultural strategy for producing products that can generate the same plant mass as is produced now, but with a strategy focused on new crops that can grow with little water. For the same reason, we need to talk about a water economy, as it is not only a question of rising prices as has been said here, or of real prices, but rather there is a much more complex water economy. Therefore agriculture strategy, consumption strategy, land treatment, river regulation and, if water needs to be diverted, it should be. What is important is for the world to continue to be sustainable, thinking about people and the economy.

 Mr President, I wish to direct my comments at the Minister in particular because I believe that her intellectual capacity will allow her to understand that this is a completely new issue. The Commission, in line with its usual practices, presented a binding and, to a certain extent, reductionist directive. However, here in Parliament we realised that such a complex system as the soil could only be tackled on a comprehensive and theoretical basis. This is because soil affects the capture of CO2
, it is the setting for human life, and it affects the productive system, agriculture, natural disasters and the creation of infrastructures. In short it affects everything and we understood that, in the case of 27 countries with very long legislative experience, many of these could not apply a directive based on simplistic criteria and extensive comitology. As a result, for the first time in the history of this Parliament, we developed a directive that was open, flexible, based on systematic criteria of self-organisation and aimed at a new development of Article 249 of the Treaty, which establishes that the Member States must have the same objectives and must meet these objectives, but allows them freedom in their application. In this directive, existing legislation, existing catalogues and the bureaucracies of each country are respected. There is no obligation for the countries to do anything new if they can prove that the objectives of the directive have been met. Many of these countries have already fully met all these objectives. However, many Members have not understood this interaction between freedom and complexity, that order is possible within an open system and that open and flexible systems can exist within self-organisation. They have preferred to turn their backs on this legislation which affects life and the earth. I do not understand how governments concerned about climate change can allow themselves to oppose a directive that tackles the problems of the soil, the earth and climate change and that encourages disaster prevention, supports reforestation, agriculture and productivity, and respects all previous agreements. I repeat that we must understand what freedom is, as many do not know how to live with this.

Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze, who has worked extraordinarily hard with other colleagues in my Group, and with Parliament as a whole, to reach agreement and form a consensus. I am very pleased with this Directive, which deals with several important issues. First, as Mrs Lienemann said, sustainability is a process, and water treatment, improvements in the quality of water and water policy form part of a process that we began many years ago. Above all, it is a process that has to be realistic, because it has to be put into practice. It is much easier to legislate than implement. It is much cheaper to legislate than implement. It does not cost anything to ban something. However, implementation means that companies, farmers and local councils have to put policies into practice, which is not always easy. I think that this is an important step forward, but we have to be realistic, because, as we saw yesterday, for example, in the referendum, it is sometimes not easy to be European. It costs money and effort and that is something we are doing right now, especially considering that this is a policy that applies Europe-wide. The entire water policy has to be implemented throughout Europe, and we therefore have to deal with enormously complex situations, with many factors, including extremely important geophysical factors. I would like to mention two other aspects of this directive that I think represent progress. First, it requires much more transparency from governments. Water has always been rather opaque. In the European Water Forum,
 one of our objectives is transparency in providing information to the public, and we are now seriously addressing our commitment to transparency of information to the public. The same is true of the indicators, including molluscs, and I want to emphasise the importance of water analysis for health.

 Mr President, I wish to thank Karl-Heinz Florenz and the entire working group for having brought in such high-level scientists to work on this issue. I think it is the first time that scientists have worked alongside Members of this House. This is an asset that must not be discarded since it is clear, as the scientists have stated, that we face enormous uncertainty in the shape of climate change. In other words, science is progressing and is changing its opinions as it goes, and thus we cannot turn science into absolute truths. What does this mean? It means that if scientists, in their work, are constantly reviewing their findings and we are following along behind, then we must also be flexible and adapt our solutions to the changes in knowledge. This symmetry between ever-increasing knowledge and our own flexibility is very important. Thus one of my concerns is the enormous confidence we have in ourselves in Europe. Doubt and uncertainty form the basis of scientific work, and of getting it right in this case. I think we have to be aware of the fact that there may be other countries, those we are criticising, that are doing the right thing in certain areas. I say this, and I must reiterate that I support the project, for I believe that the concepts of complexity and impact must be taken into consideration, and this is borne out by what has happened to us with biofuels. We must also be ruled by absolute discipline in relation to environmental impact, economic impact and feasibility of the solutions. Since the aim of this document is not to provide solutions, however, I continue to support it. Nevertheless I would also say that we must apply a combined policy, and here the document must move one step forward in the second part, with decisions taken from above at state level, without neglecting the fact that climate change is an issue which must be solved by adaptation at local level. We must therefore start contemplating a policy of broad climate change knowledge from above, in combination with a policy operated from below, in industry, in economic sectors, in agriculture, in our various territories, to allow each country to draw up its own project in line with the general project.
 Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines  (PPE-DE

 Thank you, Mr President. I think that the role of, and document on, adaptation are important. Nevertheless, the problem of climate change is a work in progress: we are constantly learning and understanding what is happening and what the possible solutions are. I think that it is vital to ensure that the policy as a whole does not take a top-down approach. If we want to take the lead in this field, we have to ensure that others follow us; otherwise, the leader will stand alone. There is the risk that if Europe advances too rapidly, if it causes a crisis in industry, if it only implements policies – I should say ‘metapolicies’ – from the top down, it will not work. We must use all means of action on the ground, get society enthusiastically involved, and adapt to our own society’s capacity for adaptation, because we must not let our welfare suffer. In this respect, I would also stress that this document makes very little mention of adaptation on the ground, and it is something we need to talk about. Particularly when talking about the topic of water, which is crucial and which is going to be the aspect most affected by climate change, if it is not already, it is important to remember to focus on formulas and actions on the ground – which are often very simple – with regard to soil permeability, reforestation, water harvesting, using existing reservoirs to harvest water surpluses, and properly distributing the few resources we have left rather than letting the water run out to sea and be lost. To achieve this, sometimes we need to look to the past, to the existing traditions, and sometimes we need to lose our prejudices against solutions such as aquifer recharges and other essential measures. I am therefore calling for integrated policies, all-encompassing policies that we can adapt to society, which must listen to our recommendations and comply with them. If society is not behind us and is not enthusiastic, we will achieve nothing. Therefore, we need to strive for a consensus and listen to everyone.

Madam President, I really do not think that the document that we are considering is what it could be, and I will explain: it is a document to assess what has been done with the broad guidelines that the European Commission had proposed for the environment, and for all environmental policy. I do not think that it is an assessment document. It is not a detailed assessment document that could have helped us to plan for the future, perhaps because the Commission is not accustomed to being judged or assessed, nor does it vote, or have a group of shareholders that demand results from it. I do think, however, although it may appear to be a contradiction, that the Commission can be congratulated on the results that it has had in recent years, but not on the document. I think that environmental policy has been absolutely integrated into municipal and regional policies, and industry itself is responding to the European Union guidelines. However, the document lacks a projection of how we need to change for the future, because those points where the system has not worked well need to be reviewed. Europe has been making environmental policy for more than 25 years and it needs to review some of its methods, because this is not the only thing that explains the failure of some policies. I do not see any examination of how we can change the ways that we involve the regions and create networks, whether or not these are EU dominated in attitude. There are now many countries, as happened with the Soil Directive, that already have much better regulations than Europe can give them and others that do not have any. In response to this imbalance, Europe needs to take different positions and look for new ways of working, because it is logical that, if the world has changed, we should change our working methods. Thank you very much, congratulations on the results but let us change in the future.

 Mr President, I have no doubt that the legal procedures have been followed correctly; with a minimum of compulsion shall we say. I am approaching the Commission to seek its help as guardian of the Treaties and I appeal to its conscience to reject the measures and to apply the environmental impact directive scrupulously in that capacity. The fact that this part of the tunnel is not going to be funded by the European Union is beside the point as we are all aware that splitting projects into sections is bad practice and, indeed, one which the European Union has had occasion to criticise. Why was the AVE not declared a major project requiring detailed impact studies given that we know that it will go under very sensitive areas such as the Pedrera and, especially, alongside the Sagrada Familia? The spirit of Article 3 of the EIA Directive requires assessment to be made of potential repercussions on the cultural heritage. The 40-metre-deep protective wall which is to be built is only one and a half metres away from the façade of the Sagrada Familia, which weighs 40 000 tonnes. Moreover, given the characteristics of the terrain and the fact that the cathedral is an extremely intricate work of genius, all I ask is for all sides to be heard and taken into account. I am very glad that the AVE is on its way but this is not a party-political issue, it was the PP that changed the route and I now think that it should be changed once again to run along Valencia Street.

Mr President, I would like to appeal for responsibility on the part of the Council, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission on the Soil Directive that is before the Council. After wide-ranging debates, Parliament approved a proposal that was much more open, less bureaucratic and much more flexible than the Commission’s. It approved it after many debates, by 496 votes to 161. This was a message we sent to the Council, that it was unable to negotiate sufficiently last week. The Council and the Commission failed to understand that Parliament was proposing a new way of legislating in the Europe of 27, with different regulatory developments and experiences, and different bureaucratic systems. We need to look for new ways of getting closer to the citizen. The solution is not to legislate less, not a legislative blackout, but rather to find more open and flexible formulae as proposed by Parliament. We proposed a document defining the result to be achieved – as Article 249 of the Treaty says – and, in exchange, to leave to the Member States the choice of form and methods. If Europe wants to lead the way on climate change and the environment, it cannot rely only on policies based on regulation, taxation and the judicialisation of environment policy. We need to learn to understand one another in liberty and flexibility. That is what is being asked of a young Europe.

(ES) 
Madam President, before discussing the proposal that is going to be voted on this morning, I would like to thank the rapporteurs from all the political groups, and I would especially like to thank Mrs Sornosa, from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and our friend Mr Prodi, who have really worked side by side and have enriched the directive, as have the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and many other Members. The document that is going to be voted on tomorrow has several amendments, which were the result of an agreement, and it has therefore been enriched by contributions from other political parties. It is a document that is largely based on a consensus, which is unexpected in an environmental policy that it could be said is going to generate a new European policy and is opening up a new path. This document is extremely innovative, as it is responding to a new way of tackling directives. We were facing the problem that, out of 27 countries, only nine had soil protection legislation, and this is an issue that we are going to have to tackle again in the future. Europe has developed asymmetrically, and there are currently many countries that are at doctorate level in terms of soil policy while others are only doing their A-levels. How can we arrive at a policy of consensus, a common policy, when there are such huge differences? This is the challenge with which we were faced. What was the solution? We went to the Treaty and saw that when defining directives, Article 249 states that directives are common objectives, but that the implementation and application of them can be left up to the Member States, and this is what was done. Articles 1 and 2 have been strengthened right up to Article 6 in order to make the common objectives clear. In other words, we have set out the goal. We know the goal that we need to get to, and we have to recognise that sustainability is a process that needs to have clear goals, but not all countries can move at the same pace. Those who have not yet begun to advance cannot be asked to do the same as the rest. We therefore ask for implementation to be left in the hands of the Member States, with maximum respect for subsidiarity, thus eliminating the fear in some countries that have already made progress that their official arrangements will be repeated. There is no need for those countries that have clear soil protection to do it all over again. This policy of flexibility also applies to recognising that, given the climate and conditions in each country, each one needs to be allowed to come to an agreement with its citizens in order to implement these policies. Therefore, for example, in Article 8 we guarantee that farmers can make an agreement with their Member States on soil conservation, and those that have already done so will not have to repeat the legislation. This means that at the same time we need to ensure that there is a clear policy on contaminated soil and, in this respect, the health of citizens comes before everything else, along with the objectives of protecting health and being transparent in providing information to citizens; this is clear. Why do I think it is important for there to be a directive, in the face of the critics that do not want one? It is important, ladies and gentlemen, because we have to build Europe based on our strengths, so we need to follow those countries that have done things well. On the other hand, if we do not legislate we will enter into uncertainty and insecurity, and insecurity and uncertainty undermine the market and health. Let us build Europe around its strengths, not its weaknesses. This is the path that we have to take. Moreover, subsidiarity is being guaranteed, and it is being stated that there does not need to be duplication of official arrangements or of legislation. Member States are being given responsibility for carrying it out, and freedom means responsibility. In a Europe of 27 members, we need to learn that environmental policy cannot be made by implementing it through the judicial system. We cannot solely rely on prosecutors and the Court of Justice to apply it. We need to rely on a common policy, and on faith in the credibility and capacity of the Member States to get going and carry out the best policies. This is why we have largely looked to good practice. Something else that is innovative about this directive is that, for the first time, it tackles climate change in relation to soil, dealing with adequate treatment of soil for floods, and for combating desertification and erosion. There is another thing that we need to take into account: Europe and its countryside are the result of the work of man; they have been produced by farmers as the gardeners of the countryside. We must take into account that the Europe of the future must be built by its citizens, and therefore, I repeat, we must set common objectives, but help them to take the path that will also ensure health and a commitment to transparency. Thank you very much, and thank you once again to the political parties.

Mr President, I am proud that in Parliament we have been able to draw up a resolution to be submitted to the next convention, which is already being held in Madrid, organised by the UN. I am proud, too, that – as I have just been informed – the Spanish Parliament has given us its permission, which is absolutely exceptional, and I thank Mr Marín, President of the Spanish Congress for this; we have a voice and we are also going to present it to the plenary sitting of the Spanish Parliament. I am, however, quite sceptical about the subject of desertification. The European Commission’s own documents show that the aid that has been given in recent years and the policy that has been undertaken has not produced the required results. Why? Because the desertification policy would require integrated systems and for all the points of view to be brought together and, unfortunately, the authorities operate separately: agriculture does not operate with the environment, water policy operates separately and, in actual fact, the desertification problems, for example the large area of land that is being abandoned, with no activity, in the case of the Mediterranean, are extraordinary. The same European agricultural policy is causing land to be abandoned in the south, and across Europe, and the CAP is going to have a significant impact on desertification. Not to mention climate change, an area, for example, in which nothing is being done about the problem of water shortage and the melting of the glaciers, which is already occurring and is going to have an absolute effect on the situation of the soil. I would therefore like to bring to the attention of the countries that rather than making observations, they should make specific policies and implement programmes, because it really is a question of integrated projects in which states have to tackle integrated policies and active policies. I think that everything is known about desertification, but very little action is being taken. This is the message that we are going to take, Europe helping with this common policy.

Madam President, the LIFE programme procedure, particularly during the final stage of the conciliation procedure, demonstrates the extent to which we are seeing a series of contradictions in Europe and how necessary Parliament still is as direct representative of the citizens. The LIFE project has always been a reference project: many NGOs, many professionals, many municipalities, have learnt what European policy is and have learnt to compete and wish to be involved in environmental policy thanks to the LIFE programme. Any people, however small it may be, is proud to obtain a LIFE project, and the same is true of the consultancies, of the officials who work on these projects and of society itself. Nevertheless, with the contradiction we are seeing now, when, on the one hand, we are ‘intergovernmental’ and, on the other, we want a European Constitution, at the end of the first reading it had been decided that the funds would be managed by governments with national agencies. Parliament was opposed because it believed that, if something is working perfectly — as in the case of LIFE — there is no need to change it. If we already have European added value, and if an image of excellence and quality has been created, why not keep it? Following a long battle, therefore, we have achieved a situation in which the money is partly allocated to the countries, but we have maintained the situation — and we have managed to persuade the Commission and subsequently the Council to agree to this proposal — in which all projects have a right to be heard and assessed by the Commission, although firstly there will be a filter of countries. I want this message to be recorded clearly in the Minutes: they all have the right to be assessed by the Commission. Finally, ‘transnational projects’ mean that, for the first time, the rivers, the water that passes from one country to another, the birds and the air itself, have been provided with an arena for work at international level.

Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Jackson not just on her good work, as it is our convention to say here, but because, on such a complex and complicated issue, I believe that she has done two things that are ideal for a good parliamentarian. On the one hand, she has listened to everybody and to all of the countries, she has listened to industry, but she has also listened to those most directly affected, and, on the other, she has tried to take a flexible and open approach, so that the Directive on waste should not become a problem but rather that it should resolve the existing problems. The previous legislation has to a large extent resolved problems, but it has also created problems that have led the Court of Justice to issue more judgments in the field of waste that in any other area. It has also created a huge problem for municipalities, which, at the end of the day, have to apply the rules, which are small, which vary hugely throughout Europe and which number many hundreds of thousands. I therefore applaud your flexibility and support you fully. I also support and welcome Amendment 112, on biodegradable waste, because we are trying to create a society in which we try to minimise the use of resources and, at the same time, take the greatest possible advantage of what we are using through recycling and recovery. Compost, that is, what in Spanish we call ‘abono
’, from waste, is one of the Earth’s most ancient forms of recycling. It is also one of the forms of waste that is essential because it is the only 'ecological' way to fertilise the soil, to enrich a soil that is poor in organic material. I am the rapporteur for the Directive on waste and I am in favour of this amendment in particular, because, until there is a specific directive, and there must be one, for biodegradable waste, until a Directive on compost is created, which for the moment is not in prospect nor part of the European Commission’s strategy — which has left it to one side in this policy of less legislation — this issue must be given a framework with a view to creating more discipline in the purification of waste and also so that farmers can use this resource with full confidence. Thank you very much and I believe that flexibility is something that we can only afford where there is viability.

Mr President, European research has gradually dedicated more room to issues relating to the environment, to people and to culture, thereby attaching more importance to their situations and to their conservation and survival. The attention paid to historical and cultural heritage is an example of this. I would like to thank those people in the Commission who have supported it. The same should be said of the inclusion of the entertainment and multimedia industry, information technologies and social sciences in the programme, as well as the innovation of introducing research relating to intelligence and the fight against terrorism. I am pleased with the agreements reached on stem cell research: we have set clear limits respecting all sensitivities, the funding of human cloning, the cloning or creation of embryos for research and their destruction has been banned, at all times under the control of regional, national and international bodies. When I speak to patients and their families, I am moved by their capacity to embrace hope. They know that it may not be they who benefit from the solutions, but they feel obliged to defend that ray of hope for new patients; I certainly will not be taking that hope away from them. Research has always been a feature of European culture; the great European researcher, Steiner, said that. Creativity and research are aspects of our identity.

Mr President, I would like warmly to congratulate Mrs Lienemann, and I am not doing so in a superficial way or because protocol requires it. I think that this Directive has achieved something important. Thanks to her extensive experience, she has an extraordinary knowledge of philosophy and of European legislative formulas and has achieved a succinct, short Directive. Despite the number of amendments, it does not have too much in it and her own amendments are very generic ideas that are typical of a framework directive. I know for a fact that she worked with experts and was open to many suggestions; amendments were not even needed in order for some of them to be incorporated. I would like to say that it is an extraordinary and wonderful thing that finally Europe is discussing the sea. Its time has come. I would, however, also like to say that this Directive should be the start of a subsequent development of legislation, as precisely because it is a framework directive, there are still many aspects that need to be developed in the future, which is what I want to talk about. For example, Amendment 27, which is practically the same as Amendment 86 tabled by my group, suggests several aspects that should be developed: among other things, activities at sea, many industrial activities, many of which are new, such as desalination, which I am not against, but it has not yet been studied, and the methodologies for studying the marine environmental impact, which are practically in their infancy, that is, they have not yet been done. I also think that the indicators should be developed more and that digital marine charts should be drawn up, which should also be used for cultural purposes. I think that one of the great treasures of world and European history are archaeological charts. This is something that needs to be developed in order to preserve our heritage and I think that it will be one of the most stimulating discoveries for all of us.
 Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines (PPE-DE

Madam President, I would like to draw attention to something that has already been said. Firstly, I believe that the European Commission’s policy is a good one, trying to harmonise aspects in a field in which it does not have any real competences, but where it can exercise leadership, and in this regard we insist that it extend its policies and carry on emphasising self-examination and pointing out the differences amongst the various countries. I am not saying that it should condemn them, but I do say that it should highlight any shortcomings. Above all, I also believe that its website should be expanded and self-examination should be introduced, for example, and a series of other possible actions taken, as is already happening in some commercial organisations. Secondly, I would like to draw attention to the family tragedy that normally accompanies cases of breast cancer. I believe that families are very frequently broken up and that many women do not dare to report their case precisely because the cancer interrupts their work rhythm, disrupts their normal lives and would prevent them from looking after their families in the event of their having to undergo surgery. I therefore believe that the European Union must broaden its action and deal also with this area of family assistance and of awareness-raising.

Mr President, there are two parts to my speech. In the first part, I shall put the oral question on Natura 2000 by Mr Florenz, who is not present and who has asked me to speak on his behalf. The question is as follows: since the Commission estimates that EUR 6.1 billion per year is needed to maintain and conserve the Natura 2000 protected areas, and since the funding is expected to come from the rural development funds, the Structural Funds, LIFE+ and the fisheries funds, how does the Commission intend to coordinate this policy? How does the Commission intend to send clear messages about its coordinated policy to users, to proprietors and to those who are in charge of Natura 2000 land. Where are the funds? What actions must be taken? How accessible is European Union protection and aid? This is something that is still not clear. Matters need to be drawn up in a very clear way so that there can be full genuine communication between the proprietors and the Commission. With regard to LIFE+, I agree with everything Mrs Isler Béguin has said. The results of the vote reflect a genuine agreement within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, though there may be discrepancies and differing positions due to the diverging views of the different States. Why? Because the new LIFE+ now being presented represents a decentralised policy and is very different to the policy in place until now. We believe that LIFE has traditionally been a leader programme for funding innovation projects and innovative management models, particularly in the field of the environment. It is a prestige programme, which NGOs have looked upon as a guide and a model. For local and regional authorities, it has become a path that must be followed, a permanent reference. We want that reference to remain. This has, however, been the case because emphasis has been placed on the universal nature of environmental policy, a factor that has been one of the reasons for the success of European policy in this field. Europe knows that environmental policy cannot just be applied to a single region. It requires a global approach. The European Union has always made this clear, and the 6th Environmental Action Programme has taken that into account at all times. Policy in the fields of climate change, desertification, water, waste, safeguarding quality of life, well-being and pollution are all of a universal nature, and that is why we want it to be applied beyond Europe and for Europe to become a model for the whole world. We should remember, however, that LIFE was created in order to bring this about, and that is stated in the text of the financial statement, which I am going to read and which states that LIFE+ credit ‘is intended to fund economic contributions for actions intended to apply, update and implement Community legislation and policy in the field of the environment, including the integration of the environment into other policies’. How can we do this if the policy is only national? How can we do this if Europe loses its leadership, if it leaves these actions in the hands of the Member States? We therefore advocate in the clearest and strongest terms a more centralised model in which Europe once again provides guidance and initiative. We understand that the Commission has a lack of resources. We are going to support it in the future, where possible, because this policy of reducing the number of officials cannot carry on. Unless Europe has a management structure and management capacities, as well as qualified personnel, it will not be able to carry out this task. With a view to its being able to do so, we undoubtedly believe that part of the management should be returned to the European Commission and that international European projects should be created, so that Europe can improve its capacities in the future, by means of ‘capacity building’, in order to ensure that projects are better monitored, to find ways to coordinate policies and to continue taking action that cuts across policy areas. That is our proposal, and we shall cooperate fully in the conciliation process so that we can reach a quick agreement, so that funding can be guaranteed and, of course, so that the Commission can do its job. That is precisely why we are here: in order to cooperate with the Commission and tell the Member States that the policy of sustainability is a process and that Europe is more than just a market.

Mr President, I would like to congratulate the European citizens and the researchers on the approval of the Buzek report on the Seventh Framework Programme. I believe that it offers hope to everybody who believes in basic research, with the creation of the European Research Council, and in the most advanced pioneering research, despite all of the risks it involves. I also believe that it offers support to small- and medium-sized businesses and also hope to everybody who depends on research in the field of health, something on which great emphasis has been placed and for which the budget in this programme has been increased, and furthermore with the support of the all of the political parties. I believe that we are in a situation of hope. We must now encourage researchers to join the project, urge the universities and the regions to join in this common task, so that we can thereby work together to benefit everybody. Furthermore, it is a much more flexible and open programme than previous ones and it has enthusiastically introduced the humanities, historical heritage and other aspects of culture. Congratulations to everybody.

Mr President, I feel less optimistic than those who have spoken so far, because I believe that the document that has been produced is essentially a document full of statements, which includes many existing clichés, many arguments that we have all heard and which are leading to an increasingly weak and less respected notion of sustainable development. Why do I say this? Because I believe that the structure in the methodology – and, as well as a politician, I am speaking as an academic – is based on an error: it is based on repeating the old clichés and on not properly analysing today’s sustainable development problems. Firstly, it does not make it clear whether the document has European or world ambitions. It does not make that clear. Secondly, it conforms to Gothenburg, but not to Johannesburg. Furthermore, it ignores problems such as the relationship between the economy and sustainable development. Today, economic activities cannot be separated from sustainability, and if we want to link it to Lisbon, even less so: in other words, there can be no employment, there can be no possibility of development for the under-developed countries, unless we take into account what kind of economy is appropriate. Certain economic activities are necessary in order to maintain biodiversity. Have we considered what economic activities are required or the role agriculture plays in maintaining animals? Have we taken account of the fact that, if we want to talk about climate change and development in Africa, we must talk about nuclear energy in order to resolve the problem of obtaining water through desalination and obtaining energy that does not pollute? If we talk about climate change, we must talk about nuclear energy as well, as a replacement for 30 or 40% of what is produced. In other words, structurally, the document is not integrated. It does not refer to the economy and it completely ignores industry. Furthermore, I do not believe that the issue of population is sufficiently dealt with. The emigrations we have from North to South in Europe are creating stress in terms of sustainable development, just like the African emigrations. That is something we must deal with, ladies and gentlemen, on the basis of sustainable development.

I would like to talk about two issues in particular; firstly, the problem of training in the place of origin. I believe that one of Europe’s problems is that we have not drawn up any strategy on the policy of aid relating to health, and in particular training. On the one hand, I believe that we in Europe have been implementing a very self-centred policy of numerus clausus
 in the majority of universities and nursing schools, in order to guarantee employment for our students, without taking account of the fact that the prospects and needs of Europe were going to exceed our capacity to provide care; that is why doctors and nurses from other countries are needed. This is clearly leading to the drain that is being talked about so often today. At the same time, however, I believe that, in the development aid strategy, universities should be created alongside hospitals. The investment policy must not be restricted to roads, but must also consider hospitals and human resources training. Furthermore, there must be a specific programme which offers results. Furthermore, there is one issue that is of great concern to me, because I have seen it first-hand: the difficulties in the distribution of medicines and the corruption that exists in their distribution. We are aware of the difficulties faced by hospitals on the ground, in Cameroon and in other countries, in carrying their work and accessing medicines, and that frequently the people distributing medicines for combating AIDS, which are being sent free of charge, are adding additional costs to them. Within this context, I believe that, in its programmes, Europe must allocate more money to training, but at the same time control the distribution of aid much more effectively and prevent that corruption, which is a permanent obstacle, thereby putting to an end to the frustration of the people treating the sick.

Mr President, I would like warmly to thank Commissioner McCreevy and the members of my group, Mr Harbour, Mrs Thyssen and others, who have been fighting to defend a directive and who have had to watch what we considered to be the best aspects of it disappearing before their very eyes. I must say that we politicians and people in power sometimes fall behind society, and I say this because there are two aspects of the directive that are of great interest to me and that are unfortunately not going to be taken up to a great extent: on the one hand, the recognition of qualifications and freedom to work for skilled people and, on the other, the issue of health. I believe that in Europe, when people go to another country to work, it is much easier for them to work in manual jobs, in under-recognised jobs, even if they are highly qualified, because corporate egotism does not allow anything else. We have not been able to remove this obstacle. I would like to talk, secondly, about health. The directive included the facility or obligation to return funds to those residents of one country who receive medical assistance in another. The Mediterranean is packed with millions of Europeans who have gone South in search of sun and a new life, but their right to reimbursement of the funds relating to the social services – and, in particular, health services - they receive is not recognised. They are in a situation of uncertainty and they are in a difficult situation, but, above all, they have been abandoned by the politicians. And I would say the same with regard to private medicine. I therefore support the inclusion of private medicine, because we have hundreds of clinics that are treating and assisting the Germans, the British and the Swedes who are in the South and in the Mediterranean. These citizens have the right to speak in their own languages, to be treated in their own languages and to have services provided in their own languages. This situation exists; society has created it, and we do not want to recognise it.

Mr President, I would like to express my agreement with Mrs Korhola; I really cannot agree with Amendments 22, 23 and 25. I believe that the Århus Convention, which is already being transposed in some countries, such as Spain, is clearly a victory for the possibility of transparency, training and so forth. Nevertheless, I am extremely worried that positions that move away from the common sense demonstrated by the Council and from the Commission's position intend to give non-governmental organisations excessive legal capacity, in my view, as Mrs Korhola has said. I believe that democracy must be symmetrical. It is not logical that non-governmental organisations should have more rights than local councils in this field. Neither do I believe that regions can have a particular capacity which we here would give them. Furthermore, there is a principle in law, that of direct interest, which has been the subject of much debate in legal history and which is normally applied to the family or to certain problems that occur in the territory in question. Nevertheless, I believe that applying direct interest to any NGO in Europe would take us into the realm of infinite law, and we would have no idea where that would end. I believe that this may create a huge number of problems, above all because, as we know, sustainable development requires knowledge of the direct resource, because not every case is the same. The main principle, which we have raised here many times, is that the concept of sustainable development is integral, it must relate to a specific place, and in one place certain things can be done for economic and social reasons which cannot be done in another place. The idea, therefore, that certain NGOs, often not located in the relevant place, can demand this right by virtue of their interest in the environment, seems to me to be excessive. I therefore agree with the Council’s position.

Mr President, I would like to point out that the ten years of effort it has taken to draw up this document have been ten years of constant agreement and cooperation. This demonstrates how effective European Union policy can be, because, from the outset, local councils, local authorities and the States began to work to improve the condition of beaches and bathing waters, both inland and on the coast. I believe that it is important to stress – whenever I am teaching in the future, I shall explain this to my students – that this is a genuine example of the extent to which environmental policy is an added value for the economic system, for the wellbeing of the citizens and also in terms of increased land values. A beach with clean water is a welcoming and high-quality tourist area. If it is not clean, we know that the public will not go and will become increasingly conditioned. This is the result of a policy of cooperation and of a mutual effort. I therefore believe it to be satisfactory and furthermore the introduction of the category of ‘sufficient’ for water seems to me to be very realistic, because we must remain within the bounds of reality. Ensuring that waters are clean costs an enormous amount of money and takes an enormous amount of management effort, many sanctions for dumping along river banks and an integrated policy. We politicians must be aware that that effort comes from the citizens’ pockets and from a very significant scientific policy for controlling dumping, and that it is not easy to achieve all of this. I am therefore pleased and I would point out that this demonstrates the extent to which the quality of the environment adds value to the economic system, to industries and also to social welfare.

Mr President, the proposal is that the following be added at the end of Amendment 356: ‘highly-diffused inorganic substances or substances on which there is sufficient risk information, such as sodium chloride, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium oxide, gold, silver, aluminium, magnesium, silicates, glasses and ceramic frits’. In other words, it concerns substances on which information is already available.

Madam President, it is clear that climate change is so intense and so close to us that it is no longer an intellectual problem or a problem affecting certain more sensitive groups which had raised the issue. This is an opportunity to change our habits and customs, it is an opportunity to reduce emissions and to create cleaner air, it is an opportunity to develop renewable and alternative energy sources and it is also an opportunity for Europe to look at its dependence on fossil fuels, often in areas with great political instability and subject to dramatic price fluctuations. I therefore believe that it also opens up the opportunity to look again at nuclear energy as one of the many solutions, in addition to other alternatives. We must still greatly improve research into and knowledge of the causes of climate change. For example, very little research has been done on the relationship between agriculture and climate change. Recent research has raised an alarm and opened up another direction; we are only blaming industry for the problem. I believe that we should create an intelligent form of agriculture which is geared towards those strategies; that would be much safer from a scientific point of view. Furthermore, I believe that we must also make improvements in relation to quotas, the mathematical models for setting quotas; there are still many countries that are not doing so correctly, while others have found good solutions, such as the British. I also believe that we must seek strategies for compensating for climate change and determining the extent to which it can be alleviated. I believe that we must review our policy on drought and desertification in the Mediterranean and deal with the suffering and deterioration of the eco-system and of our animal resources and fauna.

Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Sacconi, the coordinators and the rapporteurs for the immense efforts they have made, but also the whole of the technical team and the officials, all of whom have allowed us to reach an agreement on such a complex issue. This is a sign that politics works and that this Parliament works when it comes to a truly important task. We are dealing with a complex document, not just because it encompasses a huge number of policies, but because, furthermore — and this is what I am going to argue here — it is an open document. I believe that the issue is being dealt with as if the whole policy of chemical products ended with REACH; nevertheless, the policy on chemical products, if it is intended to promote the health and wellbeing of the citizens, must complement other Union policies and other policies of the countries and, therefore, we cannot take the view that everything begins and ends with REACH. And I believe that it will be the ideal instrument for producing consensus policies. What are the advantages of REACH? I believe that it has created the basis for a common European policy in the chemical field and has been a victory for coordination and common policy in the field. Secondly, it has created an Agency which is being given authority, competences, responsibility and the capacity to coordinate, which I believe is an extraordinary victory for the citizens. Thirdly, REACH is entirely founded upon the recognition of science and the value of science and of studies, which guarantees objectivity for the future and also opens the doors to information for citizens and companies. I believe that that is the other important point we have to be pleased about. Furthermore — and I would like to end here — I believe that it is absurd to believe that the responsibility for the health policy must fall entirely to companies; companies are being blamed for everything that happens in the world of health and chemical products. I believe that, in this case, they are being given greater responsibility than before and they are being obliged to carry out studies, but the health policy with regard to new chemical products can only be implemented if we combine good research by the States and good health research and if the Agency emerges, with a group of experts, as a receptacle for the information which has to be communicated to the industries.

Mr President, before commenting on the characteristics of this project, I would like to express my thanks not just to Mrs Isler Béguin, but also to Mrs Lienemann, the other shadow rapporteurs and the officials and advisors who are working extremely hard to reach a consensus on this project. We have achieved extraordinary consensus in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety: everybody has introduced their points of view and, although there are apparently not many amendments, a new spirit has been introduced and the LIFE programme has been enriched, in cooperation with the Commission. How has it been enriched? In my opinion, we have introduced several new aspects. Firstly, this project has placed great emphasis on the management of natural resources. It is also of great educational importance in terms of teaching how to govern and manage the environment. Furthermore, we have insisted on an institutional presence in the form of the municipalities and regions as local authorities that have to re-evaluate their resources. In this regard, I would also like to stress another element: the introduction of landscapes deserving of respect that have not been integrated into the Natura 2000 list, such as certain rivers, but which may be important shared spaces. There is another innovation: the concept has been introduced, and the idea strengthened, of international projects and cross-border projects. Why? Because natural spaces are usually in border zones and in mountainous areas. Rivers are a clear case in point: the logical thing would be to create a LIFE for rivers one day, because rivers cross many countries. Furthermore, I must say something else: we have created a market spirit for Natura 2000. We believe that, in this case, we must imitate United States policy by creating banks for wetlands and banks for natural areas, so that the Member States can compensate proprietors, creating, shall we say, an area of exchange of ownership for the Natura 2000 zone. In this way, the companies and many others who also have to take initiatives on the ground may contribute economically to compensating, by means of the ‘polluter pays’ principle, for their passage through those protected territories. They may do so through active and positive policies for the conservation of the natural environment, funded by private bodies and by institutions. This is therefore not just another LIFE programme; it is a project based on a consensus which I believe has been guided by great common sense; I therefore congratulate everybody.

Mr President, this document is worthy of praise and I believe that it is appropriate that technologies relating to the environment should be supported. Nevertheless, I would have liked rather more specific details because, so far, the environment is being identified with just two or three aspects of what we may call sustainable development — I am referring to climate change or the view that environmental technologies are those that improve the industrial processes for preventing emissions. Nevertheless, I believe that there are many other extremely important environmental technologies that are not integrated in a systematic manner and that are not treated in the same way within the European Union's research projects: examples are conservation of existing resources and combating disasters. I am talking about extremely important aspects, such as the fight against the problem of forest fires, the fight to maintain our heritage and the fight to maintain nature. But there is something else that I believe must be raised at this time. If Europe is to behave consistently, both with itself and with its projects, we must consider developing a line within environmental and sustainable development technologies dedicated to water and to the administration of the most scant resources. Specifically, we must make an effort in relation to all technologies that can be applied in Africa. We are talking about the fight against poverty. In Johannesburg, many people criticised the fact that the importance of all technologies dedicated to the supply of water were being emphasised, on the grounds that it would lead to the development of large multinationals. That is not the problem: we must provide the parts of the world living in poverty with instruments for conserving water and conserving the environment. That is what I am calling for on this significant date.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that we are all aware of the same problem and that we all know that this is not a problem for political parties but a problem at state level for each of our countries. It is a European problem, the tackling of which has, for many years, been postponed when dealing with overall policy. I think it is very important to bear in mind that drought is a disaster which, moreover, also afflicts areas least able to be defended against water shortages or bouts of frost. My fellow MEPs have already talked about the tragedy of losing more than EUR 2 000 million. For myself, I should like, however, also to talk about the human factor. I walk every weekend through my own region and know what it is to see black trees that will never grow again. I know the nature of a people like that of the Mediterranean region in which those with substantial farms, in many cases on the verge of retiring from farming with no one to take over from them, also think that the trees being planted will take more than six years to grow. As a result of this disaster, much of the land will go uncultivated and will be liable to end up as mere desert. Let us not forget – and this is an important factor – that, in the future impact assessment, due weight will need to be given to the fact that it is, for example, the very olive groves and almond trees that are key factors in preventing desertification and preserving the scarce rain in our soil. Nor must we forget that livestock are dying of thirst. The other day, a shepherd told me, ‘twenty-five per cent of my livestock will be going to the slaughterhouse this year. I cannot keep so much livestock. I have no water. The animals are thirsty’. I want to say something more. The Natura 2000 network, about which Europe is so concerned, is in danger because the wetlands are without water. Those of us who live at this Mediterranean latitude in Murcia, Valencia or Andalusia know perfectly well that the birds are already no longer heard in the mornings because they have gone to places where they can drink. Even if householders put water out for them to drink, that is not enough because they lack not only drink but also food. That much is obvious, and Europe will need to include the fact among the variables it will have to study. There is a series of measures proposed by the European Union. I am grateful for what you said, Commissioner, about forestry aid, but let us bear in mind that the summer has not yet begun. The Mediterranean climate, pitiless as it is, is really going to put us through it because our situation is already critical. It is May, and it has not rained. I am also grateful for the idea of a pilot study, but I would point out that such a pilot study will have to be comprehensive. Not only has my government acted belatedly, but it has taken measures that will exacerbate the situation. Why? Specifically because, four years ago, this Commission was presented with a National Hydrological Plan whereby water would be carried to these regions, indeed to the whole of the agricultural area. The European Commission delayed accepting the plan, the subject became politicised and, in the end, the Spanish Government kept the water where it was. Water is what, moreover, would have enabled the wetlands to thrive. It would have created a degree of hope and enabled the trees planted to replace those seriously affected by the frost or drought to grow again. We now face bleak prospects, a plan having been shelved for entirely political reasons.

Mr President, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats very much welcome this Directive. Nevertheless, from the outset, we found ourselves, at least in certain sectors within my group and certain countries, in a particularly uncomfortable situation, because the directive did not fulfil all the objectives we had hoped for. For example, it did not deal with one fundamental issue relating to the control of aquifers — quantity — and focussed solely on quality, although, in reality, the water directive, in its respective annexes, talked about controlling quantities — volumes of water — and controlling quality at the same time. The failure to link quality and quantity in a government measure, a management measure, is something we cannot understand. Furthermore, there is no insistence on the need for control either on the part of the Member States or on the part of river basins, which is what the water Directive lays down for the management of water; it does not provide for control by means of river basins but rather by means of countries. Furthermore, the artificial refilling of aquifers is not considered either, despite the fact that this is an essential phenomenon. Finally, we must point out that we believe that many of Parliament’s amendments make the situation worse, because they are intended to standardise all aquifers and all controls of substances, although we are well aware that European geology is very diverse and that the concept of Europe's geological diversity must be a fundamental consideration of this policy, because sustainable development must be appropriate for each location. Furthermore, we believe that some of the amendments would be impossible to implement, such as Amendment 94, because a State cannot guarantee what enters its aquifers, since in many cases they are shared. If Amendment 94 is approved, therefore, we are going to vote against the directive because it would be incomplete and would not provide for control of quantities of water.

It is surprising that the European Union has yet to draw up and implement a short- and long-term strategy to combat drought and desertification, since, in the countries of the south and the Mediterranean, this is one of the main threats to economic and social sustainability. The lack of a joint plan between the countries and the Commission (Agriculture and Environment) is, however, all the more striking given that the European Environment Agency has recently stressed that the areas that will suffer most from the negative affects of the expected climate change are the Mediterranean countries. We therefore support a policy to combat drought in Portugal and any assistance to alleviate the impact of this water shortage on productivity, the market and cultivation itself. Furthermore, we are asking that it be extended to other countries of the south.

Mr President, I am sorry to say that, despite all Mrs Auken's efforts to improve the document, we are not doing well. I say this because I have never seen an initiative like Natura 2000 which has been backed by all MEPs and political groups and yet generated so much confusion, and in many cases, conflicting positions. Why is this? Because the document itself is poor. It is a document born of good intentions, but technically speaking it is incomplete and muddled. Firstly, because it fails to distinguish between the different categories covered by Natura 2000: for example, between forests and agricultural land – the vast majority – where the land is farmed or a protected natural environment, as opposed to rivers, the sea and the sea bed. It would be folly to envisage applying rural development to the sea bed. How would it be funded? The same problem arises in the case of rivers and wetlands. The different categories are not clearly defined, nor is the subject of funding dealt with clearly. For example, we see that the Structural Funds rules would need to be changed in order to finance Natura 2000, but the Structural Funds are based on statistics rather than qualitative terms, as is the case with Natura 2000. At the same time, when funding rural development, there should be an initial awareness-raising campaign because, in reality, environmental concerns and agriculture are relatively incompatible, and because the policy underlying Natura 2000 caused many landowners to lose land or have their activities curtailed. In addition, there has been no work to assess the extent to which rural development contains environmental elements that could be used to get farmers enthused about future landscape conservation and environmental projects. Unfortunately, as a result, this document has not been returned to the Committee, despite the importance of the subject to this Parliament and the good faith currently being demonstrated by its actions. In my view, both Parliament and biodiversity deserve a better document.

Mr President, we are all pleased that the Commission has dealt with the issues of the Natura 2000 Network, which relates to the LIFE Programme, for which I am shadow rapporteur. Nevertheless, I believe we are finding the situation very frustrating because the issue has been dealt with without taking account of the concepts which are essential to sustainability and, furthermore, we have made the old mistake of seeing Natura 2000 as a crystallised territory, with no life or activity. Since the first declaration of protected areas, Natura 2000, rather than bringing society pleasure, has become a problem. Nowhere wants to be declared a protected area, because there is no parallel support policy. It has become a constant battle. There has been no education about the exploitation of natural resources, nor of the true added value of the Natura Network, which generates and awakens enthusiasm. Furthermore, there has been hidden expropriation, since the use of land is much more restricted than before and, in many cases, the value of the land is reduced. It has therefore become a burden. So what is the problem with the document we are dealing with? Firstly, it does not recognise typologies. We cannot introduce the concept of Natura 2000 without looking at the great families of biodiversity, because each of them requires a different financial instrument. For example, how are the marine funds, which do not appear, to be managed by means of rural development? A separate Natura will have to be created. Neither are rivers treated as significant, while I believe they should be treated as an essential project. Neither is there any proper distinction between the different forest areas. There should at least have been an indication of an intention to produce a diversified policy. Finally, I would like to say that, if we did not introduce Natura into the market economy, we will not have achieved anything, because nature means life, economy and sustainability.

Mr President, I believe that nobody has done more than the European Commission to combat climate change and to raise awareness of it throughout the world. However, I also believe that, while it can enjoy the responsibility and glory of having been the body that raised the problem, this must be accompanied by great scientific efforts in order to ensure that words become realities. We have to move on from a Europe of fine words to a more efficient and scientific Europe. In this regard, I believe that, having held meetings successively in Kyoto and in other places, it is necessary, and I believe urgent, to carry out thorough work with regard to climate change. We have carried out in-depth studies into what is causing the harm but not into what is of benefit. To this end, I would like one of the proposals of this term in office to be to go further into the relationship between agriculture and the environment. Within agriculture, I include reforestation. For example, if a hectare of orange trees produces 40 000 kilos per year or four tonnes of plant material, is that beneficial in terms of climate change or not? What, for example, is Mediterranean agriculture providing in terms of climate change? This confrontation between agriculture and the environment must come to an end, and one of the ways to achieve this is to see the benefits of agriculture in terms of the carbon sinks it produces, and also to see what kind of reforestation is the most appropriate and what is best for the environment. In this way, we can establish positive policies to bring all activities together, not just industry, but also agriculture. In this respect, I believe we are a long way behind. For the same reason, if, as stated in the recent report, Spain, Greece and the Mediterranean are the regions which are most going to feel the impact of climate change, I believe it is the Commission’s responsibility to produce studies and propose solutions.

Mr President, I want to talk about climate change, but above all about the report of the European Environment Agency, which two months ago published a prognosis for the future and points out that the areas at greatest risk, the areas which are going to suffer most as a result of climate change, are the Mediterranean areas. I believe it is very serious that this has not so far been said out loud. I believe it is essential to insist that the Mediterranean areas are going to suffer most from the increase in temperature, with the extremely serious risks to health that entails; they are going to suffer most from lack of water, from lack of rainfall; from an increase in desertification, from the advance of the desert; from a decrease in productivity. Furthermore, these areas are receiving immigration based on suffering, misery and hunger. It is our duty to help them. I would call on Europe to opt clearly for strategies to combat desertification and a policy for adapting to climate change, as recommended by the Agency. We must produce adaptable policies, as required by sustainable development. We need integrated strategies and much more in-depth studies and research into the problems we are facing. The United Nations Organisation, which has implemented a process of combating the desertification of Europe, has said almost nothing. I am therefore calling for a Mediterranean policy, a policy fundamentally of social balance and a more active policy for the future.

Mr President, I am well aware that Mrs Wallström knows she has given us a political reply with data and statistics, and she is perfectly aware that, today, European Union aid in the field of forest fires simply consists of money allocated in an arbitrary manner. There is no complex strategy, though it is a complex interdisciplinary problem requiring cooperation amongst institutions. It is the job, moreover, of us politicians to solve complex and difficult problems. To this end, I believe we must create a model for the management of risks, for management and cooperation, because we are faced with issues ranging from judicial procedures, because there is a lot of terrorism, to the issues of policing, the civil population and the local authorities. We must create models, as was done for Agenda 21. The European Union is capable of doing this. Above all, I am concerned, however, about the need for shared effective technological development, because, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the European Commission must do what the countries or the regions cannot do. The problem of technological development is extremely important, in terms, for example, of the transfer of military technology, the development of the GIS and many other things that are being applied in some regions very successfully and which require technology shared amongst the 25 countries, amongst all the regions and amongst all the local authorities, because it is clear that, without that technological progress, all we can hope for is human effort and a lot of good will, but little success.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, we are again at a complex moment for the European Union, facing a difficult economic situation, and we are starting to draw up the outlines of economic policy in circumstances which are essentially characterised by a weakening of economic growth which itself is basically a response to a lack of confidence on the part of economic agents: consumers, entrepreneurs and, above all, small and medium-sized undertakings. Accordingly, in addition to congratulating the rapporteur, in addition also to expressing our satisfaction for the positive attitude of the other Groups, especially the Socialist Group, with whom we have reached broad agreement allowing economic policy outlines to be drawn up, my political Group, the Group of the European People’s Party, wishes to stress the appropriateness of strengthening the European Union, and strengthening the European economy by advocating and committing ourselves to economic reforms. To that end we support the Commission in its efforts to use the Integrated Guidelines to facilitate fundamental reforms to underpin a new framework of confidence to enable the difficulties we are facing to be overcome. A new framework dedicated to labour reforms agreed with social partners, tax reforms which encourage growth of small and medium undertakings and job creation. In short, a framework dedicated to reforms which facilitate the completion of the internal market as the best way of stimulating economic growth as a job creator in the European Union. In that regard I would also like to stress that protectionism must be rejected, a point we defend in our policy position, and advocate in short for us to finally lay the foundations in the European Union for economic growth which creates employment, which is the true pillar of European integration.

 Madam President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, globalisation is good for Europe; Europe must encourage globalisation. We are witnessing an as-yet slow but irreversible dissolution of frontiers in the world, a process which has succeeded in lifting more than 400 million people out of poverty in less than twenty years and for the first time, in 2007, China will be the country, the area of the world, which will contribute most to the growth of the world economy, China, not the European Union, ladies and gentlemen! This means in short that globalisation is a challenge but also a great opportunity. It is a challenge in the sense that opening-up means more growth, more welfare and more employment, and this is something we must explain to European citizens. What concerns me again is hearing the word ‘protect’ in this Chamber. Protectionism is a denial of globalisation and a denial of the European Union. Protecting citizens is not necessary when they are the protagonists of their own economic growth and their own well-being. We must hand that ability back to the people and we must therefore also conduct an exercise in self-criticism in the European Union. This is because we in the European Union are not doing what we must when our growth is inadequate, when we also have our share of responsibility for the crisis in world financial markets and, in short, when we do not do everything we must at home, on our own doorstep, to foster economic growth among small and medium-sized enterprises and create more employment, because we need much more employment than the process of opening up the economy will be able to provide. The Lisbon Agenda is really a marker: achieving the internal market, putting public finances in order, reforming, modernising our labour market, committing ourselves to environmental reform, renewable energy and in short opening Europe up really means greater social cohesion in Europe.

Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has put forward an opinion, which was adopted unanimously – there were no votes against – in which, firstly, we celebrate the advances in appropriations aimed at improving competitiveness for economic growth and employment, and also, especially, those aimed at cohesion for growth and employment within the European Union. With regard to the matters that the Committee is responsible for, economic and monetary affairs, the field of enterprise, competition, taxation and customs union, the fight against tax fraud and general fraud in European statistics and, in particular, the chapter on statistics, we do of course welcome the budgetary advances, the budgetary approach, but of course we have also, found inadequacies. We would have liked more money, more money used for economic growth, in other words more money for the well-being of citizens, to provide clearer support for monetary union programmes, to provide clearer support for small and medium-sized enterprises as a source of job creation. Of course, we all need to be guided by the principles of austerity – this should come first and no one says so more than myself. However, this and the current shortcomings in our Union budgets are poles apart. We believe that the European Union should really have to make more incisive budgets in terms of stimulating economic growth that will create employment, and for this purpose allocating resources that belong to all the EU countries is absolutely necessary.

At the same time, however, I would also like to bring as much realism as possible to this debate, as concealing the seriousness of the facts will only lead to confusion when it comes to seeking solutions. Firstly, we are facing a crisis that was predicted. We are not facing a surprise crisis. It was known that this would happen at least one year before, and there has been a lack of care, a lack of capacity to react. Secondly, we are facing a serious crisis. The President of the Bundesbank
 said so himself just over three days ago. We may be on the verge of a classic banking crisis of withdrawal of confidence. Thirdly, Europe has been infected by financial institutions in countries that have been unable to make profits because their economies were relatively stagnant, and have therefore sought profit at a greater risk. It could therefore be said that the supervisory authorities, the European prudential authorities, have failed to prevent this from happening. The European Central Bank is therefore the first to intervene in the crisis, the one that is injecting the most money, precisely because it is in Europe, in the heart of Europe, which is now recovering economically, where this crisis could become most serious. We therefore need more clarity as to what the actual repercussions are and how major this crisis really is. Undoubtedly the fourth characteristic of what we are experiencing, the circumstances that we are in, is, in short, the reaction of our monetary authorities, the reaction of the European Central Bank. In my opinion, it acted correctly when it made these injections of liquidity, because what we are seeing is a withdrawal of liquidity. However, it is also true that it is paradoxical that this should happen precisely when Europe is raising interest rates in order to restrict the liquidity of the system, to restrict credit. This is a major paradox that needs to be explained properly, without the confusion that arose from the explanations given throughout August. Clarification is essential, because we are talking about millions of families and millions of small and medium-sized enterprises, which depend on variable interest rates in Europe, getting into debt. Therefore, it is essential that we clarify the interest rate scenario and ask for caution in interest rate rises in Europe, in order to strengthen the economic growth and job creation that we need so much at this stage of EU integration.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Trichet, Mr Juncker, I should first like to congratulate Mr Rosati and, in particular, Mr Mitchell, on the quality of their reports. I believe that, economically speaking, these are promising times for Europe. Our objective is to increase production and economic activity. This is being reflected in new employment opportunities, and with inflation kept under control. The challenge right now is to consolidate this economic growth, a goal we will not achieve unless our institutional problems are resolved. The issue in the reports is whether what we are witnessing is a cyclical recovery or a more substantial economic movement. In this context, we do not have to resign ourselves to the idea that Europe has potential growth of 2%. The Member States must from now on synchronise their growth rates. In short, more jobs and more SMEs need to be created. On this issue, the European Central Bank must also pursue the recommendations contained in Mr Mitchell’s report, namely prudence when it comes to raising interest rates, because decisions that should rest with governments, decisions on reform and much more far-reaching decisions in the fight against protectionism should not be pre-empted. The major problem we face in Europe is the rhetoric of protectionism, which goes against the spirit of European integration. To sum up, this is a positive economic time, which, among other things, must be used to ensure that this growth continues and that European citizens are encouraged to identify the euro as one of their sources of well-being, prosperity and, most importantly, fresh job opportunities.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President of the European Investment Bank, the report we are debating today falls within the framework of dialogue between two European institutions. This dialogue is producing positive results, as demonstrated by the presence of the European Parliament, in a spirit of cooperation and appreciation of the important work of the European Investment Bank. We have been working on this report for months. We began on 20 June of last year and that work also involved our visit to the headquarters of the EIB in September. Also fruitful has been the work we have carried out with the various political groups, with all of those that have tabled amendments. We reached an agreement on the inclusion of those amendments with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, with the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, with the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and with the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. I would like publicly to thank those groups for their willingness to cooperate. This made it possible for the draft report to be approved unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 23 January. The EIB is doing a good job, and we take a positive view of it, within the context of a year like 2005, when the European economy was relatively stagnant and we had the sense that the structural component of our economy, its growth potential, was, in relative and comparative terms, lower than that of the other developed regions of the world. This is an important approach to take when assessing the EIB’s economic actions. Those actions, ultimately aimed at enhancing the European Union’s physical resources in the form of infrastructures, make it possible to improve the Union’s growth potential. The new approach, which has been present in the EIB’s activities since 2005, geared towards small and medium-sized businesses – which unquestionably form the European Union’s backbone – is another positive approach, which we welcome and which will be implemented accordingly. We believe that the main focuses of its action, that is to say, to promote the European Union’s economic and social cohesion, the Innovation 2010 initiative, the protection of the environment, the development of the trans-European networks and the contribution to the European external cooperation and development aid policy, have been carried out in a satisfactory manner. In the report we introduce a first suggestion, which is to question whether the EIB has sufficient resources to implement such ambitious policies. As a public Bank, the EIB is comparatively small when compared to the public Banks of the countries making up the European Union. With regard to the principal objectives, we advise the EIB to continue working particularly in the least-developed regions, with a view to promoting ‘catching up’. We also recommend that it focus its investment efforts on those less developed regions, on projects relating to innovation and the knowledge-based society. Our report also emphasises – of course – energy, the energy components, improving the security of supply and the freedom of the market. The EIB can contribute here as well. Also with regard to the funding of the trans-European networks, which are absolutely crucial — as I said earlier — to the structured development of the European economy. Furthermore, with regard to foreign policy, we appeal to the EIB since we believe that the volume of loans granted to Latin America is insufficient, compared to external activities in other regions of the world. With regard to the methods for intervention, we welcome the intensification of cooperation with the Commission on programmes that are already underway. We are pleased with the volume of resources allotted to small and medium-sized businesses, and we would insist that this is a fundamental aspect that we must continue to improve in the future. We must also stress the improvement in access to information and the transparency of operation, which the Bank is clearly improving. The report contains a positive assessment in this regard and also encourages the bank to continue with that transparency, genuinely subjecting its accounts to the Basel II criteria and, through better communication of its work, to provide its users with better information, beginning with the European Union’s financial intermediaries.

We are dealing with a good report. I believe that Mr Bullmann has done an excellent job, an open job, in order to produce an analysis of the European economy at this time. It is a hopeful time, but it is also a time for realistic analysis. This report also stresses that we must make a precise diagnosis of whether we are dealing with a strictly cyclical recovery or something more. I hope that it is something more, but we must also tell the European citizens that we must carry on working because the rationalisation of public finances we saw last year may also be due to cyclical factors and not to deliberate or structural decisions. As the report does, we must accept that what has failed in the European economy over recent years has been the weakness of internal demand, that is to say, confidence, consumer and investor confidence, and that is extremely negative in terms of the European project. We must also stress the need for reforms: reforms of the labour market that have been discussed and agreed; reforms of economic policies to promote small and medium-sized businesses, which are key to the growth and creation of employment; reforms intended to complete the single market, particularly in services and in the energy sector; reforms to improve the efficiency of the markets in goods, services, work and capital; and also fiscal reforms aimed at providing a coordinated fiscal framework that stimulates the creation of jobs and promotes the creation and development of the fabric of small and medium-sized enterprise that we believe to be fundamental. Furthermore, this report stresses the need to combat protectionism, which unfortunately is present in many of our current European governments, and we also warn that the risk associated with the euro-dollar exchange rate may threaten the quality of our economic growth.

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, the Lisbon Strategy represents the launch of a great European project, now that we have achieved the euro, aimed at achieving greater well-being and especially levels of employment and participation by Europeans in the workplace, women in particular. It is an ambitious project for 2010. It sets the path towards opening up — opening up Europe — a path towards liberalising strategic sectors, communications, transport, energy, financial services. Also towards modernising labour relations, with a view to ensuring, by means of social agreements, that the labour market is modernised in such a way as to increase access to jobs, especially for young people and for the long-term unemployed. We are now seeing a recovery of economic growth and this Summit, to be held in March, which will revise that Lisbon Strategy, must confirm to the Europeans that economic growth in 2006 is not a passing event, but that it can be reinforced within the framework of the global economy and of that recovery. In order to do that, we are going to need a lot of political initiative, a lot of political capacity in order to carry out the reforms that cannot be left any longer – and this afternoon energy and the environment have been mentioned in this House. In short, all of the reforms needed to restore the Europeans’ confidence in their own project. There will be no confidence without employment. What is slowing down the great European Project is our inability to grow, as Mrs Wallström said. It is low growth with insufficient job creation. Those of us who feel profoundly European believe that there is still time to restore that process and not to let it die by itself.

 Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Rosati, because I think he has produced an excellent report, which takes on board contributions from the other political groups. In my speech tonight, I should like to focus on the relationship between public deficit and economic growth. The Commissioner has provided us with more up-to-date information. Despite that, I would dare to regard the European Union public deficit situation as worrying: 2.4% on average is better than 2.9%, but it is still worrying. The fact is that the European Union – Europe – is the region of the world, including the less developed parts of the world, that is achieving least growth at a time of international economic expansion. Thus Europe is not keeping its own house in order and it is not doing what it ought to be doing in terms of balancing the international economy. That has a great deal to do with the public deficit situation, as other speakers this evening, such as Mr Karas and Mr Hoppenstedt, have pointed out; they have said that, in a European economy afflicted with a lack of domestic demand, public deficits are a cause and not an effect. Therefore, I have to insist that we must improve the European Union’s mechanisms in order to improve confidence and, in the last analysis, so that income levels in the European Union grow. It has the ability to do so, but its problem is that its growth potential is so terribly low, incomparably low. We are the area of the world with least growth potential, and that is where the problem lies. That can be solved, in effect, through structural reforms and also, of course, through public finances that have been straightened out by means of political willpower to contain public spending to the point where it becomes sustainable, so that European citizens can pay reasonable, modern taxes.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like firstly to thank the rapporteur for her work, which has been really excellent, and congratulate her, as well as the coordinators who have acted as shadow rapporteurs for the main groups. I am not going to repeat the arguments that have been expressed here, with which I fully agree. It is clear that we need more innovation in Europe; it is very clear the SMEs are the protagonists; it is even clearer that we are in favour of free competition; it is also very clear that State aid is an exceptional instrument. Nevertheless — and this is what I would like to add — State aid is also effective; it is effective in many cases, in order to create employment, in order to create well-being for great numbers of European citizens. I therefore believe that, when we talk about who the potential beneficiaries of that State aid are, we must look towards the least-favoured regions; we must look towards those who, as a result of an insufficient financial perspective, are going to have less European aid for their development. In this field, I would also like to insist to the Commissioner on the need for innovation not to be an excuse for cutting aid to those who, as Europeans, have every right to share in the benefits of economic growth, because that is how we create Europe, by granting aid that genuinely promotes the territorial cohesion of Europe and equal opportunities for all Europeans.

Mr President, Commissioner, we are holding this debate this afternoon in the context of extremely serious events in the energy markets, essentially in electricity and gas. We are seeing takeover bids led by governments − as in Spain – or prevented by governments – as in France. This is all the wrong way round, and is contrary to the spirit of the European Union. We are hearing political arguments from top politicians of important European countries who have no hesitation in questioning the fundamental principles of the European Union: the free movement of capital and full competition in the markets. These include arguments such as those we have heard over recent days from Ministers who appear to be talking about planning: the most antiquated and failed form of economic planning. They are quite happy to talk about protectionism, about economic patriotism, about nationalism; in short, they are using the worst kinds of populist argument. In light of this, we must commit ourselves fully to European construction, which means the free integration of markets, acknowledging that there are asymmetries in those markets. Of course there are asymmetries! We have hardly seen a single example of economic integration in which there have not been asymmetries. But despite that, here we are, we have come this far, and these political positions simply add more problems and difficulties to the problems and difficulties we have already had to face. We are talking about strategic sectors, but equally strategic are communications, transport and finance. Faced with these nationalist temptations, we would call upon the Commission to prioritise the objective and ideal of European integration and, in the face of this populist and isolationist attitude, to dedicate itself to the objective of creating a single market. In short, we are calling upon the Commission to do its duty as guardian of the Treaties and to promote real development and employment policies for all of the European citizens. (Applause from the right)

Madam President, Commissioner, the necessary institutional respect and caution does not prevent us from making political assessments of the decisions of the institutions, as in the case of the European Central Bank, whose interest rate rise, at a time of low economic growth and lack of job creation in the European Union, is rather worrying for millions of Spaniards, millions of European citizens, millions of small businesses throughout Europe and millions of families with mortgages. That is why I said, Commissioner, that I would urge the Commission also to make a respectful political proposal to the European Central Bank.

Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, this report is very timely at this point, since the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral bodies have been with us for some years now, with the task of regulating the conditions of the world economy. I believe that this is a story of success. A relative success, like all successes, ladies and gentlemen, but a success nonetheless, in relation too to the functioning of the International Monetary Fund, which has now put the kind of world crises that we have experienced during the history of the developed countries and in the developing countries behind us. The emphasis placed by the International Monetary Fund on macroeconomic stability is fundamental in order to promote equal opportunities for economic development for everybody. Today we see it as essential for economic development to be based on a healthy balance of payments, inflation control and the balancing of budgets in the developing States. These healthy balances of public finances are fundamental to creating climates of confidence and, ultimately, to enabling a State to progress and develop higher levels of well-being and, in turn, to promote economic growth. From that point of view, our report must place clear emphasis on stability. With regard to the European Union’s presence, we must not forget the problems we are currently facing within the European Union in terms of coordination and, therefore, although in the medium and long term we must move towards a single voice in the Monetary Fund and in other multilateral bodies regulating the world economy, we must be prudent and modest, as Mr Purvis pointed out, bearing in mind that, at the moment, we proceed on the basis of our various countries being represented in different categories. Furthermore, it is important, as in the case of Spain, that we stand shoulder to shoulder with much of Central America and Latin America, so that we also take more account of the economic development of a region as essential as Latin America in order to ensure balance in world development and to ensure development and equal opportunities for Latin American countries. This report therefore offers an opportunity for this Parliament to express its opinion and, in this regard, I hope that we are also working to achieve the greatest possible consensus and that this report will make a positive contribution to defining the role that needs to be played by multilateral bodies in modern economies.

Mr President, Commissioner, we are experiencing difficult times in the European Union, difficult times that are characterised by a lack of confidence, which leads to a lack of economic growth and an inability to create employment. At times such as these, when reforms of the Institutions are being carried out, as in the case of the Stability Pact, it is important that all the institutions of the European Union are present and that they participate in those institutional reforms, in order to give them more credibility and in order to communicate to the European citizens, at the end of the day, that those reforms are aimed at producing economic growth and creating employment. That has been the purpose of this European Parliament action: a clearly constructive purpose. Some of us are very critical of the Spring Council; we believe that the Pact should not have been reformed in the way it was. Despite this, however, we have presented constructive initiatives in order to supplement no less than the preventive aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact, and it is therefore absurd that the Council should dig its heels in and not allow a European Parliament initiative of a constructive nature which is intended to make the Stability Pact more reliable and more credible. I trust that this situation will change, that tomorrow the European Parliament will express its support for these amendments and act consistently and, also, that the intransigence of the Council will be overcome, after ascertaining the situation and the causes of the difficult crisis we are experiencing in Europe. The Commissioner, who is here today, is well aware that the budget surplus — what a budget surplus you achieved when you were responsible for finance in Ireland, Mr McCreevy ... it makes us jealous... — is well aware that the quality of public finances makes a contribution to confidence when it comes to promoting economic growth and job creation; that is what the European Union needs at the moment and that is what we aspire to. I would like to end by thanking Mr Karas, who has done a commendable job, for his attitude and his work.

Mr President, allow me to put the following question to the House: would we be experiencing the current crisis in the European Union if economic growth and job creation were strong here, if the large European countries were offering us a different profile, if they were promoting the whole of the European Union and contributing to balancing the world economy? Surely the answer would be ‘no’. There would be resources, there would be money to fund enlargement, for the challenges of the European Union. But there is no economic growth because there is no confidence. And there is no confidence because we lack determination when it comes to applying and implementing confidence and stability policies. That is the contribution of the Stability Pact. Its reform, Mr Almunia, comes at a complicated time. The next thing now under threat in this crisis in the European Union is the euro. The reform of the Stability Pact must therefore be the right reform. Mr Karas has done an excellent job trying to remedy a mistaken proposal on the basic content of the Stability Pact. Mr Almunia has told us tonight that the Commission is satisfied with Parliament's position on improving the quality of statistics and the surveillance of debt. I would also like to hear from Mr Almunia that he is in agreement with the listing of relevant factors, which are extremely important if the Stability Pact is not to be a box in which we can fit everything, and in which, at the end of the day, the rules can be ignored. We have reached a situation in which each country does what it sees fit in order to promote the policy of budgetary stability and, if relevant factors are undefined, this would be practically impossible. We have an example within the European Union of Fifteen: the countries which have done their duty in budgetary terms are the ones which today are enjoying economic growth and employment. We do not have to look for models elsewhere. We should identify those countries within the European Union and all apply those policies.

Mr President, the European economy is in a very delicate situation. The recent European Summit coincides with a downwards review of the European Commission's economic growth forecasts and, therefore, with a review not just of growth, but also of job creation. What we are being told is that, in the Europe of 2005, the unemployment rate is going to rise and there is going to be economic stagnation. And that is negative and is what we must respond to by sending clear messages, messages of confidence for consumers and messages of confidence for investors. The European economy's problem is a lack of confidence, which stems from economic policies which are not able to inspire that confidence. The Lisbon agenda, the Stability Pact and the liberalisation of services are key elements in terms of increasing this confidence. And we have missed an opportunity in March. We have missed the opportunity to promote healthy public finances and there are examples of this within Europe. The countries which have made an effort to rationalise their budgets are the countries which are growing and creating employment in Europe. The countries that have made the structural reforms contained in the Lisbon agenda are actually the countries which are growing and which are creating employment within the European Union. We cannot talk about the European social model without looking at those countries and we cannot express self-satisfaction when what has been carried out is a review of the Stability Pact based on the political interests of large countries which are not growing and which are not creating employment, and when doubts are being raised about the very nature of the Stability Pact and when there is a lack of confidence in the economic reforms that the European Union requires. This is the opportunity facing you, Mr Barroso, if your project to provide Europe with the growth and employment we all want to see is to be viable.
 Montoro Romero (PPE-DE

Mr President, I agree with the analyses expressed here this morning insisting on Europe’s need for more growth and more employment. More growth to confront the challenges facing us as Europeans: the challenge of enlargement, the challenge of creating jobs for our women and young people. More growth so that Europe can play the leading role it deserves in the world economy, since, otherwise, the world economy will not have balanced growth. As Mr Rasmussen has just emphasised, that means that European consumers and European investors need more confidence, they need confidence policies, policies, in short, on which to base their consumption and investment decisions. In turn, that confidence requires healthy public finances and budgetary balance. Budgetary balance means less taxes for workers and for small and medium-sized businesses, less taxes in order to compete more successfully within the globalised world economy. Making the Stability Pact more flexible would be a grave error and, Mr Almunia, Commissioner, the press coverage of the debates in Ecofin are not inspiring confidence; the confrontation amongst European governments in relation to promoting the flexibility of the Stability Pact sends a negative message in terms of the confidence of the markets. Together with a firm Stability Pact, we need structural reforms. We need a more flexible economy, not ultimately one that is good for the few, but a balanced economy which supports our growth on the basis of flexibility and competitiveness.

 Madam President, we would have liked to see Mr Mandelson still in his place here, rather than having bolted, which appears to have been the European Union’s coup de grace to the Doha Round. The global financial crisis does not augur a promising future for Doha. This collapse is in turn worsening the global economic situation, and the less developed countries will pay most dearly for it. The WTO is necessary; the regulation of international trade is essential. Regulation is now a key asset in globalisation, as we are seeing. It is therefore necessary that we reach an agreement in the Doha Round. We will have to reflect on improving the way that the WTO operates and its legitimacy, and the role in this Round of the ‘emerging’ countries, who choose whether to be developing or developed countries as it suits them. As the resolution states, the dialogue should not only be North-South, but also South-South. The European Union has taken very significant steps in these negotiations, more so than others. We have also taken steps with initiatives such as Everything But Arms. 
Others also have to move in this direction, and in the interim, let us conclude the pending association agreements, such as with Mercosur, which are essential in this new context.

 President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that we are having this debate. Since 2005 Parliament has been warning both the Commission and the Council of the dangers involved in navigating the waters around Somalia, even the international waters. Following various hijackings of boats and armed robberies, the European Union has just created a ‘coordination cell’. It is very welcome; at least it is finally being recognised that there is a problem. However, I fear that even with this cell, the problem will continue to exist. Until we have real cooperation and a genuine Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Member Sates whose interests are affected will continue to be forced to protect themselves and defend their legitimate national interests. France has clearly understood this, and I congratulate it on its decisiveness, courage and efficiency. Spain has also reacted by planning to send a reconnaissance plane, in other words, an unarmed plane to dissuade armed pirates. It is a shame that this plane will not be enough to adequately defend and protect our fishermen if there is an armed boarding of our fleet. We need to ask for and secure more cooperation between the Member States that are affected, we need to take advantage of the French Presidency of the Council and allocate more resources so that legal fishing in international waters is not, as it is there, a high risk activity, due to acts of piracy that are inconceivable in international society in the 21st century.

 Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleague Mr Kamall on his report, in which he highlights the need to develop an international services market that takes into account the different situations of developing countries, without forgetting that the conditions must be fair for all parties. On the one hand, there is the great potential for the European Union to open up its services sector to new markets, in which it has a major comparative and competitive advantage at global level: the development of new channels for the sector, one of the main tools with which Europe can face up to the challenge of globalisation. On the other hand, it has many advantages for developing countries. Firstly, benefiting from the European Union’s knowledge and skills in this field, which they need in order to develop their own economies, especially in basic and cross-disciplinary sectors such as financial services. It would therefore facilitate the transfer of technology from European institutions and businesses. The existence of a more favourable economic framework would cause a ‘call effect’ of investment from other parts of the world; therefore the benefits for their economies would be multiplied. Secondly, the progression of the negotiations would improve conditions, both for those who want to provide services and for businesses who want to establish themselves in Europe. I would like to highlight in the report the need for the ILO’s fundamental rules to be complied with, especially with regard to child and forced labour, because there should be openness with asymmetry, yes, but while respecting the rules of fair competition and fair play; never forgetting the interests of our businesses. We need to ask for more commitment, in particular from the big emerging economies, China, India and Brazil, always within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. The report mentions specific situations with different trade blocks such as ASEAN, the Gulf States, India and Korea. There is one area missing from the report, whose level of development and economic situation are ideal for developing our services sector. I am talking about Mercosur, and within it, particularly about Brazil; I was rapporteur for a report on the status of the negotiations with that country in Parliament. Therefore, even though it does not expressly appear in the main points of the report, I did want to mention it so that it would also be included.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we had great hopes that renegotiation of the protocol to the Agreement with Mauritania might be able to make up for the previous poor negotiation; we also thought that it would serve to rectify the unsatisfactory outcome to the negotiation of the Morocco Agreement for the commercially important cephalopod fleet, which has huge socioeconomic significance in Galicia and has therefore been suffering the effects of these two poorly negotiated agreements, in addition to the general crisis in the fisheries sector. However, it was not to be, and so we cannot praise or congratulate the Commission on this outcome. In general, there is a huge reduction in fishing opportunities and financial compensation is not tailored to that reduction. Little heed has been paid to the sector affected, and the technical measures which have been agreed, besides being ambiguous, are prejudicial to the Community fleet. In the case of cephalopods, the minimum size for octopus, as the report said, is the highest in the region, and there is no need for it, with the result that this cephalopod fleet has effectively been finished off and, as if that were not enough, the allocation of licences is damaging to relative stability, which is harmful to the Spanish fleet. As you will understand, Mr Borg, although we very much regret the fact, all these considerations mean that we cannot congratulate you on the results achieved in this case, because I believe that they could and should have been much better.
 Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna  (PPE-DE

(ES)
 Mr President, Mr Borg, ladies and gentlemen, in this debate there are a number of things we need to recognise. In the first place, if the fishing industry were not crying ‘enough is enough’, we would not be here today debating the urgent need to adopt measures. That is the first thing. Secondly, we need to recognise that the European institutions have taken up this cry of protest. Parliament in particular has already adopted a resolution on the crisis at its last part-session. Moreover, we have to acknowledge, as we told Mr Borg this morning, that the Commission has acted with uncustomary swiftness in presenting us with the package of measures which we are debating today. We should all welcome this. Is everything sorted out, then? No, far from it. We are only just beginning. The Commission has submitted what we might call an initial first-phase document to tackle the crisis, an aid plan focussing on fleet restructuring. We now need the Commission to submit a plan for the second phase, with the same urgency, containing measures to increase fleet profitability and improve marketing as well as measures aimed at promoting the value of fish at the first point of sale, measures for which we have no precise timetable as yet. Nonetheless, the Council and the governments of the Member States have to apply the measures, acting as swiftly as the Commission and Parliament have done, and in line with our requests they must increase controls on imported fish products and launch extensive consumer information campaigns in order to promote the interests of our fishermen. If such a plan did not materialise, and if we were left with what we have on the table today, Mr Borg, all we would have is an ingenious and generous operation which takes advantage of the current crisis to reduce the fishing fleet rather than make it more profitable and rescue it from the serious crisis which it is facing today.

Mr President, on the initiative of my Group, and with everyone’s support, we are debating the serious crisis in the fisheries sector and we are doing so separately from the general fuel crisis because even though the price of fuel has aggravated the crisis, it is only the straw that broke the camel’s back. The crisis is much deeper and needs to be dealt with urgently. To save the sector the Commission, the Council and the Member States must in agreement adopt a programme that fulfils the following 10 requirements that I have garnered from this debate. One: more checks on illegal imports. Two: more checks on legal imports. Three: reform of the COM with greater emphasis on prices to fishermen at initial sale. Four: reorientation of the aid under the European Fisheries Fund. Five: reprogramming of national operational programmes. Six: payment and increase in the amount of de minimis
 aid per vessel; fortunately, the Commission seems to have understood this but the proposal has to be improved because it is not exactly what we want. Seven: adoption of fiscal aid. Eight: adoption of social aid. Nine: improved transparency and consumer guarantees, labelling and traceability. Ten: consumer advertising campaigns and sectoral support. These 10 requirements can be summarised in just two: greater payments and aid for our fishermen, and sanctions for offenders. Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, either we do this now or we will literally have to carry the European Union’s fisheries sector. I know that Commissioner Borg is aware of these issues and is doing what he can, but I believe that we must help to improve this proposal. I hope that the Council will also do the same next week and that we can take advantage of the French Presidency, which is propelling this reform, to implement it in full. We must use the opportunities available because time is of the essence.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to reiterate the importance of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) for the economic and trade development of the beneficiary countries. Parliament’s amendments have largely improved the proposal for a regulation, which will cover the 2009-2011 period, and have focused on aspects that could improve the conditions for using the system by these beneficiary countries, such as provision of technical assistance by the European Union, which is a fundamental element for taking better advantage of the trade benefits of the GSP. It is also worth highlighting the possibility for some countries to apply for inclusion in the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development, GSP+, which is more advantageous, and moreover the fact that they can do so every year. I think, however, that some of the amendments adopted in the Committee on International Trade go too far. Amendment 8, regarding the possibility that countries that are not the final recipients of exports can benefit from the more favourable GSP+ and Everything But Arms arrangements, could be detrimental to some countries that really do deserve to be included in these arrangements. In general, it could create more confusion in the application of the GSP and of the rules of origin. This is an issue that should be left for the next review of the rules of origin. I think that there is also a need to highlight, as some of my colleagues have done, the importance of the European Commission presenting studies assessing the impact of the GSP in the beneficiary countries. I think, however, that this study should focus on the purely trade aspects and not cover other areas that do not fall under the scope of this regulation. Finally, I would like to point out, echoing the Chairman of the committee himself, Mr Markov, that our amendments strengthen the role of the European Parliament in the application of the regulation. What is being considered in the regulation is the future role of the European Parliament in trade policy once the Lisbon Treaty has been adopted, as I hope it will be.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is taking place during the most serious crisis in the Community fisheries sector that we have ever known. There are various reasons why costs are not being covered in the sector and why it is currently not profitable to go out fishing. Fish imports and the entry of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing into the European Union are among those reasons. We therefore support the proposal and the report, but they are not sufficient. I would like to take this opportunity to speak out in the European Parliament to ask the Commission and the Council to do something urgently, and not to allow this sector to die, as if it continues as it is now, it is going to collapse. I ask the Commissioner and the Council to prepare and adopt a joint urgent emergency plan that also includes medium and long-term measures. France is leading this battle, and the imminent French Presidency is a golden opportunity to make it happen. The Commission needs to exercise its right of initiative more actively — with aid, compensation, restructuring, innovations – in order to mitigate the costs that the sector is suffering from and curb unfair competition in imports. Time is running out. We wanted the Committee on International Trade to be part of this debate, because there is little point in banning IUU fishing if the European Union then opens its markets to it. Is it too much to ask for only legal fish to be sold in the European Union? We need more controls, more traceability and more and better labelling, in short more guarantees of what is entering the European Union. This needs to be done not only by the European Union but globally, through multilateral and bilateral channels. Partnership agreements should also be a tool for achieving this, with the corresponding technical assistance and training, in order to create not new barriers to trade, but rather measures that are effective for all the parties involved. On this rests the future of a whole economic sector, which in the European Union is very concentrated in regions that are highly dependent on it, and therefore it has huge social repercussions. On this also rests the sustainability of fisheries resources, which are a prime source of healthy food, at a time when there is a food crisis.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ford, on his good work and on the final result of his report, which with the contributions of the Committee on International Trade and the other committees has turned out to be a very balanced report. I would firstly like to say that the report highlights the major opportunity to deepen our trade and economic relations in this area of potential economic development and population growth, and I would also like to say that it takes into account the enormous disparities between the Member States of the ASEAN block. I would like to stress the importance of opening up the services sector, for both parties: it is crucial for the Union but also for ASEAN, which both need to demand more efficient services of higher quality for better prices, thus taking advantage of the EU’s competitive advantages and experience. With regard to industry, we pointed out in our amendments, which have been incorporated into the report, the dual need to comply with minimum quality and hygiene and health requirements. These are demanded of our European industry and they should also be required of the other side in order to curb unfair competition. In addition, compliance with international agreements on social, employment and environmental matters; and especially, we would like to stress, the fight against child labour. We have drawn attention to the sensitive fish processing industry, because both problems exist there. We therefore genuinely fail to understand socialist Amendments 11 and 12, which dilute and reduce what was already adopted in committee, removing from current paragraphs 16 and 17 the specific mention of the tuna sector, which is really affected, of the resulting unfair competition and of the report by the European Parliament itself on this industry, that was and is supported by the European Commission. Therefore, for the sake of the consensus that has existed around this whole report, we ask the rapporteur and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to consider this and think about withdrawing Amendments 11 and 12, which our group will not support. In short, I think that, if this is done, what we will achieve is keeping the current ones, which are more complete and better than the ones they are seeking to introduce.

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the Portuguese Presidency and the Commissioner for their necessary and relevant comments in the light of the text of the clear question put by the Committee on International Trade. Brazil, as we all know, is a large and admirable country with enormous potential which is at a crucial point in its political and economic development. Our mutual relationship is strong and we can and should strengthen it further. Brazil’s special links with Portugal, and Portugal’s links with Brazil, are also known, recognised and respected by all.  – 
(PT) 
We well understand the position of our good and esteemed Portuguese friends, their interests and their concerns, because we share them.  (ES)
 However, the European Union, the Commission, the Council and Parliament have always expressed support for consolidating the regional integration of Mercosur, negotiating with the block and, as far as possible, supporting regional consolidation. As has been said here, Brazil undoubtedly has a key role in this. If the Communication from the Commission and the strategic relationship proposed with Brazil go in this direction, so much the better. This would still be supporting the European Parliament, which expressed itself here in the debate and in the vote that took place on the report, for which I had the honour to be the rapporteur, on the EU’s negotiations with Mercosur, which was adopted a year ago, and to which I refer. Therefore, given the confusion that had arisen from this Communication, Parliament needed to ensure that this point would be clarified and that we would be kept informed. We are also aware that the expectations of concluding an ambitious agreement between the European Union and Mercosur cannot go on forever, and if Mercosur itself does not make progress with its integration, and the European Union’s negotiations with Mercosur remain stagnated, with or without a Doha agreement, a decision would have to be taken on them, and once again the most important thing would be effectiveness: a bilateral agreement with Brazil. But unless this happens, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim is to reach an agreement with Mercosur. In short, yes to Brazil, but without damaging the negotiations with the whole of Mercosur.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are putting this oral question on the renegotiation of the Government Procurement Agreement, which will end in March, because we are at a crucial moment. Furthermore, in view of the importance of that agreement and its period in force, which will once again be ten or twelve years, it became necessary to raise the issue with the Commission here in Parliament. The government procurement markets are becoming increasingly important in the world, in view of their volume, which may be up to 25% of world GDP and, furthermore, because they represent a comparative advantage for the European Union, since at the moment we can be competitive in this sector compared to the competition that we are facing from other countries in other sectors, such as agriculture and industry. If we want to adapt to globalisation, therefore, it is important that the European Union develop the sectors in which it can be competitive internationally and thereby create fair and favourable conditions for European companies. In most countries, these markets are reserved for national companies, which is one of the main non-tariff barriers to international trade. There are two aspects in this renegotiation that I would stress in particular. Firstly, the geographical extension of this agreement, with the entry of significant players, such as China and the developing countries, and, secondly, the need to ensure fair, balanced and reciprocal conditions for the companies of the different countries. With regard to the first point, the greater the geographical area covered by this agreement on government procurement the more valid it is. Parliament therefore wishes to know whether any new countries are interested in signing up to the agreement in the short term, and particularly whether we can expect substantial commitments from China in relation to the opening up of its public markets. Let us not forget that China committed itself to opening up its government procurement market – which largely remains closed, or has requirements that are unacceptable to European companies – and to beginning negotiations in 2008 on accession to the Government Procurement Agreement, following its accession to the World Trade Organisation. Secondly, with regard to fair and reciprocal conditions, we must remember that the European Union's public markets are already very much opened up to international competition. This has considerable advantages for the public bodies awarding contracts, since this openness gives them greater choice and therefore makes it possible for them to find better quality goods and services at lower cost. Let us not forget, however, that this may harm European companies in cases where foreign competitors are preferred. The Union’s trade policy is geared towards greater opening up of all aspects of the international markets. The solution is not therefore to close the public markets to foreign companies. For this reason, we have the legitimate right to demand that our companies enjoy similar conditions of access to the public markets of our main trading partners, whose companies currently enjoy access to our public markets. That is not currently the case, however, since the commitments made by our trading partners are very limited compared to those made by the European Union. Commissioner Mandelson also referred to this imbalance in his communication on a competitive Europe in a globalised economy. In it, he suggests the possibility of introducing concrete restrictions to access to certain sections of the Union’s public markets, with the aim of persuading our trading partners to open up their markets in a reciprocal manner. Having said all of that, I consider this oral question on behalf of the Committee on International Trade to the European Commission, calling upon it to explain its strategy in this renegotiation of the agreement, to be timely – and hence more than appropriate. I would repeat that we are at a crucial time, since we need to reach an agreement over the coming weeks. How is the Commission going to defend the interests of European companies in the markets of sectors in which we are highly competitive, such as transport, energy and public works, within the context of the objective of continuing along the path towards greater commercial openness, and not the reverse? Within this context, how are we going to deal with the situation of European SMEs, which are already at a disadvantage compared to large companies, compared to the situation of other SMEs in other countries whose governments reserve a proportion of their public contracts for them, as in the case of the United States? In view of the lack of reciprocal arrangements, the disadvantages faced by European SMEs and their importance in terms of the main objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, we would call upon the Commission to demand that the other parties in the negotiation remove their exceptions or, if that is not possible, to accept our application of an exception of this same kind in favour of European SMEs. In any event, we need that kind of reciprocal arrangement since European companies are currently at a disadvantage. I would therefore ask the Commission to tell us how the negotiations are progressing, particularly with regard to the issues that I have raised and those referred to in the text of our question. I would also ask the Commission to take note of the concerns expressed by the European Parliament and to take them into account in its negotiations in Geneva.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by informing you that Commissioner Mandelson has contacted me to explain why he is not attending this debate, and I am grateful to him for that. The reason is the Summit on India in Finland; this led to an interesting conversation with the Commissioner on the agreement with Mercosur, in which I explained to him that, as well as India or China, Brazil and the Mercosur group are also emerging powers, a view that the Commissioner certainly, and fortunately, shares. Let us hope that, when the bleak scenes of the Doha Round have faded away, when the elections in Brazil have taken place and when the political, economic and commercial foundations for the European Union's relations with Mercosur have been laid, which is this Parliament’s intention in the report we are presenting today, we will take the definitive steps to guide the final phase of the negotiation of an ambitious European Union-Mercosur Association Agreement. That is the intention of our report: to restore a political, economic and commercial priority, to establish a collection of principles, rules and guidelines that give form to a strategic political priority, and to strengthen the framework for relations between two trading blocs. If we can bring them together by means of an Association Agreement which, together with the political aspects of cooperation, involves an agreement on the creation of a free trade area, we will have taken the historic step of creating the world’s largest such free trade area. At a time when new powers are emerging in the East, this would be a way to enhance the mutual interests of two blocs that are united by history and culture, with all the benefits that that would bring to our citizens on both continents. We are talking about a combined population of more than 700 million inhabitants. Our report therefore calls for a full, ambitious and balanced agreement based on three pillars: a political and institutional chapter reinforcing democratic dialogue and political cooperation; a cooperation chapter promoting sustainable economic and social development; and a trade chapter establishing an advanced free-trade area with a broad agenda including, as well as reciprocal liberalisation of trade in goods and services, investment, public procurement, the protection of intellectual property rights, cooperation regarding competition and trade protection instruments, trade facilitation, and a binding dispute settlement mechanism. Mexico and Chile are good examples of how our relations can be intensified by means of an association instrument. With Mercosur representing 45% of the population of Latin America and the region’s largest market, as well as 45% of its GDP, the great potential for growth on both sides is clear. Furthermore, unlike what is happening in Latin America as a whole, where US imports are three times higher than those from the EU, in Mercosur the EU quota is about 25% compared with 20% from the United States. According to the Institute of Political Studies in Paris, the costs of not reaching an agreement are estimated to be some EUR 3.7 billion per annum in trade and goods, rising to over EUR 5 billion if one includes investment and services. The trade agreement must be wide-ranging and cover all sectors, though the specific sensitivity of certain products must of course be taken into account, as the report indicates. We did not wish to look into the details of the agreement’s impact on the different sub-sectors, but rather we thought it appropriate to analyse the issue as a whole, to analyse the mutual interests at stake in the negotiation altogether. Our report therefore refers both to the EU's interests in Mercosur and to Mercosur's interests in the EU, and specific sections are dedicated to such important aspects as agriculture, with references to subsidies, geographical designations, bioethanol, etc.; NAMAs, where we include a special reference to fisheries and the sensitivity of certain processed products, such as canned tuna; services, where it is essential to achieve real improvements and clear and stable regulatory frameworks; investments, which are fundamental for sustainable economic development and generating employment and prosperity; public procurement and intellectual property, as well as the clear identification of possible barriers to trade and the approximation of rules on certification, accreditation, standardisation, etc., to promote fair trade and competition; and the establishment of an agreed dispute settlement instrument. As well as the strictly technical and commercial aspects, the report also covers the mechanisms necessary for the industrial, employment and social cooperation of small and medium-sized businesses and aspects relating to technology, science, environmental measures, energy and communication, as well as European Union aid and solidarity mechanisms. Finally, we include the necessary inter-parliamentary cooperation between the European Parliament and the Mercosur Parliament in order to make the agreement more democratically representative and bring the sometimes excessively technical aspects of the agreement more into line with the feelings of the citizens we represent, thereby giving the agreement a greater popular dimension. We believe that, by means of this report, the European Parliament is making clear its support for a far-reaching and ambitious Association Agreement between the old continent and a large part of the new continent, which we want to be integrated, and we call upon the Commission to speed up the negotiations so that the agreement can become a reality as soon as possible, for the benefit of the citizens of both continents. I would like to end, Mr President, by thanking all of the parliamentary groups for their invaluable understanding and support. I have received much understanding and support and I needed as much of it as possible in order to achieve the broad consensus that we wanted.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the oral question by our Committee on International Trade is very relevant and timely. The European Parliament cannot look the other way when negotiations which are so important at multilateral level and which had offered such great hopes for more organised, transparent, free and fair trade are suspended. We would refer to the motion for a resolution presented by our group with regard to the concrete aspects we are debating here. We would like to point out, however, that a failure of the Doha Round would be a failure for international trade and for the multilateral system, since it would jeopardise the achievements such as tariff and trade preferences and would lead to a multiplicity and overlapping of rules, thereby making companies’ lives more difficult. The real fundamental reasons for this failure must be entirely exposed. The inflexible States that have hindered the negotiation must be condemned, and we must not give up on the negotiations. They must be revived so that we can take advantage of the progress already made and make the Doha Round a success for the sake of a fairer form of globalisation and for the sake of the WTO itself. The very future of this organisation is at stake; the WTO could be greatly harmed by this crisis. This requires serious reflection, and the WTO’s operating mechanisms must be updated, modernised and democratised. The European Parliament must continue to play the role that has been assigned to us by seriously and rigorously monitoring the situation that has been created and promoting a solution to the current impasse for the good of everybody, but above all, as others have said, for the good of the least-developed countries. Commissioner, we are grateful to you for being here and for the information you have given us, and you know that you can count on this Parliament, as other speakers have said, in the efforts to unblock these negotiations.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the fires in Galicia this summer have been put out badly and late. The result has been a disaster. According to Commission sources in the middle of August – and I would be grateful if the Commissioner could give me a more up-to-date figure today – 88 473 hectares have been burnt, not including burnt areas of less than 50 hectares, of which there are many in Galicia, where farms are small, and the total burnt area is therefore well over 100 000 hectares, which is equivalent to 80% of the total area burnt in Spain and half of the entire area burnt in Europe. Four fatalities, 514 injured, 35 villages evacuated, the main communication routes cut, many animals killed and seriously injured: in short, a real tragedy, an unprecedented environmental and human disaster, with immeasurable economic and social consequences. Unquestionably Galicia’s worst environmental disaster. The Prestige
 disaster, which has been mentioned here, did not lead to any human victims and Galicia recovered quickly, as a result of the rapid action of marine regeneration, but this latest tragedy has left us with human victims and burnt areas that all the experts say will take 20, 30 or perhaps even more years to recover. How will it affect the climate, biodiversity, underground aquifers and the Natura 2000 areas that have been devastated? Commissioner, what has failed this year in Galicia? Do you know? Do you believe that the fire can be said to have been tackled effectively in Galicia? You have told us here that the Spanish authorities asked for assistance and the European Union quickly responded. Could you tell us the date when it was requested, as others have asked? Could that cooperation have been improved? Given the European dimension of this disaster, it falls to us in this Parliament to emphasise its magnitude and also to call for the resources necessary and assistance available to alleviate its dramatic short-, medium- and long-term consequences and to cooperate so that we can find out what has failed, in order to stop it happening again. To this end, we would ask for the urgent mobilisation of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund for Galicia, which has been devastated by fire and which is facing a very serious ecological, economic and social situation.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as promised, we are here today, just one part-session later, in a position to present plenary with a report by our Committee on Fisheries on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Morocco. We believed that our committee should not be deprived of the opportunity to debate this sensitive agreement, and it therefore had to be debated and approved by us first. I believe that this time has been extremely useful: it has been useful for the rapporteur, who now has more information than he had before, and it has been useful in that it has given us a more in-depth awareness of what has been agreed and of what has not yet been agreed. It has also made it possible for us to help the Commission to promote an Agreement in which certain very important issues are still subject to negotiation, entirely openly, as befits a Parliament. We are in a position today, therefore, to ask the House to vote in favour of this Agreement, but with the reservations, the adjustments, the guarantees and improvements that we have introduced in the Committee on Fisheries and which are included in the report. I believe that this report has improved the Agreement and Parliament’s institutional position and we have fully and responsibly carried out the duties for which we were elected. Our real objective was, and remains, to improve the guarantees for the fisheries sector, which is the beneficiary of the Agreement, to ensure compliance with its clauses and to make it operative and viable. We did not understand before, and we still do not understand, why some people were opposed to this exercise in responsibility and transparency. In addition to the technical fisheries issues that I will comment on in a moment, the Agreement was politically sensitive because of the thorny issue of the Western Sahara, which we could not sidestep but which we could not get involved in either. I have tried to remain neutral on this issue, acknowledging the problem but not speaking for any of the parties, in order to ensure that Parliament does not show any particular support for any one of them, though at all times respecting international law and the on-going dispute, and not ignoring it, including the United Nations’ doctrine regarding non autonomous territories. The opinion of Parliament’s Legal Service has been extremely useful and has been incorporated into the report, as well as the amendments by Mrs Attwooll, whom I would like to thank for her sensitivity and understanding, and the only amendment approved by the Committee on Development relating to the Sahara. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Kindermann, coordinator of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, for the assistance he has given me and for his efforts to keep his group united – although he has not achieved this entirely, I am aware of the efforts he has made. I therefore believe, as rapporteur, that the report is balanced and reasonable, although compromises mean giving some ground and not everybody can be one hundred per cent satisfied. I would now like to make a few comments about the strictly fisheries-related aspects of the report. The European Parliament expresses its support for the Agreement but, as I have said, it reserves for itself the task of scrupulously monitoring its application, which is fully in accordance with our duties of control over the Commission, calling for an exhaustive annual report on its application and in particular demanding that we be kept informed of each and every modification introduced into the text; in particular, we ask to be made aware of any opinions the Commission issues with regard to the possible modification of the Agreement’s exclusivity clause. We want to be made aware of how fisheries resources develop, in particular those species excluded from the agreement and of high commercial value, such as cephalopods and crustaceans, since, with the current exclusion, the Galician fleet is marginalised. We also want to be informed of the measures adopted to allow the Andalusian fleet to fish with lamps, as it has been doing, and also to ensure that there is no discrimination in this fishing area or in the measures intended to ensure landing in local ports. We also want to be kept informed of the technical measures that have not yet been clarified in relation to longline fishing and of the agreements of the joint committee that relate to the way in which the European Union’s financial contribution will be invested. The final distribution of fishing opportunities must be communicated to Parliament, since adjustments are still being made to them at the moment. To this end, we have approved the amendments by Mrs Fraga, so that distributions respect relative stability and the sector and Parliament can observe the application of these vital issues. While it may appear irresponsible to prolong the parliamentary negotiation of this Agreement indefinitely, we believe that it would have been more irresponsible to approve it blindly and hence to approve it without these demands and guarantees. Our wish has been to reassure all of the parties involved that the Agreement will be applied rigorously and seriously and in accordance with international rules. That was our difficult commitment and will continue to be so in the future, in order to ensure that the European Parliament conscientiously monitors its application once it has entered into force, in accordance with the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries and if the House adopts the report tomorrow, as I hope it will. I would like to thank everybody for their understanding and cooperation.

Mr President, I am speaking pursuant to Rule 134(3), as rapporteur for this report, to inform the House that the rapporteur is against the urgent procedure. I am against because, this being such a delicate issue, which has not been entirely concluded, involving an agreement which is still subject to substantial alterations by both sides, we cannot deny the competent committee, the Committee on Fisheries, its rightful report, debate and vote. Ladies and gentlemen, we do not want any shocks in the application of this agreement in the future, as has happened in the past. We want to provide the fisheries sector with guarantees of legal certainty, that what has been agreed will be fully implemented and that this agreement is viable. The Committee on Development has already given its opinion and we shall take its report into account. The Committee on Fisheries has not done so yet. With the compromise that I proposed yesterday to the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, which that committee has approved, my intention is not to delay the report but to speed it up so that it may be available in this House in May and so that we can conclude this issue under ideal conditions, since the first deadline for the first financial compensation ends on 30 June. We shall be on time and, in light of what Mr Kindermann has said, I would point out that for many of the species that are included in the agreement a biological rest period begins this month and next month, and they will not therefore be affected. For these reasons, we are asking that our committee work during the remaining time so that we can bring a report from the competent committee to the House. This is why we are rejecting the urgent procedure today.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this stage of the debate practically everything has been said. Perhaps the most important and relevant thing, as the Commissioner has said, is that Parliament is fully involved in the negotiation being carried out by the Commission. With regard to the assessment of Hong Kong, we have heard everything; nobody is entirely satisfied. It is like the metaphor involving the glass: some see it as half full and others see it as half empty. Has it been a complete failure? No. Has it been a complete success? No. Perhaps the success is that it has not been a failure, which it appeared it might turn out to be initially. What role has the European Union played? I believe that it is fair to acknowledge that the Commission and the Commissioner who has been in charge have played a very worthy role, and we should acknowledge this here. We should also acknowledge − I believe this is only right − that this Parliament has been kept fully informed by the Commission's services, which is a very important step in terms of the work to which the Commissioner has referred. Some people would have liked us to have given more ground on agriculture, but the European Union has clearly done it duty in this field with the reform of the CAP, as it has also done with the reform of fisheries by means of the CFP. There are other people who need to make progress in this field and, as other speakers have said, perhaps what has most grated in this House has been the United States’ hypocritical position with regard to the European Union in the field of agriculture and also on development issues. We have not made any progress on services, and others must be committed to opening up their markets to our large services companies: it is crucial for everybody. For them as well, since services affect all economic sectors and this is a crucial issue for the European Union. Talks and negotiations are continuing. They are complex. Skill, patience and plenty of will to hold dialogue and reach consensus are required. We want the Doha Round to be concluded to the benefit of everybody, everybody giving ground and reaching a satisfactory compromise with a view to freer and fairer trade, with multilateral and more transparent rules. In this regard, we would like to thank the Commissioner for remaining in contact with Parliament. As you have said, involving Parliament means involving the citizens. We represent the citizens and it is very useful that we are all in agreement.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of this Parliament’s delegation that will go to Hong Kong for the next meeting of the WTO, I fully support the common resolution that we are presenting and that we will vote on tomorrow. Since the creation of a parliamentary Committee on External Trade in 1979, this Parliament has followed the negotiations in the WTO closely, sending delegations since 1988, particularly now that we have a specific Committee on International Trade. The European Parliament thereby enhances the role that the European Union plays within the context of globalisation, at the same time making an effort to increase the transparency of the activities of that Organisation. Since the failures of Seattle and Cancún, it is now that the role of the WTO is at stake. As Commissioner Mandelson has told us, Hong Kong will be difficult but not impossible, and it must therefore be approached with a combination of realism and ambition. As other speakers have said, we cannot allow another failure. This Round, which is the priority objective of Community trade policy, is the best way to guarantee that the expansion of trade takes place in a balanced fashion, creating growth, but at the same time sustainable development within a multilateral context. As we know, the countries negotiate by making concessions in certain sectors in exchange for obtaining advantages in others. We must therefore all make a genuine effort to ensure that our offers are balanced. The European Commission has proposed a package in the field of agriculture which represents a great effort for the Union and probably much more for certain Member States. It will not, however, be possible to conclude these negotiations successfully without making progress on access to the markets for industrial products and the trade in services. The services sector, the most rapidly growing sector in the world economy, is essential to the Union and, furthermore, it is very important in itself and in view of its repercussions for other economic sectors. In the case of the NAMA, negotiations are at a standstill and are always dependent on results in other areas. Within this context, Commissioner, I would like to say that it is important for fisheries products to be given special treatment, differentiating them from other non-agricultural products. I believe that, given their special characteristics, resulting from the fact that they are a finite natural resource, they should continue to be given the same treatment as in the Uruguay Round, that is to say, they should be treated as sensitive products. I would like to end, Commissioner, simply by wishing you every success in your work for the good of everybody.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of my group, the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to stress the importance of the role played by Parliament in this area, with its deliberate strategy of providing time and improving on the Commission’s initial drastic proposals. This debate began some time ago, during the last term in office. The Commission presented us with an initial proposal which treated the situations of hake and cod equally. We had to stop it and we managed to do so. The situation of each species could not be compared. The Commission eventually agreed with us and presented two separate proposals. We also managed to differentiate northern hake from southern hake, with two different proposals. All of this happened following an important joint hearing in Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries with the sector and the scientists involved, in 2001. In the end we achieved a satisfactory result for northern hake and we also managed, in 2003, to postpone the debate on southern hake until this term in office, which allowed the sector and the scientists to provide more data and produce more specific proposals. I believe that Mr Borg's visit to Spain has also been fundamental in terms of rectifying the Commission’s initial position on southern hake and Norway lobster. We should therefore all be pleased, since I believe that this is the right approach, as is being demonstrated in the case of the Mediterranean. I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez, on her work and on the final result of her report, and everybody who has contributed to it, including the Spanish and Portuguese Governments, both previous and current, and the Members from my group, Mr Fraga and Mr Freitas, for their valuable contributions. I would also like to highlight the amendment we are presenting today to Parliament on behalf of our group, the PPE-DE, which will give the Member States greater flexibility in the application of their recovery plans. Finally, I would like to congratulate and warmly thank the Xunta de Galicia, which, within the Galician Advisory Committee, promoted and achieved the required unity in the sector in this decisive area, since their consensus has provided us with the basis for reaching a satisfactory and realistic agreement here.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur on his work, particularly given that his first report in this Parliament relates to a sensitive and complex area on which Parliament has had to act quickly. I would like to stress that our institution has not had sufficient time to consider and debate this complex subject in depth. Nevertheless, the report by the Committee on International Trade improves the Commission’s proposal and makes it more democratic, by enhancing the role of Parliament, and makes many aspects of it more balanced. Following the imminent entry into force of the new system of generalised preferences (SGP), it will perhaps be necessary to carry out a prompt assessment in order to ascertain the scope of the modifications introduced, and Parliament's control function is going to be extremely important in relation to complex issues, such as the practical application of rules of origin. I would like to stress my very positive view of the reference in the report to certain practical problems which may be faced by third countries in terms of immediate compliance with certain related international agreements, as in the case of El Salvador. Furthermore, I am glad that our amendments have been incorporated, which draw attention to the sensitivity of fisheries products, in general, and tuna, in particular, which are subject to great legal requirements in the European Union and imports of which must be properly controlled, in order to prevent further problems for a very sensitive industry which, furthermore, operates in European objective 1 regions which are very dependent, economically and socially, on this activity. I am pleased that we have persuaded the Commission to accept them, as Commissioner Mandelson acknowledged this morning.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was the European Council of December 2003 that, on the proposal of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, took the initiative to create a European Fisheries Agency. It was a good idea. The European Commission presented a proposal which clearly needed improving. Our committee produced a draft report which also clearly needed improving. We can therefore say that the draft now being presented to Parliament is considerably better than the initial drafts. Of the substantial improvements, I would emphasise the inclusion of the sector with full rights of participation, the extension of the competences to IUU fishing and the inclusion of training responsibilities. Nevertheless, I regret that the competences only include researching and developing technical solutions in relation to control and inspection, and that the Socialist Group has opposed amendments aimed at giving the Agency genuine competences in the field of scientific fisheries research which could contribute to improving the reports on the basis of which the Commission produces its legislative proposals on technical measures, the conservation of resources, TACs and quotas, since that would mean that the Agency and its experts would participate more actively in the common fisheries policy, thereby giving it greater credibility in the eyes of the fisheries sector. The Agency was strengthened as a result of the meeting of the Committee on Fisheries and I hope that it will be strengthened tomorrow in Parliament, although not in the way I would have liked. I trust that the Council can improve the situation.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to applaud the Commission's initiative to present a Communication prior to the reform of the GSP system, and I also applaud the timely initiative of our two parliamentary committees to present this oral question with debate jointly, the terms of which are indicative of Parliament’s desire for clarification of the Communication and, even more importantly, of the future legislation to modify the current GSP system. We agree with the Commission that we need to simplify, concentrate and ultimately improve the system in order to make it more effective in terms of achieving its aims. There are still grey areas, such as the improvement of rules of origin, the key element of the system, which must play a vital role in helping the countries benefiting from the GSP system through clear operating rules. The same can be said of the simplification of the GSP+ system, which we agree with, but which we believe still requires clarification in terms of the ratification or application of international standards which do not in practice represent an obstacle to the genuine application of the GSP system, as stated by certain Latin American countries such as El Salvador, or key aspects relating to incentives in the fight against drug-trafficking, which are crucial to countries such as Colombia and Bolivia. For all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, we are in favour of the objective of simplifying, concentrating and improving the GSP system, although we feel it prudent to wait to see how it translates into the Commission’s forthcoming legislative text. At this point we would draw attention to the need to set clear criteria with regard to rules of origin and maintaining the GSP system for the benefiting Latin American countries and, in particular, the rules relating to combating drugs, which still need to be refined. I will end, Mr President, by saying that we support the joint resolution presented today as a joint compromise amongst the different political groups putting their signature to it, which has meant everybody giving ground for the sake of consensus. We therefore reject the amendments which go further than this compromise and which create ambiguity in the treatment of rules of origin, which we wish to make as clear, transparent and precise as possible in order to help third countries, while preventing fraud in their application.

 Today we are debating the situation that has been created in Nicaragua by the attacks on some defenders of human rights, on certain fundamental freedoms and on democracy. I do not have to remind you here of Zoilamérica, or Ernesto Cardenal, or Carlos Mejía Godoy, or Jarquín, or Sergio Ramírez, or so many other Nicaraguans who now feel their hopes for a better Nicaragua have been betrayed. In November 2006, Mr Ortega asked the Nicaraguans for what he called a new opportunity, and they democratically gave it to him. We now know what he wanted it for. Since then, arbitrariness, nepotism and corruption have taken hold in the institutions of government, culminating in the electoral fraud of the 9 November ballot. Prior to that, some very serious decisions had been made, such as annulling the legal status of some opposition parties, or threats and intimidation directed at members of civil society, journalists and the media. President Ortega likened the governments of the European Union to flies landing in filth and considered the foreign aid that Nicaragua received mere crumbs. He soon realised that there was not enough Venezuelan oil for him to do without that development aid. When we are prepared to enter a decisive phase in the negotiation of an association agreement between the European Union and Central America, the Nicaraguan government must understand that it will always find an ally and a friend in us, but that respect for human rights, freedom of expression and democracy is for us, in short, a condition that we shall never waive, because we believe that it is, above all, the people of Nicaragua who benefit from it.

 Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote in favour of adopting Mr Galeote’s report on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands. As the Commissioner said, it is about continuing with an instrument that has already been in force for many years – since 1991 – that expired in 2006, thus filling a regulatory gap that existed until today. From a legal and budgetary point of view this regulation is justified. It is also justified from a political and economic point of view in order to maintain an activity that is essential for the Canary Islands. Since the loss of our fisheries in what were formerly known as the ‘Canary Islands and Western Sahara fishing grounds’, we have been forced to import products for domestic consumption, as in this case. The activities of a significant fishery products processing industry have been lost in the Islands since then. On some islands this activity was essential in order to prevent them from being solely dependent on tourism. With demagogic arguments and false accusations, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is tabling amendments against this regulation. In the Canary Islands Regional Parliament there are no Green members; in the 88 councils in the Canary Islands there are no Green councillors; of the 29 councillors on Las Palmas City Council there are no Green councillors; the Greens are barely present on a couple of councils in the Canary Islands, where they are definitely in a coalition with the People’s Party. I think it would be good to have a greater political presence of the Greens in the institutions of the Canary Islands, but with initiatives like this, full of demagogy and false accusations, believe me, I would like to say to the Member tabling the amendments, you are going in the wrong direction and you will have less and less political and social support in the Canary Islands.

Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Carlotti for the excellent cooperation between us when negotiating the amendments that are going to allow the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to back this report. Nevertheless, we have been talking about this issue for a long time – the Commissioner has reminded us of the many times we have dealt with it – but very little has been achieved so far. This is a clear example of the paralysis we are suffering from and illustrates the current situation of European politics in relation to one of our most serious problems. The Council has not been able to reach a common position, and it does not appear that it is going to do so, while each Member State adopts unilateral measures, which are often contradictory, and then asks the Council for help, as if the Council had nothing to do with them. The Commission says – as the Commissioner who is here today said a fortnight ago in Vienna – that it does what it can but that this is a competence of the Member States, and it is absolutely right. Furthermore, it currently lacks an operational and sufficient budget; we are working with the extension of a budget that expired almost a year ago now. Meanwhile, thousands of illegal immigrants are crossing our borders and in certain countries this happens on a daily basis. There is no doubt that we can do many things, as Mrs Carlotti’s report indicates. Money sent by immigrants triple — not double, as has been said — the total volume of official development aid throughout the world, but these investments do not represent an economically productive income in the countries of origin. There is little, and sometimes no, application of the Cotonou Agreement in the majority of cases. Article 42 of the European Union Treaty would allow for the adoption of measures to combat people trafficking; after three years, the Commission also told us a fortnight ago in Vienna that it is assessing the issue and will make proposals in the future. I could carry on giving examples, but those will suffice. I believe that the time has come to act and leave statements of intent for later and for less serious issues.

Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my solidarity with the Cuban dissident Marta Beatriz Roque, a descendent of European citizens from the Canary Islands, who this morning has been physically assaulted by thugs of the Castro dictatorship when trying to leave her house in Havana. Commissioner, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is very pleased with your Communication on a stronger partnership between the European Union and Latin America. For the first time in years, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the Commission and Parliament are using the same language when talking about Latin America. Mr Salafranca has presented an ambitious report which I am not going to reiterate. Commissioner, you should know that, when you defend your proposal in Vienna at the 4th EU-Latin America/Caribbean Summit, you will have the majority, if not the unanimous, support of the whole of the European Parliament. These are not good times for a proposal such as this, but many of us are convinced that we have a special opportunity to move in the right direction. The rapporteur has said that for many years we have been stating our good intentions towards Latin America, which is experiencing complex times both internally and in its relations with the rest of the world. It must resolve many of its problems itself, such as the current crisis with the Andean Community, but we must send an extremely clear message of support. The Summit must produce a mandate to begin and, where necessary, to enhance, the negotiation towards an Association Agreement with the Andean Community, with Central America and with Mercosur. This is a minimal requirement below which there is nothing. If the Union does not take certain clear and unequivocal steps to strengthen our relations with Latin America and with its sub-regional integration institutions, we may not have another opportunity like this for many years.

Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, the inclusion of a human rights clause in our international agreements is one of the European Union’s distinguishing features. Its content has been evolving over time and in accordance with the nature of successive agreements: currently more than 50 with more than 120 countries, as the Commissioner has just pointed out. Unfortunately, this has not prevented us from occasionally having to suspend our agreements because of human rights violations. With regard to the report that we are debating today, the Committee on Development wishes to stress the following points: Firstly, we would state that human rights are universal and indivisible and that human rights, democracy and development are highly interdependent. Secondly, we wish to stress that the fight against poverty is our priority and that we will not be successful without a global approach to processes of democratisation and development. Thirdly, we would insist on a twin approach in terms of conditionality: positive discrimination for countries that achieve greater progress and negative discrimination in cases of serious and persistent violations. Fourthly, we would stress the exemplary values of the Cotonou Agreement, given its extensive application to 77 countries and the effectiveness and flexibility of the suspensory clause laid down in Article 96, thereby making it the only agreement that has led to sanctions and that has functioned relatively well. Fifthly, we would insist that transparency is one of our governing principles. Sixthly, we support all measures aimed at achieving the Millennium Objectives and, in this regard, we welcome the G8’s decision to cancel the debt of the 18 poorest countries on this planet. Seventhly, we would appeal for greater commitment from the countries with which we cooperate in the achievement of those Objectives. Eighthly, we regret certain Commission decisions with which we do not agree, such as the lifting of sanctions on Sudan, given the serious events in Darfur.

Mr President, Commissioner, I have been draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development for successive reforms of the COM in bananas, and I have spoken in all the debates we have held, on 13 April 2000, on 13 December of that same year and on 4 September 2003, to mention just the most recent. Before leaving his post, Commissioner Lamy informed us, on 21 April 2004, that he intended to propose a tariff of EUR 230 per tonne of bananas imported. Since then, since the new Commission took office, both you and your colleagues and the Commissioner for Trade have sought to reach an agreement. You must acknowledge, Commissioner, that what you have said tonight does not shed much light on the direction you intend to take. You must clearly take the decision to apply a tariff from 1 January and we shall see how high it is. Nevertheless, you are very well aware – the Commission is very well aware – that that decision guarantees you a new dispute with the producer countries of the ‘dollar area’ within the WTO almost immediately if that tariff exceeds their expectations. In other words, we shall gain a few months of time at the expense of creating certain risks for the ACP group of countries and new uncertainties for our European producers. In the end, provided that nothing unexpected emerges from the imminent Hong Kong Summit, the Commission will have to seek a negotiated solution with the Latin American banana-producing countries. The legitimate question I would like to ask is why the Commission expressly gave up the search for that agreement during the months of March, April and May, when there is reliable evidence that, via various diplomatic channels, the Latin American producers sought an agreement, though of a transitional nature, on a temporary extension of the system in force which would provide a margin for the negotiation of a more stable and lasting solution. Commissioner, I believe that the Commission did not pay any attention to these wishes because, at that time, it was confident that the arbitration within the World Trade Organisation could agree to the establishment of a tariff of EUR 230. That was our first setback. Then a new tariff of EUR 187 was proposed, with identical results. You have confirmed here today that you are very disappointed by the result of the second arbitration of 27 October. At that time, the comments of certain officials, and your own comments, Commissioner, showed the same perplexity and disappointment that you have expressed today. You said then that it was necessary to prevent the banana dispute from being included on the Hong Kong agenda. I believe that this is another mistake, Commissioner. All it needed was for a country such as Honduras, which may be many good things, but is hardly an all-powerful giant of a country, to ask that the banana dispute be included on the agenda of the Hong Kong Summit, in order to achieve what the Commission wanted to prevent at all costs. You may feel reassured to know, Commissioner, that, during this final stage of the negotiation, with so much disappointment and bad news in terms of our interests, you have not been alone. You have been accompanied by certain national governments, such as that of my own country, and the governments of certain banana-producing regions. You have also had the understanding of certain representatives of the European banana producers, who appear to be resigned to awaiting a solution, which you have mentioned in your speech, involving a magic formula such as the one achieved in the so-called ‘Madeira Agreements’, which for the moment just has the air of a Portuguese fado
, which, as you know, Commissioner, is more a song of nostalgia and sadness than one of hope.

Mr President, we are discussing a regulation today which may go unnoticed amongst the serious problems facing the Union at the moment but which, for the agricultural sectors of the outermost regions, is of fundamental importance and which in many cases is a matter of survival. I would essentially like to stress two aspects of the draft we are discussing today: firstly, the maintenance of the funding, which was approved in the last reform in 2001 and which, given the current situation, is no small issue; and, secondly, the decentralisation of management that gives local authorities the power to introduce the necessary flexibility in accordance with the needs of the agricultural sectors at any given moment. In other words, there is no intention to make changes in terms of the level of the aid, but it is intended to create a more flexible instrument in the field of management, as indicated by Mr Duarte Freitas in his Amendments 4 and 21. The rapporteur’s Amendment 27 intends to give legal coverage for imports of C sugar in certain outermost regions, particularly in the Azores, the Canary Islands and Madeira; there are certainly obstacles here, but I hope that the Commission can analyse the matter and take it into account in order to find the most appropriate solution. In his speech, Commissioner Michel made an ambiguously politically-correct reference to the management of the specific supply arrangements for the islands — I am referring in particular to the Canary Islands. Believe me, Mr Michel, the people of the Canary Islands would like both the local authorities and the services of the Commission to guarantee the greatest possible transparency in the management of the SSA, of the specific supply arrangements for the islands.

Mr President, during the recent visit by a delegation from this Parliament to Guatemala, our attention was drawn to a particular issue, and the five Members, from different political groups, making up that delegation agreed that the adoption of children in Guatemala by foreign families causes an immense problem, represents a flagrant violation of children's rights and, ultimately, is the subject of an extremely lucrative business. According to official figures that we obtained there, in 2004, 3 824 Guatemalan children were subject to international adoptions and that figure, for a country with just over 12 million inhabitants, demonstrates that something is not working properly there. The adoption of a child costs between USD 25 000 and USD 30 000, and just 2 or 3% of that goes to the birth mother, that is to say, less than EUR 400. This means that the total sum obtained through this phenomenon of massive donations is the second largest of the country’s exports. The children concerned are generally children of single mothers, many of them girls of between 13 and 14 years old, largely indigenous and, in many cases, victims of drugs and/or prostitution. Over recent years, many Guatemalan governments have tried to approve a law to implement the Hague Convention on adoptions, but they have failed. The Guatemalan Congress, undoubtedly subject to external pressure, has not been able to approve that law. Now, the Guatemalan Government hopes that, over the coming weeks, a law will be approved to put a stop to this situation. My group therefore intends to send a very clear message to the Guatemalan authorities, communicating to them that they will have our every support so that their Congress can finally approve a law that imposes order on this truly intolerable situation.

Mr President, a quarter of a century has passed since Willy Brandt presented his report on North-South relations. Since then, the problem of poverty has not only not been resolved, but in many cases it has actually worsened. In reality, the latest report on poverty in the world demonstrates that there has only been a degree of progress in China, in some countries in South-East Asia and in some specific cases in Latin America. In Africa the figures are discouraging, and we must therefore welcome this British initiative, which I do not believe to be opportunist — it was announced by Minister Straw and his Prime Minister at least two years ago. After 40 years, dozens of wars and millions of deaths have left the continent of Africa exhausted. They are no magic formulae in the fight against poverty and only two things are certain: firstly, contrary to what some people think, poverty is not an economic problem, but rather a political one, and resolving it requires, as a priority, political decisions; secondly, in order be successful, we must ensure economic growth — without growth, there is no wealth to be distributed. In this context, these days we hear millions of voices calling for the application of traditional formulae throughout the world: increasing official development aid, cancellation of debt and fair trade. These are three necessary, but insufficient, measures. The political and social leaders of the countries suffering from poverty must demand much more, particularly in the field of strengthening civil society — strengthening their societies, transparency and good government, thereby increasing investments in health, education and gender policies. In Africa, there are more than 100 000 armed children, whose faces some of us have seen. If we want to make progress on the objective of reducing poverty by half by 2015, these points I have indicated demonstrate the direction we must take if we are to succeed.

Mr President, we do not know what is happening right now in Bolivia, which is experiencing some of the most dramatic times in its history. The Governmental Palace, the home of the Presidency of the Republic, is known by the Bolivians as the ‘burnt palace’. It has been burnt down several times during the many popular uprisings in that country. Opposite the Palace, in the Plaza de Armas de La Paz, there is a bust of President General Gualberto Villarroel, who was murdered, hung from a lamppost, in 1943 during one of the many insurrections that have taken place there. Fortunately, according to the information I received just half an hour ago, the presidential palace has not so far suffered any damage and the resigning President has just made a dramatic call to avoid bloodshed and civil war. I believe it is my duty to acknowledge, on behalf of my group, that President Mesa has honoured his commitment never to use violence to put down protest movements and I regret that such an exceptional attitude, which is so unusual in a country with a history such as that of Bolivia, has not been reciprocated by the opposition leaders who, in my opinion, have been overcome by events and whose statements over recent hours have become more radical. At this moment, in Bolivia, power is in the streets. At a time when the legislators are meeting in Sucre, because it has not been possible to access the Congress building in the capital, La Paz, due to the blockades, the foreign embassies have mobilised their emergency plans for evacuating the country. Today, when we are getting ready to vote and to approve the resolution supporting the Bolivians and calling for respect and supporting the institutions and the constitutional laws, it only remains for me to call on God and on the Quechuan and Aymaran Gods to enlighten their leaders and to bless and protect the Bolivian people.

Mr President, I welcome this Commission Statement on malaria, because three years ago, by approving our contribution to the budget of the Global Fund to Fight Malaria, Tuberculosis and AIDS, the Commission accepted Parliament’s request that it report to us regularly, and the previous Commission did not always do so. Furthermore, because in the fight against contagious diseases linked to poverty, AIDS is often the focus of attention, despite the fact that tuberculosis and malaria claim more victims every year and there is more chance of their being eradicated. Just a few years ago, malaria seemed close to eradication in many countries; today it is the most frequent cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, affecting more people and regions in which it had been eradicated. Recent figures suggest that there are more than 3 million direct and indirect victims of malaria each year. It is good that the Commission should promote the debate on the national protocols on the treatment of malaria, but that is not the most important thing if the objective is to include new therapeutic combinations, such as artemisinin and other therapeutic drugs. Mosquito nets treated with insecticides and intermittent preventive treatments significantly reduce morbimortality, but so far only Vietnam and certain countries in Latin America are showing encouraging results. In Africa, less than 10% of exposed children sleep protected by mosquito nets and the systematic use of those nets only protects 1% of the population at risk. The Commission, as a member of the governing council of the United Nations Fund for fighting these diseases, should increase the attention paid to malaria and, in view of experience, it should do the same with the sixth and seventh framework programmes for research and technological development, to which we provide EUR 400 million for research into these diseases, and thereby assist greater numbers of people at less economic cost, although that means fewer profits for the pharmaceutical industry.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to welcome you on the occasion of your first speech in a debate on human rights. You will always be welcome. Mr McMillan-Scott has gone over this Regulation, a regulation that clearly demonstrates all our virtues – our many virtues – and also many of our problems. It is a modest regulation in terms of its budget, but very ambitious in terms of its objectives; we all agree on the need to approve it but, nevertheless, we have spent a year and a half – perhaps much more – dealing with procedural and bureaucratic issues which have nothing to do with the fundamental issue, which is to approve it on time and properly so that the Commission may have an instrument allowing it to maintain the Regulation. It has been a very complex process. At the end of the last term in office we approved a regulation similar to this, by means of co-decision, relating to third countries. And now we are approaching the entry into force of the necessary extension, which begins on 1 January and ends at the end of 2006. The Commission and the Council are well aware that this regulation is highly valued by Parliament. I would point out that the budget line that provides for its funding – as Mr McMillan-Scott has just said – under the heading ‘European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights’, was created on the initiative of this Parliament – many of us who were present at that time are still here – and the Commission points out in its explanatory statement the full validity and the proper application endorsed by the impact assessment, which stresses the positive results concerning the development of the capacity of the NGOs specialising in human rights and concerning civil society organisations. The rapporteur has considered it appropriate to restrict himself to producing a report that expresses support for the Commission’s proposal, modified by the Council with the clarifications and explanations it has thought it appropriate to include, but I would point out that a Regulation, with the same content and an identical purpose, for which I myself was rapporteur, was approved at first reading by means of co-decision and that we in the Committee on Development were entirely flexible and raised certain reasonable and simple issues so that it could be approved at the end of the last term in office. What we have reiterated now in the amendments that in the end have not been voted for are very simple things which at that time we found it difficult to make understood. Parliament wishes to be informed and to know the results and the progress of the application of this project and wants these programmes to provide funding, as the Commissioner has pointed out, for peace missions and missions of electoral observers. Furthermore, it would like the Commission to present, on an annual basis or at intervals it considers appropriate, an analysis of the progress and results of the application of this project. I suspect that the agreement reached at the end of the last term in office by means of co-decision, with the Committee on Development responsible for the main report, has been modified unilaterally. I hope that this will now be corrected, on the basis of the application of the Regulation, which provides the Commission with the funds necessary for the application of an effective instrument, as this one is, for promoting democracy and human rights.

 Mr President, Álvaro Uribe was elected two and a half years ago. In that time, nothing has been easy, but the vast majority of Colombians – the vast majority, according to the figures – consider that the situation in the country is now better than it was two years ago. So it is no surprise that support for the Uribe administration is now greater than when he was elected, with a programme whose main objectives are to combat terrorism and bring peace to the country. Some of the figures are encouraging. Public order has improved, although Colombia remains an insecure country. The number of terrorist attacks and hostage-takings has fallen, although attacks and hostage-taking still happen in Colombia. Drug production and exports have decreased, although Colombia is still a leading player in international drug-trafficking. Whatever people say, there has been no serious decline in human rights in Colombia. It is the terrorists who take hostages and demand money who are contravening human rights and international humanitarian laws: not those who refuse to give in to the hostage-takers’ blackmail. Nothing has been easy and a lot remains to be done. At the moment, in the midst of controversy, the Colombian Government is trying to advance negotiations with the AUC paramilitaries. In view of the acknowledged difficulties of this process, the European Union should take a much more active role by exerting pressure on the parties involved and ensuring that victims’ rights are respected. We work closely with Colombia, but we can do more at this particularly sensitive time, by supporting the Organization of American States with its broad and clear mandate in Colombia. This includes financing programmes to monitor the ceasefire, to provide legal assistance for the victims and socio-economic projects for demobilised guerrillas and their victims, facilitating the reintegration of combatants and creating mechanisms to prevent revenge killings. Indeed, a great deal remains to be done, and we in the European Union should and can help. Commissioner, we cannot stay on the sidelines in this particularly sensitive period for reasons of political correctness.

Madam President, the present economic crisis throughout Europe will lead to an increase over the next few years in the number of people finding themselves under the poverty threshold. This number has already reached 80 million, in other words 16% of the world population. In the face of this crisis, it is of primary importance that we ensure continuity in the provision of food to those people most in need. The intervention stocks have so far been a useful tool both for providing the poorest people in the community with food, and at the same time ensuring stability in the prices received by European producers. However, these stocks are being progressively eliminated. It would seem fitting that the new aid programme for the poorest would also serve as an outlet for European Community produce. In this way, we would be helping to keep farmers in rural areas. The European Commission’s proposal does not demand that the food involved in the programme be produced exclusively in the Community, since it considers that to be contrary to the rules of the World Trade Organisation. I would like to remind the Commission, however, that the United States devotes nothing more and nothing less than 67% of its agricultural budget to food programmes for the most disadvantaged, which also has the add-on benefit of preferentially helping its farmers and cattlemen. This percentage is in sharp contrast with the expenditure proposed in the new Community programme, which would equate to only 1% of the common agricultural policy (CAP) budget.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are dedicating a debate in plenary to the reform of the European Union Solidarity Fund which, as we all know, is intended to alleviate the damage caused by a major natural disaster within the Union territory. This Fund very quickly proved to be ineffective in meeting its set objectives and, as a result, in 2005, the European Commission presented a proposal modifying the regulation governing this instrument of solidarity. The aim was to improve not only its operability, but also access to it and its coverage in the event of a major natural disaster. The European Parliament, as can be easily proven, worked promptly and intensively on this proposal so that in May 2006 our institution had finished its first reading. At that time we all thought and believed that the Council would do the same, given that this was a regulation under the codecision procedure. However, as we now all know, that was not the case. Contrary to expectations, the Council put a hold on the process due to its inaction. During this period, in addition to serious flooding, the European Union has suffered serious fires, which in some cases have resulted in deaths, and also major droughts. However, the Council has remained impassive. The proposal to improve the regulation is still sitting on the Council’s table, despite calls from the European institutions and social forces. Today we want to once again call on the Council to act and remind it that modifying this regulation will not require one additional euro from the Community budget: our demands have no financial consequences and aim solely at rectifying the operational problems that have arisen since this instrument of solidarity was created. We simply want to improve its operability and agility, always in line with the subsidiarity principle. We note that, as this instrument currently stands, access to it is very difficult, restrictive and inflexible, as we have unfortunately witnessed over the nearly seven years of its operation. I therefore want to ask whether this inability of the delegations forming the Council to reach a common position has any real explanation, and whether anyone can tell us who and what arguments are blocking reform of this regulation. We should like the European Commission to drive forward the reform of this fund, to tell us what actions it plans to take, and to clearly set out the possible alternatives that it is considering in order to help unblock this matter. If the Commission does have any alternatives, we should of course like to know what they are and what their time horizon is. I believe it is appropriate to remind those present, in particular the French Presidency, that this instrument was set up with a laudable objective: to promptly, adequately and visibly show the Union’s solidarity with its citizens. To end, Mr President, I want to make another call, this time specifically to the French Presidency, on a matter closely linked to this one: the creation of a European civil protection force, on which Michel Barnier, a former Commissioner as you all know, presented a report to the European Council in 2006. I am ending. The Fund was created in particular as a symbolic expression of solidarity between the European Union and its citizens. My final plea is that, if we manage, after so much time and effort, to make this operative in any degree, our first thought and action should be directed towards those who have died in these disasters in the European Union.

 Mr President, the exceptional geographical situation of the Canary Islands in relation to the sources of supply of certain fishery products which are essential for domestic consumption entails additional costs for the sector in this region and, as the Commissioner has just said, since 1991 the European Union has tried to remedy this natural handicap by, among other measures, temporarily suspending customs duties on imports of the products in question from third countries. This proposal for a regulation aims to guarantee that the measures set out in the 2002 regulation currently in force continue for the period 2007-2013. That regulation established a series of autonomous tariff quotas on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands, for the period 2002-2006. I would like to point out that the suspension of customs duties is only granted for products destined for the domestic market, and also say that this proposal was adopted practically unanimously in the Council and by a very large majority in the Committee on Regional Development. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled four amendments which, Mr President, we cannot support, because they mix concepts of illegal fishing with the content of this regulation, whose operation in practice has shown that the control filters established by customs in Las Palmas have worked correctly. This is endorsed by the report sent to the European Commission by the Spanish Government, which is of a different political persuasion than the one that I represent. The European Commission accepted this report, validated it and largely incorporated it into its proposal. The current European Commission proposal specifically ratifies the existing protective and control measures to avoid diversions of trade. To summarise, the appropriate anti-fraud measures are being implemented, and along with the customs filters previously mentioned they constitute an adequate set of instruments, under the control of the Community institutions, for the correct functioning and monitoring of the Community quotas, which, as has been proven, have nothing to do with illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. To conclude, Mr President, the imports of fishery products included in the quotas for the Canary Islands are legal, reported and adequately regulated and therefore I ask for the European Commission proposal to be supported and for the amendments tabled to be rejected.

 Mr President, I am going to be very brief because of the late hour, but especially because, firstly, the European Commission, which I assume is not suspicious, has been decisive in endorsing the controls established by the regional and national authorities and, in fact, here we are debating its proposal; secondly, because 27 of the 27 Member States have given it their support; and, thirdly, because the Committee on Regional Development adopted the proposal practically unanimously. The attitude of Mr Staes reminds me of the mother who went to see her son at the passing out parade for his military service and said to the person beside her: ‘Look how good my son is, because he is the only one who is marching properly, all the rest of his company are out of step’. I would ask those tabling the amendments to think again. Could it be that in this case they are the ones who are mistaken and not the rest of humanity?

 Mr President, I welcome the Committee on the Environment’s initiative, which we can add to a list of many others by the Committee on Regional Development in the present legislative period, even though these initiatives are not always well understood. The truth is that some developments, including some legal decisions, show our concerns were fully justified. Nevertheless, it is sad to see the Council being so insensitive and unresponsive. It is also paradoxical that questions affecting the environment, regional policy and agriculture are the responsibility of the Ministers of Finance. National governments should reflect on the stubborn refusal to reform the obsolete Solidarity Fund, despite the efforts of Parliament and the Commission and the clear public demand for such reform. I hope that this summer we do not suffer the scourge of fires, droughts and floods of other years. I hope the Council is not forced, once again, to issue empty communiqués of solidarity rather than offering coordinated civil protection mechanisms and funds to help people, leaving us to complain about citizens being indifferent and disinterested in what our institutions are doing. Some members of the Committee on Regional Development have presented amendments to draw the Council’s attention to the need for reforms and initiatives. We will see whether the Council, which is conspicuous by its absence today, is able to make some response.

 Mr President, I am convinced that the subsequent legislative development of Article 149 of the Lisbon Treaty will positively benefit sport in the European Union. However, in territorial terms or, in other words, on the ground, I believe that the European Commission, in exercising its legislative initiative, must act carefully with regard to the different local situations and the differences between sporting disciplines. Its contributions should be general and should respond to an overall European interest, and not to a thirst for interventionism. It must therefore be respectful of the principle of subsidiarity. This is what the Committee on Regional Development thought. As a result, I welcome the amendments tabled by various parliamentary groups in this same respect and I hope that, this morning, the House can adopt these through a positive vote.

Madam President, I agree with the author of the amendment and suggest that, where the text refers to the regional authorities of Andalucia, the words ‘and local’ should be added so that the phrase reads ‘regional and local authorities of Andalucia’.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is eight months since the shipwreck of the New Flame
 and there is still a risk of further oil spills, especially oil emanating from the cargo contained in the wreck. This situation has arisen due to factors which are daily occurrences in that area, failure to manage high-density traffic and massive oil transfer operations between vessels at sea. However, in this particular case, there has also been a chain of errors and abandonment of responsibility, in terms of monitoring of the vessel as well as after the collision. Therefore, Commissioner, this Parliament would be glad if you could answer the following four questions: One, do you have any information on the origin and degree of toxicity of the 42 500 tonnes of scrap metal not recovered? Two, can you tell us whether, following the collision and over these last eight months, there has been recourse to the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection and if so how many times? Three, do you know of any plans and time schedules to refloat the vessel − to which you referred just now − or of any plans to monitor the risk of contamination being released from its cargo? Four, the European Commission has opened an inquiry. Is this to establish whether the competent authorities breached the Community rules in force? If so, Mr Barrot, if there has been a breach of Community law, please give this House an undertaking that you will refer those infringements to the Court of Justice of the European Communities, because when all is said and done it is always citizens and the environment who pay.

Mr President, a point of order. The Commissioner referred to the waters of Gibraltar. I do not know whether this was an interpreting mistake or a lapse on the part of the Commissioner. I would like him to be clear about this because, as he perfectly well knows, the ownership of those waters is the subject of a dispute between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom. I would like him to clarify this, please.

 Madam President, an essential aspect of the revision of the rules on the Structural Funds, which the Committee on Regional Development has carried out successfully, was to make the promotion of territorial cooperation the priority objective of our cohesion policy, whose funding, I note, was increased by the European Parliament as part of the negotiations on the financial perspective. Because of this the calling of this debate cannot come as a surprise to anyone: it was unanimously called for by the political Groups, and I am opening it on behalf of the Regional Development Committee. I thank the Commissioner for attending and regret that the Council has been unable to join us in a debate which affects it directly. Drawing on the experience we gained during the years of the INTERREG Programmes we can conclude that the absence of an initiative-taking structure with its own legal personality has hindered its effectiveness, and we welcome the Commission proposal to establish European groupings of territorial cooperation as instruments with their own legal personality. In a united Europe of States and citizens, regions, as the Treaty of Lisbon says, have their highest form of expression in these bodies. Admittedly, even when under examination by the Council a number of Member States expressed reservations about the usefulness of European groupings of territorial cooperation. It is up for debate whether the nature and content of the regulation as adopted are too vague, and whether it introduced a degree of legal uncertainty by making its application subject to domestic law in too many instances. It might be said that the way that some Member States deal with a complex situation depends on their degree of decentralisation, which requires them to identify strategies in the field of territorial cooperation. However, it should be noted that Regulation 1082/2006 was adopted in July 2006, one year after it was adopted unanimously by the European Parliament on a proposal from our colleague Jan Olbrycht, and has been binding in all Member States since 1 August 2007. The Member States therefore had six months to make the necessary legislative arrangements. According to the information available, however, and the Commissioner will correct me if I am wrong, not even ten Member States have taken the necessary measures to ensure that the regulation has full effect now. It is common knowledge that it is the European Commission’s duty and responsibility to ensure effective implementation of European law and to intervene to remove barriers which may hinder its implementation. Explanations, suggested informally, that the principle of subsidiarity prevents measures being taken against defaulting States will not be accepted: if they were, the Member States could delay or refuse to implement any Community legislation which they viewed as inappropriate or subject to challenge. Therefore, Mrs Hübner, through our question to the European Commission we demand that Parliament should be clearly informed of the problems encountered by the Member States in the implementation of this regulation. Which Member States are not introducing the measures necessary for this regulation to be implemented appropriately, and what measures has the European Commission taken or is it considering taking, specifically initiation of infringement proceedings before the European Court of Justice to ensure that all Member States comply with the regulation and to prevent the funds allocated being jeopardised by some States’ inability to comply with the established rules?

 Prime Minister, I must echo the words of welcome expressed by all my colleagues in my Group in an act of respect and parliamentary courtesy which I very much feel has not been extended by the PSE Group. Prime Minister, we Spanish Members should also be flattered because you have come here today, before reporting to the Spanish Parliament on the result of the Lisbon Council, something which you no doubt plan to do, before the Spanish Parliament is dissolved, because you must agree that the Spanish people deserve an explanation given that, as you have mentioned, they were the first to have a referendum on a Constitution that still does not exist. Prime Minister, the pro-European commitment of your speech is fully shared by the vast majority of this House. That is why I would imagine that now, from Europe and towards Spain, as you have said, you will share our concern that Spain has been the worst in Europe for transposing the Community directives into national law and yet has been in the lead in terms of proceedings for infringements of EU laws. Likewise, I have to say that your commitments here today on the environment – which can only deserve praise – contrast with the harsh reality of the facts, because just today we have heard about a European Commission report which indicates that our country is the one that is furthest from meeting the targets laid down in the Kyoto Protocol. Prime Minister, I cannot wish you luck in the elections next March. It is true that your speech was more like a campaign speech than anything else, but I do want you, and this is the crux of the matter, to do your utmost to re-establish the consensus between the Spanish political forces in the European institutions which has disappeared, Prime Minister, not due to initiatives which have come from this side of the ...

Madam President, I understand the difficulty of the undertaking, and I acknowledge and commend the work done by the rapporteurs. However, on some points the proposal for the distribution of seats that they make is, in my opinion, too discretionary and also does not take sufficient account of the necessary institutional balance inherited from the current Treaty of Nice. Some MEPs have therefore signed amendments that will be submitted to the plenary tomorrow and which, I would like to stress, fully respect the principle of degressive proportionality; and also in our view, they objectivise the allocation of seats for the future, linking it to clear and transparent criteria. One of these amendments, which I should like to focus on, which would enter into force in the 2009 elections, is in line with one of the most prudent studies produced by the Spanish Government and sent to Parliament and the Council. As you will understand, ladies and gentlemen, I am not guilty of defending the proposals of the current Spanish Government for partisan reasons, but what is true is that, in this case, the demographic factor is taken into greater account, and it should be considered to be essential in shaping the institution that represents the interests of the people. Therefore, Madam President, I would ask the rapporteurs to take them into consideration, and my fellow members to vote for them, and in any case, I hope that they will be submitted, defended and taken into account by the European Council when it makes its decision next week.

 Mr President, in recent years we have made a sad tradition of the September part-session in Strasbourg as a discussion of natural disasters. There can be no doubt this is an exceptional time in terms of material damage and lives lost, especially after the terrible fires in Greece, but also in other European regions. First and foremost, we must declare our solidarity with the Greek authorities, with the Greek people as a whole, but most particularly with the families of those who died, who do not always receive the support they deserve. European citizens, however, are entitled to demand a little more of their institutions: flexible application of the European Solidarity Fund, certainly, as Commissioner Špidla has explained, which has not always been the case, but also some specific decisions. We must therefore ask the Council what else has to happen before it dawns on it that work is needed to reform an obsolete fund. I feel I must remind the House that the European Commission proposal and amendments by the European Parliament were submitted to it over a year ago, and so my group wishes to ask the Portuguese Presidency to seriously consider calling an extraordinary meeting of the Council to this end. On another point, although still in relation to the passive attitude of the Council, my group wishes to ask the European Commission to submit specific Community proposals concerning civil protection, along the lines of the Barnier Report. Mr President, my group has played an active role in the negotiations on a joint resolution, and we support it unreservedly. I am sure that no one will exploit this debate now to meddle in the Greek election campaign because I am sure that we all agree there is nothing more despicable than attempting to extract political gain from human misfortune.

 Madam President, it is terrible that we once again have to talk about natural disasters, this time the fires that have taken place in some of the Member States. I wish to point out that three years ago there was a disastrous fire in the Huelva area of my region, Andalusia. The following year we had another disastrous fire in Guadalajara province, which claimed 11 lives, and last year, there was another fire, on a similarly huge scale, in Galicia. Let me tell you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that Parliament took action in response. It sent delegations not only to my country but also to all the Member States concerned. These delegations had a major social impact and we were left with the hope that the EU, with its expressions of solidarity, would be capable of responding effectively. In the committee that I have the honour of chairing, we have worked hard, in conjunction with the Commission, to reform the Solidarity Fund in such a way that it can be adapted to current circumstances, because, ladies and gentlemen, it is virtually impossible to mobilise the Solidarity Fund in the event of fires. The Council gave Mr Barnier – former Commissioner for Regional Policy and now Minister in the French Government – the task of drawing up a report to create a European civil protection force. The report was very well received and was presented to a specially convened public hearing here in this Chamber. The reality is that the German Presidency refused to address this issue and we now hope that the Portuguese Presidency will succeed in persuading their colleagues in the Council to take into account the proposal they have on the table, which was drawn up by the Commission and amended by Parliament. I feel, Madam President, that we must initiate proactive joint action on the part of both the Commission and Parliament, because this is what the European citizens demand, and because it is our responsibility and our obligation. I can assure you that my group will try to ensure that this will tie in perfectly with the resolution that we will adopt in September.

Mr President, we must undoubtedly congratulate Chancellor Merkel and, in particular, the President of the European Commission, who is now having his second big success, following the approval of the financial perspective, because we have avoided a certain risk of crisis. Many Members of this House may have hoped for more, but we must acknowledge that this agreement is perfectly consistent with the Community method. I am convinced that we are going to carry on functioning perfectly well until 2014 or, in exceptional circumstances, for three further years, with the decision-making procedure adopted in Nice which, in the end — I would like to point out — was approved precisely in order to deal with enlargement. Furthermore, I hope that, in order to round off the institutional package, the twenty seats remaining in the European Parliament will be filled for the 2009 elections, naturally, and adhering strictly to the proportionality criteria, that is to say, that it be done in an entirely democratic way. Along the lines of the progress made in the field of justice and home affairs, I wonder whether the opportunity could be taken at the IGC to provide the European Counter-Terrorism Coordinator with content and duties. I believe that this post responds to an objective need and to a great sensitivity amongst the European citizens, as the latest Eurobarometer indicates. Incidentally, I am sure that the European Commission’s services will ensure that the terrorist group ETA is called by its proper name. In the same vein, I am delighted by the mention in the final point of the conclusions of the peace process in Northern Ireland, but I am also surprised to see that there is not the least reference to the threat to the European citizens, and to the Spanish citizens in particular, represented by the breaking of ETA’s ceasefire. Any opportunity to express the European institutions' solidarity with people whose freedom and lives are in danger every day is a good opportunity.

I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Böge on his excellent French, of which I am very envious, and also, of course, the rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, on his efforts to stimulate a crucial debate. We will see later whether the other Community institutions have the courage to tackle it. I believe that almost all of us share the report’s fundamental objectives: a European system that is comprehensible to the citizens and which does not increase fiscal pressure, of course. Nevertheless, I would like to focus on one of the Committee on Regional Development's priority demands, which is that solidarity should remain the fundamental pillar of European integration, particularly following the latest enlargements. Economic, social and territorial cohesion requires a fair and balanced system of funding which takes account, on the one hand, of relative prosperity, and, on the other, of the Member States’ contribution capacity. That requires that we eliminate the regressive elements of the current system, that the rebates received from the Community budget by the most prosperous countries be removed, and that, as the report proposes, the future of own resources be based on the criteria of equity and progressiveness. The benefits of European policies, Madam President, cannot be measured in terms of calculations of net balances that do not take account, for example, of inter-Community trade balances. Finally, I believe that the central element of future European funding must be contributions according to the gross national product of the Member States.

Mr President, Mrs Lehtomäki has called the Sakharov Prize into question and I would like to say to her that the Women in White are defenceless women, wives, mothers and daughters of Cuban political dissidents, who make a huge effort to come from many different Cuban towns to meet peacefully and silently on Sundays and to walk together through the streets of Havana dressed in white. They were doing so this Sunday, when they suffered harassment, threats and insults from people who saw fit to celebrate human rights day in that way. It is absurd for me to have to point out that these women are not dangerous counter-revolutionary terrorists funded by the CIA, but simply women who are not willing to give in to injustice and the trampling of their most fundamental rights as human beings. It is therefore also ridiculous that the Cuban regime should still not be allowing some of its representatives to leave the country to receive the Sakharov Prize that the European Parliament awarded to them last year. We do not know what has happened with the efforts that the President of this Parliament promised to make a year ago now, but if he has done anything, then its results are plain to see. I am therefore pleased with the initiative by Mrs Flautre and Mr Brok to send a delegation to the island. Personally, I would not be opposed to that delegation also taking advantage of that trip to talk with the country’s authorities and hence to gauge the changing political climate. I would however call upon the European Parliament’s services immediately to begin the formal procedures for requesting the relevant permits for entry into the country. I would also call upon the Commission and the Council to apply all the pressure it can to ensure that those permits are granted. If the response is favourable, as I hope it will be, we could express a minimum but effective degree of solidarity. If it is negative, however, Mr President, then that would demonstrate the attitude of the current Cuban Government, something of which the European institutions should take very good note.

Mr President, without going into the underlying causes, over recent years several countries have been suffering serious natural disasters. Particularly in the summer, we have suffered fires, floods and the effects of a particularly severe drought. We frequently see how the affected regions of the Member States, sometimes of the most developed ones, lack sufficient resources to deal with these phenomena themselves. Nevertheless, it sometimes seems that we are more conscientious about offering our solidarity when the damage is done thousands of kilometres away than we are when it is done in a Member State. Despite all of this, the Council appears to be sticking to a passive approach. Some people will say that no more money should be spent, but it is not a financial issue, and one example of this is that you, representatives of the Council, are not making any progress on the reform of the European Solidarity Fund, which will not cost a single additional euro from the Community budget. Sometimes we are in no position to criticise. Plenary approved the sending of a delegation to the most affected regions at the beginning of September, and, Mr President, Parliament’s Bureau is still tied up with regulatory issues that it has to sort out before it can give the green light to that delegation. We shall not lose heart, however, because nobody believes that we should not provide resources for a common effort that will make us more effective when it comes to helping people. The principle of subsidiarity will be respected as well. There is no intention of impinging on the sovereignty of any Member State. There is a report, for which Mr Barnier is responsible, on the table in the Council, which provides a good basis for this work. I would like to know whether the Council intends to pursue this issue.
 The European Parliament will undoubtedly give its enthusiastic support, and Europeans will be grateful for that.

Mr President, Mr Schulz, I was naturally not here on Monday when the European Commission spoke. In his statement, Commissioner Dimas said that the only country in which the European civil protection mechanism was applied this summer was Spain. That makes sense, because 50% of the fires this summer have unfortunately taken place in my country. Now, Mr Schulz will know that on 6 October in the European Parliament we will hold a public hearing, proposed by our friend the ex-Commissioner Mr Barnier, precisely on the European civil protection corps. Since we want that delegation to travel before 6 October, therefore, it is physically impossible to visit all of the countries that he has mentioned. I propose that the visit to Spain before 6 October go ahead as planned and, if his group wants us to visit other countries after 6 October, he has my assurance that I will vote in favour of that.

Mr President, the Commission is here today to attend this debate in the European Parliament on the initiative of my group and I would therefore like to begin by thanking the other groups that have supported this initiative, thereby making it possible for us to hold this debate today. I would, of course, also like to thank the Commissioner for being here and above all for his work and commitment in this field. Nevertheless, certain Members have told us quite legitimately that we are doing the same as we did a year ago, that we are in the same situation as last summer. I would like to respond to them by saying that that is not true: it is true that we debated fires in September last year as well; it is true that we visited the areas affected together with some of our fellow Members who are here today – and not without difficulties created by certain bodies in this House, incidentally; and it is true that we held a hearing in which victims’ families were able to express themselves in an emotional manner to all of us, but we are not in the same situation, because, since then, the European Parliament has presented clear and concrete initiatives and proposals to the Council. For example, within the framework of the Berend report, this House approved a raft of amendments aimed at updating the European Union’s Solidarity Fund. We have also asked the European Commission for a specific directive on fires and on drought, since there is a directive on floods, and we have asked the Council for a committed response to the report by former Commissioner Barnier, which was presented at the last European Council, as everybody knows. We are not, therefore, and nor should we be, in the same situation as a year ago. We have a package of proposals which should make us much more effective in combating fires. What we have not had is a reaction from the Council, and that fact can be attributed as much to the Presidencies we have had this year, which have done practically nothing, as to those Member States most affected that have not asked for anything. Certain competent public authorities use the drought, or the deliberately caused fires, as an excuse for this failure. It is true that there is drought and it is true that there are criminals, as there have been in the past, but we should be asking those authorities what they have done this year in the field of prevention and whether, when the inevitable has happened, there has been proper coordination inside and outside of their borders. For example, the Commissioner referred to the most significant fire of this summer: the one that took place in Galicia. I would like to ask you when you formally received the request for assistance from the Spanish Government, and on precisely what date you were formally asked to activate the civil protection mechanism. Ladies and gentlemen, we are simply asking for more prevention and more coordination. We are not talking about inventing resources or funds that do not exist. We are simply asking that the European Union’s Solidarity Fund be applied, which would have been much easier, by the way, if the European Parliament’s proposals had been taken into account. Nor are we asking for greater powers for the European Union, but rather for more planning and more coordination while fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity. Let us see whether, while helping those who most need it now, we can ensure that we do not have to repeat this debate next year.

Mr President, I would like in particular to congratulate the four rapporteurs for the regional Funds, and not merely out of courtesy, but because they have done an excellent job, with tenacity and skill, the result of which has been the incorporation of many amendments into the final text, of which the Council has already expressed its approval. It has been an honour for me to lead these debates and hence to be a direct witness to that success. It is a pity that the governments of certain Member States have been intransigent and that the Council has not been able to accept the institutional declaration, which is exclusively intended to open up a debate on the excesses of the cohesion policy. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the discussions in the Council last December on the financial perspective and now on the Regulations on the funds, we have begun to fear that certain governments wish to call into question the most visible and successful of the European policies: the cohesion policy. I am convinced that the huge majority of Europeans are in favour of solidarity and that our Parliament, always hand in hand with the European Commission – and I would like in particular to acknowledge the work of Commissioner Hübner – will be the guarantor of this essential pillar of European integration and structuring.

Mr President, illegal immigration has become one of the European Union’s major challenges. In Spain, for example, according to all the opinion polls, it is seen as the country’s second biggest problem. I would therefore have liked to have heard the Austrian Presidency say something more decisive, more ambitious and more concrete about the progress you expect from the next European Council in this field. Besides the provision in the draft Constitution, we could – and in my view we should – continue to make progress on the communitisation of measures to combat illegal immigration. I am well aware that some people will say that certain governments take decisions against the wishes of their European partners, ignoring the Commission, and then, when problems arise, they want them to be resolved amongst all of us. I would like to say to those people, however, that, with a Community policy on immigration, there would never be mass regularisation without control, and the 'pull factor' which we are currently so afraid of would not therefore exist. Legal immigrants must be guaranteed integration and equal rights and obligations. By the way, we could consider transitional measures for Romanian and Bulgarian citizens who – I too am sure – will soon be Community citizens. Moving on to other issues, the Presidency referred in passing to the document requested of Michel Barnier. Since last summer, Parliament has done a lot of work on natural disasters; we have visited the areas affected and, as noted in a resolution approved practically unanimously, we have seen great dissatisfaction in society and too little coordination amongst the competent administrations. Finally, I would like to say that you have not said anything about the Regulation on the Funds. One detail remains to be resolved, Mr President, so that Parliament can vote for it during the first week of July. Your colleagues can tell you about it, but I would ask you to make a final effort and I wish you the best of luck.

Mr President, over the last eight months we have visited the areas affected by natural disasters in many of the Member States and we have held a public hearing at which some of the people who have not had the opportunity to speak in their own national Parliaments have been able to speak. Today we are presenting concrete proposals, which the other institutions cannot allow to be thrown into the litter bin. Some Members could legitimately be pleased with the work done in this area. It is more than the public administrations directly responsible in some of the Member States have done. Nevertheless, I believe that we should ask ourselves whether we are more prepared now than we were eight months ago to prevent and combat this kind of disaster and whether we now have more effective mechanisms for helping those suffering the consequences of fire, water or drought. I am not sure. In any event, I would like to thank all of the parliamentary groups for their commitment and dedication over these months of intensive work. I would like to thank the President of the European Parliament for taking an interest in who was going to attend the hearing, although I must admit that I would have preferred him to show his support by immediately visiting the areas affected, avoiding the bureaucratic procedures that delayed us for four months and resulting in us missing the opportunity to demonstrate the solidarity of all of us – I am sure – with the victims straightaway. I would like in particular to thank Parliament’s services for the professionalism they have shown. They were subject to all kinds of pressures before, during and after the visits made. I am delighted that we have been able to vote on these reports at the same time as the reform of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund, because we have noted general dissatisfaction with the application of this Community instrument in each and every place we have visited, Mr Piebalgs. I believe it to be essential that the Council accept Parliament’s amendments, in particular those that demand, on the one hand, that the Fund assist all of the victims and their families, and on the other, that the Fund’s limits of applicability be reduced and that this Fund can be applied when certain areas are completely destroyed, as in the case of Riba de Saelices, which we have visited. Ladies and gentlemen, on these visits we have seen the deficiencies in the information campaigns aimed at prevention and the lack of coordination amongst the competent public administrations in the Member States, including, as we have seen, in Pampillosa da Serra, for example. We have also seen the dissatisfaction of the population in broad sectors of society, in NGOs and amongst representatives of civil society. I therefore hope that the proposals contained in the reports being submitted for Parliament’s consideration today receive wide support and send a clear signal to the governments of the Member States. I would like quickly to summarise what we are asking for by means of ten points. First: a European strategy to combat natural disasters; secondly: the involvement of regions and local bodies; thirdly: flexibility in the redistribution of the funds available; fourthly: a Community forest-fire protection programme; fifthly: a specific proposal, Mr Piebalgs, for a directive for fire prevention and management in the European Union; sixthly: that the Seventh Framework Research Programme, the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security and the Galileo system be applied in order to assist in prevention and early warning; seventhly: information and educational programmes and campaigns agreed with the Member States; eighthly: a Community civil protection mechanism; ninthly: that additional financial instruments also be applied, such as EIB loans or State aid for regional purposes; and tenthly: that the European Parliament continue to carry out its duty of control with regard to the shortcomings in the fight against fire and all of the problems relating to it. For all of these reasons, I would call upon everybody to put aside the party-political differences that may have divided us so that we can create a broad parliamentary consensus, which is what the European citizens are demanding of us and which we owe in particular to those who have suffered the consequences of these natural disasters: their victims.

Mr President, Minister, almost twenty years ago, with the Single European Act, when we opened up our borders in order to create a European Economic Area, we also decided to establish a series of financial mechanisms to help the least-developed countries to adapt their economic structures to free competition. From that moment, cohesion became a fundamental pillar of Europe, consolidating in the financial perspectives negotiated in 1992 and 1999. The results of that policy have been extraordinary. As Minister Straw acknowledged a few days ago, on presenting the British Presidency’s proposal, there has been a similar increase in the commercial flows benefiting the most developed Member States and it is therefore perfectly clear that the net contributors’ budgetary deficit with the European Union is in line with the trade surplus of those countries compared to the cohesion countries. It is therefore clear that the cohesion policy ― certainly the most effective of all Community policies ― benefits all the countries of the European Union, allowing for the true convergence of the least advantaged regions within a relatively short space of time. Minister, the British Presidency is therefore violating that cohesion policy, which means that the financial costs of enlargement will have to be met by the least-developed territories of the European Union, despite the fact that it is the richest that benefit most from enlargement. In line with the views approved by the European Parliament, therefore, the Council must be very aware that it cannot assume that it will have parliamentary support for a proposal such as the one that the British Presidency is putting forward at the moment. And if the Council approves it, I will of course do everything possible to ensure that Parliament vetoes it.

Madam Commissioner, without going into detail, the facts are as follows: you asked the College of Commissioners for support, which is an exceptional situation. The President of the Commission went to Madrid on a secret trip and shortly afterwards you withdrew that point from the agenda of the College of Commissioners. The following week you made the College of Commissioners decide on an issue with hardly any debate. In the mean time, a colleague of yours from the European Commission keeps making statements in Spain stating in advance what the European Commission’s position was going to be. And I am wondering, and I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you are aware that, in one Member State, these events have led to a loss of credibility for the European Commission as a guardian of the Community interest.

Mr President, as the Commissioner responsible for the environment has pointed out, this summer we in the European Union have been the victims of disasters caused by fire and by water, and while some regions are seriously threatened by gradual desertification, others are living in fear of floods. This is a demonstration of European diversity and of the need to be sensitive to the realities faced by others. In several countries of the south of Europe, the fires have led to the loss of dozens of human lives, the evacuation of entire populations and extraordinary environmental damage. It is true that we are suffering a year of drought, but I believe that it is unacceptable to resign ourselves to fate. On the contrary, it is our responsibility to analyse the underlying causes of the disasters that are repeated year after year, and to find out what we are doing wrong or, quite simply, what we are failing to do. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore proposes the creation of a temporary committee in our Parliament. That committee should assess which concrete measures we could adopt in Europe to complement those that are being implemented in the Member States. Fire does not stop at national borders, and we should therefore create a European protocol for fighting fires; we should at least consider creating a specific European agency and – why not? – specialised cross-border bodies. Commissioner, twenty-four hours is sometimes too long. Without prejudice to the role of the European Solidarity Fund, I believe it would be a mistake to restrict ourselves to seeking funds every time we suffer a fire. We must go further: for example, the European Commission, with the support of the Council, has removed the aid to farmers for the creation, clearing and monitoring of firebreaks, and that is something that should perhaps be reconsidered. Mr President, these are some of the proposals we could evaluate in this temporary committee that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats proposes be created in our Parliament.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, in particular Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Fava and Mr Andria, whose work we have been able to follow closely in the Committee on Regional Development, which has been intimately involved in the debate. They have offered a wonderful example of dedication, compromise and a will to seek agreement. I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Hübner, because his determination that our legislative work should make progress has helped us to overcome the discouragement that followed the failure of the last Council. I hope that the vote in plenary tomorrow will be correctly understood by the Council as a demonstration of the European Parliament’s determination that the cohesion policy should continue to be built upon an essential pillar of European integration. I would like to draw the British Presidency’s attention to this because some may take the view that by opening up very general debates — though they are undoubtedly very important — we could end up failing to conclude anything. There is no need to point out that it is already too late for the Commission to draw up the programmes implementing the Funds by January 2007. If we had to wait until spring next year for the Council to reach an agreement, the Commission would not be able to go ahead with the first payments until 2009, which would be dramatic for the cohesion policy in general and in particular for the new Member States, to whom the United Kingdom has always expressed its commitment. I believe that the European Parliament’s contributions will be acceptable, in particular the compromises on such sensitive issues as the N+2 rule, VAT or the statistical effect. Mr President, the three institutions have the responsibility to tackle the negotiations over the coming months with a determination to reach agreement, because we cannot, and must not, allow any further failure.

Madam President, I hope that Minister Schmit can hear me, because I would like to say that what the citizens are demanding now, quite rightly, is greater transparency. I believe that the President of your government was expressing everybody's feelings when he said quite clearly that he felt ashamed. It is incredible that certain Member States should make all kinds of statements of a Europeanist nature, saying that they want more Europe inside and outside our borders, while at the same time they demand a drastic reduction in their contribution to the Union’s budgets. It is not acceptable for certain governments to complain about their net contribution to the European Union without taking account of their commercial balance with the other Member States. The case of Germany in relation to certain Member States, such as my own, Spain, speaks volumes. Germany's net deficit with the European Union is less than my country’s commercial deficit with, in fact, Germany. Neither is it acceptable, Mr Schmit, that certain Heads of Government should say one thing within the Council and then say something quite different to the media in their countries. I would therefore like to ask whether it is true that there have even been certain Member States that have promised their support in the final vote and have then changed their minds and voted against. I would ask you to respond. It is precisely because of cases such as this, and regardless of what is laid down in the draft Constitutional Treaty, that debates in the Council must be made transparent, however shameful they may be. Finally, Minister, I would like to wish you the best of luck on the 10th.

I am pleased with the position adopted by the European Parliament on the financial perspectives and I now only hope that the Council will do its duty and reach an agreement on the 17th. But several of us have abstained on a matter of principle, and that is that we do not accept –– not even hypothetically –– any reopening of the 2002 agreement on the common agricultural policy. We want it to remain closed until 2013, as has been agreed.

Mr President, the European Commission’s proposal represented a commitment to enlargement and, at the same time, to its aspirations to turn our economy into a centre of growth and development, to overcome the technological gap with the United States, to increase our presence on the world stage and to confront the new challenges of terrorism and organised crime. And this is despite the fact that the proposed distribution of the costs of enlargement is neither fair nor balanced, as demonstrated during the parliamentary debate, and that is why we have presented an amendment that I hope will be supported by a majority of the House tomorrow. While I applaud the efforts being made by the Luxembourg Presidency, I must express my concern about the direction of some of its proposals, which tend to please the Member States whose attitude is the least flexible to the detriment of others. The Council would do well to take account of the clear signals being sent by the European Parliament, particularly with regard to cohesion policy. We want sufficient funds, we want the reuse of funds left over from the convergence objective by the countries with the greatest capacity for absorption, and I hope that tomorrow we will approve an amendment calling for political compensation for those countries and regions suffering a sudden loss of funds. Mr Schmit’s fine words, for which we are certainly grateful, must be translated into a clear commitment to cohesion. Thinking realistically, I believe that we all agree that the Union currently lacks political leadership, but what will be put to the test on the 17th is the ability of the Heads of State or Government to do their duty. And it would be profoundly irresponsible on the part of the Council not to reach an agreement at this time.

Madam President, the enlargement of the European Union incorporating 10 new States was unquestionably an extraordinary event in our shared history. At no point during those negotiations, which were clearly not easy, did any country put their national interests before what some people describe as the reunification of Europe, however legitimate they may have been. This is demonstrated by the fact that the most difficult chapters of that negotiation were concluded during the Spanish Presidency of the Union, which until then had been the biggest net receiver of funds. It has been calculated that the enlargement has cost as much as EUR 200 000 million. During this debate the European Commission has been called upon to explain how it proposes to distribute this sum amongst the 15 old Member States. Because the confirmed information that we have had access to demonstrates that the European Commission's proposal in this regard is not fair. Is it not the case that it is proposed that Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece pay a sum that, compared to their GDP, is three times the Union average, is much greater than that proposed for all the net contributors and, for example, is four times the sum proposed for Germany? If that is the case, Commissioner, the European Commission has the responsibility to propose, within the negotiations on the renewal of the financial perspectives, a compensation mechanism for these countries to alleviate the effects of the sharp fall in their net income from the Union and thus to prevent any risk to their process of true convergence.

Mr Juncker has described a very ambitious agenda for these next six months; this agenda offers a great opportunity, but is also a great responsibility for Luxembourg and particularly for its Prime Minister, who has both experience and ability and whom we wish every success in this difficult task. I would like to make a few comments on the greatest challenge for this Presidency, which, in my opinion, will be the reform of the financial perspectives, which you, Mr Juncker, mentioned in passing. It will probably be the most essential element, on the basis of which these six months will be assessed. It is clear that success or failure depends not only upon the actions of the Presidency, but it is the case that during this time the Luxembourg Government will have to employ all its determination, and I am pleased that you have stated this morning that you will ensure that the general interest is put first, because, as you have said yourself, to reach July without an agreement would spell financial chaos for the European Union. In order to be successful, the Presidency will have to seek compromises; I believe that these compromises will have to be based on two fundamentals: on the one hand, the validity of the principle of cohesion, as stated by the Council at the end of the Swedish Presidency, and, on the other, balance in the distribution of burdens. I hope that over the next six months this House can learn the cost of enlargement to the original fifteen Member States, because on the objective basis of figures it is possible to make proposals that the European citizens in each Member State can understand and accept. On the subject of the citizens, and going beyond what is laid down in the Treaties, I would like to ask the Presidency what role it intends the European Parliament, which is going to give its opinion in May, to play in this negotiation?

The President of the European Commission made certain comments last week – and a colleague has pointed this out today – to the effect that more Europe cannot be created with less money. Today, Commissioner, you have confirmed that the current Commission is maintaining the proposal of the previous Commission. I would add – to those people who are constantly claiming to be Europeanists – that less money means the renationalisation of the cohesion policy, which is equivalent to less Europe. Nevertheless, the Commission will probably soon propose amendments depending on how the negotiations develop. And I am sure that the Commission’s proposals will be based on the principle of balance. I would, therefore, like to ask the European Commission to review the aspects of its proposal which could lead to unfair results because of their lack of balance, Commissioner. Because I believe that to a certain extent that is what is happening at this point in the negotiations. In order to provide material for this debate – either endorsing it or rejecting it – I would call on the European Commission to make public in this House the information available to it on the impact on the fifteen Member States of the costs of enlargement – which, of course, is absolutely essential – because the intention to pay for the convergence requirements of our new partners at the expense of solidarity with the countries and regions of the existing States would be profoundly anti-European and harmful to our shared future. I shall end by expressing my support for the European Commission, provided that it maintains the Cohesion Policy as a fundamental pillar of European integration.

Mr President, this is the first debate on the financial perspectives and, therefore, I hope that we will have another opportunity when the chairman of our parliamentary committee can participate. The question today focuses on certain issues on which there is undoubtedly no fundamental neutrality: firstly, the participation of the European Parliament, as several Members have stressed, such as Mr Böge – and I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his statement of good intentions – and, secondly, the working timetable. For many reasons, Mr President, whether the work ends in an agreement in 2005 or in 2006 is important because, if we are obliged to defer the budget, as the Commissioner responsible for the budget acknowledged yesterday, it will be the cohesion policy that pays the price. I would, therefore, like to draw the attention of certain Members to the risk to solidarity in the European Union of having an unjustified showdown between the European Parliament and the other institutions. We would like to reach an agreement during the Luxembourg Presidency. I would, therefore, like the Dutch Presidency to tell us how work is going on approving the general lines of the reform at the European Council on the 17 December. We are delighted that the Presidency has said that the basis for this debate will be the European Commission's proposal, but how do those of you who claim to be Europeanists intend to deal with the cost of enlargement, expand internal and external Community policies and at the same time reduce the European Union's budgetary spending? I do not know whether you have a magic wand or the capacity to perform miracles, or whether perhaps you intend to destroy cohesion for the old Member States, in other words, make the poor regions of the statistically or genuinely rich countries meet the cost of the economic development of the poor regions of the new Member countries. You have less than two weeks to answer these questions if you do not want the Dutch Presidency to be tarnished at the end of its term in office. You should start thinking about how to justify wanting more Europe while spending less money, because nobody understands that. What we do understand very well is that less money means less Europe.

 Mr President, esteemed Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I want to thank the Prime Minister of Spain for his thoughts on the direction of the European Union. It is true that we would have preferred his speech and his thoughts on Europe to have been given at another time, before and not after the Lisbon Summit, and specifically not seventy-two hours after his appointment as Prime Minister, because these circumstances are never beneficial to achieving the real objective of such a meeting. However, ladies and gentlemen, at the same time it would be unfair of me – and our Group would not want this – if I did not thank the Prime Minister for or rightly value his contribution which is without doubt very useful in terms of the future direction of Europe. It is not easy for me to speak on behalf of the PPE-DE Group on freedom and the European Union, basically because there have been personal experiences in my Group which so typify the defence of freedom and which are so recent in their occurrence that I cannot find sufficient or adequate words to explain the deep and real meaning of the European Union for our Group. Our Group is delighted at the definite progress made at the Lisbon Summit but, at the same time, we would be lying if we did not say that our Group considers that we still do not have sufficient political momentum and ambition to transform the European Union of today into the European Union that we need for the future of the European people. We cannot achieve the Europe we need if we do not believe in ourselves. We cannot complete the European Union with inertia or fine words or simply from common ground. Words such as coherence and authenticity are not enough, for example, when tackling the transposition of European directives or complying with the Kyoto Protocol. Prime Minister, what is missing is undoubtedly determination, defence of our values and effort. It is these elements that will enable us to consolidate the moral strength of the Union and, ultimately, its own culture which is what our project essentially stands for. However, we must make our European citizens aware of these missing elements. We must tell them about these and clearly explain them. We must share with them this political need for effort and dare to tell them the truth about what is missing. They will not be discouraged by this but will, in fact, provide the hopes, dreams and proximity that we so desperately need. We must tell them more clearly what the problems are. We must prioritise these and work on these urgent issues to find a way to distribute powers between the European Union and the European nations, without generalising, but instead by prioritising and identifying the most urgent problems that remain. Prime Minister, agreement, consensus and a gradual approach have been the traditional European methods, because consensus is a method more than a value. This means that we must define and organise this consensus and, at the same time, we have to empower the European political groups, because there will be no European Union without European political parties. This also means that we should not bring to this House any national disagreements or dissensions (which are real and deep), as were regrettably brought from Spain some months ago, as you well know. Prime Minister, there are problems that require a European solution. This without doubt strengthens the Union but, in the opinion of our Group, it also strengthens the European nations. The Union will not grow stronger as the European nations grow weaker, but in fact totally the opposite: the European Union, in order to be completed, needs its members to be strong and it will be impossible to complete this project with weakened nations which threaten its territorial integrity. The value of freedom is what unites us. This is the value to end all values and it is these values which are set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that will be signed on 12 December in Strasbourg. However, this is not just an illusion: it is a renewed commitment to freedom, and not just in the territory of our Union, but particularly in the territory of our friends with whom we have traditionally shared our culture, in Latin America and also in some republics of eastern Europe. It is in these countries too that we must try to consolidate our framework of principles and values. I have one further thing to say: coherence rather than words. History has proven the beneficial effect of our culture on the world. We should pass it on and, at the same time, be aware that we cannot lock up this value within our European Union.

Mr President, I would like to start by saying that the fight is not against the phenomenon of terrorism. In each case the fight is against a particular organisation that has a particular political agenda and specific political objectives. We therefore need to start by naming the terrorist organisation that we are faced with, and at the moment, the fundamental future risk facing the European Union is a jihadist terrorist organisation, which is not a phenomenon but rather an organisation that has already overcome the fear of carrying out attacks on our continent. The difference between this organisation and other traditional organisations that have struck at and are striking at the European Union, is that it is still very much an unknown quantity, because we do not understand the rhythm of attacks or the reason behind the choice of countries, and because their sense of timing is significantly different from ours. Because of this, as Mr Watson expressed so well, the task of the EU’s institutions is not to produce an exhaustive list of measures, but rather it is time to establish the foundations, the pillars and even the fields of operation for the European institutions to play a role in the fight against terrorism. We need to seek direction. In this area it is not about announcing more and more measures. We have to understand that the role of the EU’s institutions should be establishing what we fundamentally need in order to fight this organisation, which is intelligence and information. Therefore, first and foremost we need a European model for fighting this terrorist organisation, because otherwise, in the Europe of 2025, if the European Union does not add value, if it is no good and is neither useful nor recognised as serving Europeans in this fight against terrorism, they will wonder what the point of the European Union is.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Frattini on having quite rightly once again used a term that is crucial at this point in the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice: the term priorities. In this regard, I would like to say that we need a great debate and a great result, which cannot be delayed at this point in the construction of the European Union, because we are often talking about concrete measures, but we need to define what is most important. In one decade, what will be the final objective in terms of the competences of the European Union and the Member States with regard to the two issues that Mr Frattini has mentioned: immigration and radical Islamist terrorism? That debate cannot be postponed, and, until it takes place and until we have a result, we will not be able to make the correct and appropriate progress in these areas. It is a pre-constitutional debate. It is undoubtedly the thing that creates the most fear today amongst Europeans in terms of their future. It is therefore a pre-constitutional debate and therefore, Mr Frattini and representatives of the Council, it is something that cannot be postponed under any circumstances. A European Union in one decade is impossible without an immigration policy. It is impossible to conceive of a United States of America with as many immigration policies as it has States. It is impossible to accept that with regard to an emerging phenomenon such as Islamic terrorism – which has dared to move on from placing bombs on a bus to placing bombs on a plane, from attacking cartoons to directly attacking the Pope, that is, an emerging phenomenon – the European Union and its institutions do not yet have a political role that the citizens can see. It may be little, it may be enough or it may be a lot, but the serious problem is that the European citizens do not know what the European Union does, either in the field of immigration or in the field of terrorism. This is therefore a debate that cannot be postponed. This is the pre-constitutional debate yet to be held and it is the great debate that Europeans will hold over the coming months.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats following this statement on the recent history of Spain. I would like to stress that our position is essentially based on full support for the values of reconciliation and of overcoming a past tragedy, which were the values that inspired the transition to democracy and which led to the 1978 Constitution. On a day like tomorrow, a 5th of July 30 years ago, the President of the Spanish Government, Adolfo Suárez, took on his job of taking our democratic transition forward. For those of us who had the honour and opportunity to assist in that project and to belong to the Union of the Democratic Centre - that party which, in government, was responsible for the material execution of the transition, aided by other political formations and supported unequivocally by Spanish society and His Majesty the King - our values of freedom and reconciliation enshrined in the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and our call for an end to the two irreconcilable Spains arose from our very deepest convictions. The mistake, the stupidity, the tragedy of the last century of Spanish history, was the ease with which the two opposing Spains have been able to re-emerge – an excessive phenomenon that has always existed in our country – the ease with which those two Spains were able to convince themselves that they could not live together democratically. We are all aware of the origin and the raison d’être of the European Union, which is founded upon the same moral strength as that Spanish Constitution, the moral strength of people joining together, the moral strength of unity, so that our recent past will not repeat itself, so that no more world wars will emerge on European soil, no more wars, no more dictatorships, no more communist regimes and no more civil wars like the one we suffered in Spain. The new nations of Europe may make mistakes when dealing with our present and future problems, but there is one mistake that we cannot make, that we do not have the right to make: to repeat historical mistakes, not to learn from the mistakes of our history. For all of these reasons, we must not become tired of reconciliation and harmony. We must not change our attitude, and many Spaniards believe it to be an historical mistake to try to promote a second transition today, as if the first one had grown old and obsolete; it is an historical mistake to unilaterally destroy the essence of our Constitution of harmony; it is historically foolish to introduce the debate on the right to self-determination in Spain, the creation within Spain of new nations that have never existed; it is an historical mistake because it moves us away from the harmony we have created. On this thirtieth anniversary of the Spanish democratic transition, therefore, Mr President, which began on 5 July 1976, and on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, please allow me to end with a 'viva' for reconciliation, a ‘viva’. for freedom and a ‘viva’ for the Spanish Constitution of 1978.

Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hazan, on a report that is undoubtedly accurate and rigorous. I would like to say that the approval of the European Arrest Warrant — and we must never forget this — was not simply the approval of just one more legal instrument, and nor did it merely replace an obsolete extradition system; the reality is that it was a symbol, it was a response and it reflected a new attitude. It was a symbol of the urgent need to create a European judicial and policing space. It was the European response to the terrible September 11 attack on the Twin Towers in New York and, at the same time, it reflected the political attitude that terrorism had to be combated actively and that security had to be tackled by means of an internal European Union policy, one of the great objectives that we should be making a point of pursuing. I must point out that I had the opportunity to present this Warrant during the era when I was in the Council of Ministers and, unfortunately, it was not approved until the 11 September attack happened. It is therefore essential that we do not reintroduce verification of double criminality, that we resolve the various forms of incompatibility with different Constitutions and that the national judges do not introduce supplementary instruments before another attack obliges us urgently and hurriedly to introduce modifications to this extremely important Warrant. There must not therefore be any obstacles or timidity in relation to this issue. Unequivocal will is undoubtedly required, and we must also remember the extremely important work of a Home Affairs Minister of that era, Antoine Duquesne, who is not here today but who played a decisive and crucial role in making it possible for the European Arrest Warrant to be the subject of our debate here this afternoon.

Mr President, Chancellor, there is no question that six months is not sufficient time to demand that the Chancellor resolve the current crisis in Europe by the end of his mandate. Nevertheless, six months may be long enough to point out the appropriate direction for this change and rectification that the European Union requires. I am therefore simply going to talk about two urgent issues which I believe are facing the European Union. Firstly, having heard all of us, Chancellor, you will see that the European Union has no problem with words, since almost all of us are asking for the same thing: more Europe and the incorporation of real problems into the operation of the European Union. The problem is not one of words, but one of attitudes. Every institution must adjust its attitude again and again when dealing with issues affecting Europeans. When the day comes when the European Parliament does not examine what the President-in-Office of the European Council is doing but rather what the Heads of Government that are not holding the Presidency are doing in the Councils, we shall undoubtedly be dealing with one of the problems of the European Union, which is the lack of tenacity, the lack of constant work on the part of all of the governments, even though they may not be holding the Presidency of the European Council. Secondly, Chancellor, within a few years, Europeans are going to have to identify and acknowledge the European Union’s political role in relation to the great problems facing us: energy, immigration, terrorism, growth and employment. At the moment, Europeans do not know what the European Union is doing on any of these issues; they do not evaluate, they do not criticise, they do not judge, because they do not know what the European Union is doing in these areas. We need to do some political work in order to make the public aware of what the European Union and its institutions are doing in these fields. That is the second great urgent issue facing the Union, Chancellor.

Mr President, I am grateful for the Commissioner’s reply, but, having listened to her, I have the impression that, with regard to this matter, only technical issues have been dealt with, when the reality is that this decision has been the subject of many statements and positions prior to the meeting of the two Presidents which are far from normal. You have not referred to the statement of the ministers of the Spanish Government, nor the position of certain Commissioners who are not competent in this field, nor even the request for exclusion from the Socialist Group a week before the decision so that you would not be competent in relation to these issues. Against this extremely unusual background, on the Sunday before the week of the decision, the meeting that previously only you have mentioned took place. A meeting that was not public, which was opaque, which was made public by means of subsequent leaks, thanks to which we found out that the OPA was dealt with. Commissioner, correct procedures are of the greatest importance in our democracy, and you know the saying: ‘Caesar’s wife must not just be honourable, but must appear to be so’. A government of the Union must comply with Community rules, but the foremost rule is common sense in the way this decision is made. The Commission cannot be strong with the weak and weak with the strong. You must not give the impression that you are nothing more than top officials of national governments; your strength is based on the independence and common sense of your decisions. I wonder whether you have obeyed those rules.

Mr President, I would firstly like once again to acknowledge the significance of an excellent speech given today by Mr Tony Blair in the European Parliament. Firstly, because it was a highly political speech and we need political speeches in the European Parliament, because they make a change from our routine and because at the same time they undoubtedly have the capacity for renewal and regeneration, which is something I believe we must not underestimate. We could go on to say many things but we must not in any way undervalue or play down the importance of Mr Blair’s speech this afternoon, nor the speech he made on 23 June of this same year. I would like to say that, above all, I welcome the fact that he identifies certain priorities, certain problems and, at the same time, he indicates what leadership means, that is to say, the capacity to chose, to synthesise and to concentrate the political efforts that the European Union must make. Having said that, what we need is for that list of problems not just to be accepted by Mr Blair, but also by the Council that will take place this weekend in the United Kingdom. Secondly, it should be stressed — and this is what I felt was most lacking in Mr Blair’s speech — that, between the significance of the orientations he has indicated and the actions to be taken, there is an element which he has not mentioned: he must make an effort to define the political role that the European Union must play in relation to these issues, as my colleague Mr Karas pointed out a few minutes ago. Orientations are not enough and actions are not enough. There is an intermediate stage: to define the European Union’s role in the fight against terrorism, in immigration and in universities. And that means an effort by the Council, and the European Council must urge the European Union to give up some of its competences, some of its sovereignty, so that the European Union and its institutions can play the role that unquestionably fall to them. Finally, it is my hope that this excellent speech, which I do not undervalue, will not end in just one more frustration at the end of this six-month Presidency of the European Council.

Mr President, the definition and specification of the rightful political role of the European Union and its institutions in the fight against terrorism is, I believe, an extremely urgent objective for this Presidency of the European Union. What I am saying is not inspired by Europeanism, rather, it is a fundamental need for each of the nations suffering from terrorism. It is needed in order to imbue the Union with real meaning, it is something we all need, all us Europeans, and it is needed because, if the European Union is not able to play a role in the fight against terrorism, the question ‘what is the European Union for?’ will inevitably arise. If, in the face of fear, there is no union, and that is perceived as the European Union's stance, then what is the European Union for? That, of course, would not just be a disaster for the European Union, but would also be a wasted opportunity for the Member States, as they would be unable to use the value added offered by the Union to combat this phenomenon of terrorism. The European Union must be an essential political element in the fight against terrorism, especially for the Home Affairs Ministers. I know these Ministers face many urgent issues, they require many instruments and tools, but I believe one of the main urgent issues for the upcoming European Council is that you, the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, need to be able to promote a European political project and that you need to find the European Union useful and effective in the fight against terrorism, because it is you who are going to need the Union most over the coming years. I am talking about a European Union political project rather than about an exhaustive list of measures which, at the end of the day, we are not able to communicate. It is clear that the European Union must promote measures on biometric data, which was mentioned by Mr Clarke or, undoubtedly, the retention of data or whatever the Home Affairs Ministers require, but we must place the emphasis on the political dimension, on a European political project. We spend a lot of time in this Parliament talking about technical and legal measures, but very little time on the political effort the European Union requires in order to combat terrorism. We cannot carry on putting the cart before the horse; we must provide the European Union’s action with the essential political dimension. So where can we find the European political project? What I mean is that, in the face of Islamist terrorism, the terrorism of those who claim to defend Islam, the terrorism of Al Qaeda, the important thing is for us to understand that this is an emerging phenomenon, about which we know almost nothing. We do not know its rhythm, its timing, or how it chooses which nations to attack. We simply do not understand it. We need a European political project based on information and on intelligence in order to understand the phenomenon and evaluate the organisation we are dealing with. We must be able not just to take measures, but also to ensure that European citizens know and understand what we are doing. We do not devote either time or political effort to explaining what we are about and European citizens are not aware of what the European Union does. They only see national police forces. As far as they are concerned, the European Union plays no part in the fight against terrorism, they do not recognise us, they cannot visualise what we are doing. That is why it is so important to make an effort to create information fora for national police forces, led by the European institutions. We need a European information centre, in which the security forces can access databases such as EURODAC, SIS or VIS. In short, ladies and gentlemen, a political dimension is required. It is not possible to fight against terrorism. To say we are fighting international terrorism means nothing. What we are fighting against is a particular organisation and I am therefore concerned that the leaders of the European institutions dare not call the organisation we are fighting by its name. I do not care whether we talk about Al Qaeda, about Islamist terrorism, about radical or fundamentalist groups, or about groups which claim to defend Islam, but terrorism’s main advantage is its diffuse nature. Clearly, therefore, the European Union must deal head on with a problem of this nature by adopting all the instruments of the rule of law and on the basis of our unequivocal respect for the defence of human rights. That goes without saying.

Prime Minister, I would like to say firstly that I am delighted by what appeared to annoy the Socialist spokesman: that many Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats applauded your speech this morning. Many of us believe that we must not only begin a period of reflection in the European Union, but that we must begin what you have called a period of ‘renewal’ and what others of us may call a period of ‘rectification’, and we cannot leave the renewal or rectification in the hands of those who do not believe in the European Union. The difference is that the rectification must be profound and must be ordered, led by our conviction that the Union is needed and that we must not act hastily. Your problem is that you only have six months in the Presidency to carry out a profound and ordered rectification. In the end, when we act hastily, we always blame others for the Union’s problems, we blame the other Institutions, and that always leads us to confirm our own positions, and that is contrary to the European spirit. An ordered rectification is required. Each Institution must be able to diagnose what is keeping Europeans at a distance from the Union, and plan its work accordingly. The Council must do it, the Commission must do it and Parliament must do it. And each Institution must focus in particular on what is alienating Europeans today. It will not be the approach of one country that will lead the future recovery of confidence amongst Europeans; it will be a few European political projects, a few, but they will be important. The European Union cannot carry on talking about everything and saying nothing. We must be able to identify those political problems associated with Europeans’ real security, economic growth and cohesion problems. I will end by saying that step-by-step progress was the key approach of those exemplary Europeans who established the Union; we must not take a step backwards today, we must raise our sights, we must go beyond the routine, which is the worst fault of the European Union’s bureaucracies.

Mr President, I would like firstly to thank Commissioner Frattini and the Council’s coordinator of the fight against terrorism, Mr Gijs de Vries, for being here this morning. I would also like to thank all the MEPs who have worked and cooperated, sometimes on the basis of discrepancies and sometimes on the basis of agreement, on this report on the prevention of and response to terrorist attacks and I would like in particular to thank my good friends Rosa Díez and Antoine Duquesne for their cooperation and their contributions to this report. In the few minutes available to me I would like to be very concise and in particular to summarise the reasons and objectives that have inspired me to present this report in the European Parliament today. What have I wanted to contribute today in this House by means of this report? Simply the little I have been able to learn, my limited and modest experience of what fighting a terrorist organisation has meant, for more than twenty-five years, in my country, Spain, and in the Basque Country. I therefore believe that the most important thing today is to turn the European Union's traditional approach to combating terrorism, which has usually been by means of an exhaustive list of measures, into what I believe must be a European political project. You may ask me what the difference is between an exhaustive list of measures and a political project. A political project is much more ambitious than a list of measures. A political project is always the result of a priority, of an emphasis and, above all, of an appropriate and correct mindset. And a political project, above all, has the capacity to be summed up and understood simultaneously by a public opinion that appreciates the efforts of a politician to turn that list of measures into a political project. Allow me to point out that the recent results in Europe confirm to us that we need a limited number of political projects, because there cannot be infinite political projects. We must have just a few political projects, which are understood by the European citizens and able to tackle their problems. And I believe that one of them is unquestionably terrorism. Terrorism cannot be fought in a generalised fashion. The security forces cannot take on the correct mindset if we are fighting terrorism in a generalised fashion. We must combat a particular type of terrorism, a particular organisation. It is true that it must always be fought on the basis of the same principles of freedom, of respect for human rights, of the ideas upon which Europe is based, but in each case we must be able to create a particular concrete political project, and we must always be able to specify, determine and measure the organisation being fought; amongst other reasons, as I said before, because that is the only way to stimulate the security forces to put every possible effort into combating a particular organisation. What is a terrorist organisation’s main ally? Its dispersed nature: we never know where it begins and ends; we do not know what social structure sustains it nor which States, on occasions, are behind that group. But it always has social support, and one of the keys to combating the phenomenon of terrorism is to be aware of the range of the organisation and of the social strata supporting it. For this reason – and I regret certain amendments to this effect - I regret that we have not had the courage to call the organisation that the Europeans are faced with, which is a radical, Islamist organisation, or one that claims to defend Islam, that is to say Al Qaeda, by its name. It is essential to call it by its name, because that is the only way to combat an organisation: we must be able to say what we are currently facing in the European Union. The main risk facing the European Parliament is paralysis, inaction, being sure of our principles and values and being in general agreement, but not creating a common European political project to deal with this great issue that is going to affect our present and our future, and treating it as if it were somebody else’s problem: as if it were something that happened to the Americans on 11 September, a few years ago, or specifically to Spain, for particular reasons, on 11 March, but I do not believe that that is what we should do. In conclusion, I would like to remember the victims and say that they must always be at the centre of our debate, the main focus of our attention, I would repeat that, on this issue, we must all have the moral strength together with them fundamentally to tackle this issue which is essential in terms of our future.

Mr President, in this very brief speech, I would like to stress the importance of the exchange of information for combating the kind of terrorism we are discussing. This is why Mr Duquesne’s report is so appropriate, since it places the emphasis on this extremely important issue. We must have the courage to call the organisation we are fighting by its name and there is no question that we are facing a series of fundamentalist groups which do not represent Islam, but which claim to operate in the name of Islam. That is why I believe information to be so important, because it is an emerging phenomenon that we have practically no knowledge of, and in the case of this type of phenomenon, information is essential. We certainly do not know how they act and above all we do not understand their sense of time. They are not like other organisations that have the same sense of time as us. That is why it is so important that we be able to work to understand the social support for these organisations, in the knowledge that they are prepared to die, to sacrifice their lives in these attacks, something that does not happen in the case of other kinds of organisation. That is why it is so important that we are able to place the emphasis on the exchange of information from national police forces and not just with Europol. The European project must have sufficient capacity to promote the exchange of information amongst national police forces, who are the bodies working in particular on this phenomenon. The Council, the Commission and this Parliament must therefore create more fora for exchanging information amongst the police forces working on this sensitive and difficult issue.

Mr President, of the many issues dealt with at the European Council, I would like to focus on two: promoting the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice and the process of economic and social modernisation of Europe, also known as the Lisbon Process. I would like to congratulate the Dutch Presidency on the exhaustive Hague Programme in relation to the area of freedom, but I would like to add a brief comment. We still need to establish emphases, priorities, with regard to promoting this area. Governing means making choices and establishing priorities. Times have changed since Tampere I. The time has come to choose priorities and identify the most urgent problems affecting the co-existence of the Europeans and, above all, those which are going to affect its future. We must have the courage to choose and to accept the risk. Courage is what the future of this area of freedom and justice in the European Union is going to require. The Council says, for example, that the fight against terrorism must be given impetus, but it still does not have sufficient impetus to identify Islamist terrorism as the main problem threatening the co-existence of the Europeans. Madrid, Beslan, the tragedies of the European hostages and last week’s events in the Netherlands confirm this. More Union means more ability to choose and select. So this area must be promoted on the basis of a few, very few, but solid and identifiable European political projects which deal with the real problems facing us, the first of which is Islamist terrorism. The greatest risk to Europe in this field is inaction, paralysis and not knowing what to do. The Hague Programme does not mention the necessary protection for the victims of terrorism, and I regret that the conclusions have not mentioned this Parliament’s request concerning the creation of the European Office for Assistance for Victims or the consolidation over the coming years of a political project, a political programme aimed in this direction. Mr President, having seen the report on the mid-term review of Lisbon, the most important thing is that we are aware that we are seriously behind schedule. The European Parliament must promote this Lisbon Process on the basis of three very simple and fundamental ideas: the first is that this Parliament must encourage governments to show signs of courage and to promote the necessary structural reforms, since more Union requires more Europe and more structural reforms; the second is to accept that employment is undoubtedly the best social policy, since more Union means more emphasis on job creation; and, finally, in order to implement Lisbon, the States need streamlined public finances, since more Union requires more budgetary stability demands and no more relaxation of finances amongst the European States as a whole. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for the work you have done over recent months.

Mr President, nobody questions the importance of Tampere I: it set a direction, it opened up an internal space and, consequently, numerous actions were initiated in all areas. Those of us who promoted and actively participated in Tampere I know that Tampere II has to be radically different. It cannot simply be a multi-annual programme with the same characteristics as the previous one. It must be able to choose, select, specify, emphasise and, above all, prioritise. These are not the only verbs one could use to describe what Tampere II must achieve. We must move on from the general fight against terrorism to a European political project able to deal with the fight against Islamist terrorism; from general plans to combat terrorism, we must move on to explaining what concrete measures our fight against a specific organisation requires. I would like to point out that our colleague Alain Lamassoure has just introduced a European pilot project for combating Islamist terrorism into this Parliament’s budget: I believe that that is the path the European Council must take. The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, replacing the European Union’s President-in-Office, has stated that combating terrorism is our continent’s priority, since the attacks in Madrid, the Philippines and Asia show that this problem affects all of us. But it is not just a question of foreign policy: it must have consequences for internal policy. There can be no European foreign policy unless we first have a shared internal policy within the European Union; there can be no foreign policy in Europe unless we first create an area of freedom capable of dealing with the fight against terrorism.

Madam President, Mr Barroso, this is no ordinary moment in the history of the European institutions; we are in the process of drawing up a Constitution for Europe. A Constitution is more than just another Treaty and the stage leading up to the adoption of a Constitution is not just another stage. How must politicians behave at a time when we are drawing up a Constitution? We must be in a position to partially put aside our ideological differences and our party differences. What are we going to ask of the European citizens when we ask them to support the European Constitution? That they put aside their ideological differences in order to vote for a constitution for everybody. We are going to ask supporters of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, socialists, liberals and conservatives to vote together for the Constitution. And how can we ask them to make this effort and to behave in this way if we are emphasising our ideological differences and our parties’ strategies differ more than ever? Parliament must be the exemplary institution during this formative period. Parliament is the only institution elected by universal suffrage by all the citizens, and the social environment our societies require demands that we start by creating a political environment which is based on the greatest possible degree of cohesion and unity. We therefore want to act in a manner which is consistent with this political environment which the adoption of the European Constitution is going to require, by supporting Mr Barroso unequivocally. Some people believe that a defeat for Mr Barroso will be a victory for the European Parliament. I must tell them that they are wrong: it will be a success for those who do not believe in the European Union. (Applause)

Mr President, I would firstly like to thank and congratulate Mr Bourlanges on his report, not only on its content, but on his ability to accept the many amendments we have presented to him. I thank you for that, Mr Bourlanges. I am going to restrict myself to two comments on what this new stage in the development of the European policing area of freedom and justice may mean. The first is that, in the field of security of the Tampere Summit, I would stress two initiatives which I believe have been very significant in terms of creating this area. Firstly, the European arrest warrant, which was undoubtedly the consequence of the horrendous attacks of 11 September, and secondly, the action plan against terrorism, which was also the consequence of the horrendous attacks in Madrid, initiatives which we owe largely to Mr Vitorino. Today, I believe, is a good day to acknowledge this. An area of freedom and justice, however, cannot be built on the basis of responses or reactions to attacks and we do not want to see the third significant initiative relating to this area being taken following attacks. We must be capable of replacing reaction with initiative and replacing isolated measures, although they may be part of a plan, with a genuine political plan. The second consideration must provide us with a methodology on which to base this second phase in the development of the area. Firstly, diagnosis: the Council must ask the governments what the main security problem facing those countries is and we need to identify the main problem affecting the security of the Europeans. Like Mr Vitorino, I believe that today it is Islamist terrorism and that, in my view, is the main security problem facing the Europeans. Secondly, following this diagnosis, we must understand that a political project is more than an action plan; it is not simply a series of measures, it requires effort by the governments, the Council and the Commission in order to deal with the problem. Terrorism cannot be dealt with in a generalised fashion. We have to decide how we are going to deal with a specific terrorist organisation in a specific way. And, after the diagnosis and after the political project, we will then know exactly how to shape and define a European police and judicial area. But that is the order in which we must do things, not the other way round, as is the case sometimes. I will end by saying that a European area of freedom, security and justice must be twinned with the diagnosis of a problem and must be efficient in order to resolve problems. And if we are not capable of being efficient and if we do not relate the area to the resolution of the problem, there will be no common police and judicial area. (Applause)

Mr President, what happened in Beslan is fundamental proof that Islamist terrorism is now, and will continue to be, the main problem affecting coexistence amongst Europeans. It is not just an emerging problem. We must have no doubt that it will be an increasing problem. The greatest risk facing us Europeans in relation to this phenomenon is that the European citizens may come to the conclusion that our reaction is fundamentally the failure to act, paralysis, doing nothing. That is the greatest risk, the greatest difficulty: not knowing how to confront this terrible risk on the basis of our principles, convictions and values. On the basis of my personal experience, I believe that, in order to tackle the scourge of terrorism, the first thing, the most important thing, is to increase awareness, awareness of the seriousness of the problem. Legislative and operative measures will be important, but the most important thing is to increase awareness. There are two sides to this increasing of awareness: firstly, we must have the courage to treat the fight against terrorism as our very top priority amongst all our problems. We must therefore say it, repeat it and affirm it in all the Union’s documents, in all our public statements: terrorism is the main problem. I would go as far as to say today that the principal gap in the European Union's anti-terrorist policy is not the lack of measures and initiatives, but the fact that we do not acknowledge sufficiently that terrorism is the main problem facing Europeans. Secondly, the second objective in terms of increasing awareness is the conviction that we can defeat this phenomenon. We cannot start to fight terrorism unless we are sure, on the basis of the moral strength of our convictions, that we will be able to beat terrorism. Terrorism is essentially about fear, it generates fear. And the fear of failure we feel when we deal with a problem of this nature is the first thing we must conquer if we are then to conquer the terrorist organisation. Ladies and gentlemen, it takes time to tackle a terrorist phenomenon. There are no shortcuts and no possibility of magic solutions. But each and every one of us must have conviction from the outset. The fight against terrorism has nothing to do with the left or right; it is essentially a moral obligation. I therefore believe we must dedicate more time, more single-issue debates in this Parliament, to tackling terrorism. I believe we must state more frequently that terrorism is the main problem facing Europeans and we must promote a debate amongst governments in order to ascertain in certain circumstances, when terrorist attacks take place close to elections, what instruments are available to those governments in order to defend themselves, whether or not this may include delaying elections, in order to prevent terrorists from achieving their objectives. In summary, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have a moral duty of the highest order. (Applause)

Madam President, Mr Durão Barroso, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Durão Barroso on the content of the communication this afternoon and I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that he is the candidate proposed as President of the European Commission. You have put it quite rightly. This is not just any old moment, these are not normal circumstances, it is not just any old Commission you are going to lead over the coming years and there are at least three reasons for such an unusual situation. The first reason is enlargement – I am not sure we appreciate that this will be the first Commission since enlargement. The second reason is that five years ago, when the mandate of the previous Commission began, the horrendous terrorist attacks of 11 September, and those of 11 March in Madrid, had not yet taken place. And, thirdly, because these events have been accompanied by a drop in turnout at the European elections. Possibly, for these three reasons, in colloquial terms, we should take a break in our journey. But in politics there are no breaks and in the European Union we cannot take any break or stop. But that break must be replaced by reflection more profound than ever and which, at the same time, allows us to aim higher than ever, when it comes to dealing with the future of the European Union. This afternoon, I believe there is a conclusion we all agree on: we have all said we must strengthen the European institutions and have all emphasised in particular that we must strengthen the Commission. We all agree on this. The question is how we can strengthen the Commission further. You have also put it very well: it is not a question of the Commission having lots of powers, but of it being able to lead, guide, organise and establish priorities. I am left with two of the key issues you have pointed out this afternoon: firstly, that the Commission, above all, has to be able to lead, guide and organise the work of the Ministers of the nations making up the European Union; secondly, that there will be no foreign policy for the European Union unless we first have a solid internal policy able to deal with the common problems we Europeans share. The question for tomorrow, therefore, is: how will we strengthen the Commission? By strengthening or castigating the President of the Commission, through our vote? I have no doubt that the strengthening of the Commission demands that the President of the Commission can count on the full support of the whole of this House and, for this reason, when we vote tomorrow on the appointment of this candidate, I would ask that, over and above personal considerations and ideological issues, we think of institutional stability.

Mr President, I read in the applicable financial regulation that the Secretary-General and High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, assisted by the Deputy Secretary-General, shall have full responsibility for administering the appropriations entered in Section II – Council – of the budget and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are properly managed. Where is Javier Solana? Where is the Deputy Secretary-General, since he is not at this debate? This is despite the fact that the only piece of information that we have, namely the report by the internal auditor, says that there is a B account, an off-budget account at the Council. Pursuant to the financial regulation, it is not the Czech Presidency or the French Presidency but Javier Solana who is responsible for the Council, together with his deputy. What is this off-budget account? The auditor says that this section should be eliminated. We would like to know what it has been used for, and why. We would like to know why, of the EUR 650 million administered by Mr Solana, and for which he is responsible, EUR 13 million was transferred from interpretation to travel expenses in 2006, but in 2007 the allocation for travel expenses was not increased. The same thing is happening again, and we do not know what so much travel means, and where these funds are going to end. We are angry, because there is only one exception to the democratic scrutiny exercised by this Parliament over all the accounts funded by taxpayers in the European Union: the accounts kept by the Council. Those are not audited. We, the Members of this Parliament, have not even been able to obtain a single official meeting with the Council to discuss the accounts. They have refused to give us papers. They have refused to give us documents. They understand that we have no jurisdiction to scrutinise the Council; this was all very well when the Council carried out solely administrative duties, but now the Common Foreign and Security Policy represents operational expenditure, and we do not understand why this should be exempt from democratic scrutiny. Here, therefore, I would like to say that the attitude adopted by the Secretary-General, Mr Solana, is unacceptable and that therefore, on this occasion this Parliament is going to propose that the Council’s accounts not be approved, as happened 10 years ago when Mr Elles said that he was refusing to approve the Commission’s accounts, triggering the resignation of the Santer Commission.

 Mr President, I am grateful to Mrs Yade for being present at this debate on a subject that causes citizens so much concern. This Parliament is coming to the end of a term in which we have tried to tell the taxpayer that we check the accounts here and that we do so as well as possible. We admit that mistakes are made and things are not always done correctly but, above all, we have calculated the amount of fraud and we are doing everything we can. That is why we set up OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, ten years ago. It is now in urgent need of an appropriate legal framework. Mrs Yade, if you say that we should wait for the Commission to produce its report and only then begin to negotiate what may be the definitive statute for OLAF, we will be wasting time. The elections are coming and we will then be in another parliamentary term. The message that we want to put out to Europe’s citizens is that everyone here – the Council, the French and Czech Presidencies, this Parliament and the Commission – is committed to putting an end to the kind of fraud that exists in developing countries and even in highly developed countries. Thank you, Mrs Yade, for being present at this debate, and I regret that the Commission is not here too.

 Mr President, pursuant to Article 274 of the EC Treaty, the Council has the same responsibility as the Commission for expenditure. We are the budgetary authority. Mr President, did we invite the Council to this debate? I do not see any representatives. Have they apologised for not attending? Have they given any reason for not being here? I do not understand. Is it because they do not want to hear for the fourteenth time that the Court of Auditors says that things must improve, given that they are the ones spending more than 80% of Europeans’ money? Or is it because they, as the Member States, are happy with what they are spending, whereas here in Parliament we have the cheek to question the errors of an absent guest, because I am assuming that they were invited?  (FR) 
I shall say it in French. We are in France. Where is the French Presidency? Where is Mr Sarkozy? Where is your representation in this debate?  (ES)
 We will have to see whether, in the words of Molière, they arrive ere long. This is unacceptable. All my colleagues on the Committee on Budgetary Control agree with me that this should not happen again. I thought that the excellent French Presidency would also improve this aspect of facing up to the consequences. For it is here where they must face up to the consequences. They cannot spend and then not come here. For it is also the Council, and not just the Member States, that are subject to our scrutiny. However, they are never here because they do not want to keep hearing the same thing. The solution would be to have national statements. I have two points to make. Congratulations, Mr Silva Caldeira. In this latest debate of this parliamentary term, you have produced a very good report. The Court of Auditors, of which you are the President, is partly responsible for things having improved. Please convey our congratulations to all your members, as several of my fellow Members have said. Mr Kallas, this Commission has improved things considerably. Unfortunately, we have not achieved the ultimate goal of a positive Statement of Assurance, but things are going well. I have a small suggestion to make: we must simplify. We must simplify and give responsibility to the Member States and then they must come here to face up to the consequences. Simplification and removal of red tape will be the way to improve how Europeans’ money is spent.

 Firstly, Mr President, it is a shame that the Finnish Foreign Minister, Alexander Stubb, is not here today as he contributed so much in the Committee on Budgetary Control and to this report. I am here to give the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Following on from the final words of Commissioner Kallas, I would stress once again that the role of the Members of the European Parliament is to remain in as close contact as possible with all citizens – with interest representatives and with non-interest representatives – and that this Parliament therefore has to have its own rules. My office is open to anyone wanting to have a coffee with me or invite me for a walk. I cannot demand that people are registered in a special register. I cannot tell someone who is not registered that I cannot receive them in my party, the Unión del Pueblo Navarro
. I cannot say ‘you must be registered’. No, indeed: administration is one thing, but the political function of this Parliament is something else entirely. We would therefore do well to have two ways of ensuring transparency. I was the rapporteur on transparency, that great project which has brought Commissioner Kallas here. Transparency must not prevent our contact with real life, with interest representatives or non-interest representatives. Thank you. I am sure that Commissioner Kallas understands this.

Mr President, welcome to this debate, attended by the Secretary-General and of course welcome to Mr Kallas. I cannot welcome anyone from the Council, as it appears that it does not have anything to do with accounts and taking responsibility for the political debate on discharge. I hope that when the Council has a president, after the Treaty of Lisbon, we will be guaranteed that the Council will also be present at this debate. I would first like to congratulate my colleague Dan Jørgensen on his excellent report, and highlight from what he said how well things are being done in the European Union, and how they are being done better every year. He referred on several occasions to an initiative by Commissioner Kallas and the Commission on transparency. I was rapporteur two months ago for an own-initiative report supporting the transparency policy. Well, the Commission is indeed making progress on transparency policy, as Parliament has also done. I would like to point out that the role of Parliament in giving discharge is a political role, and that we are not and nor should we be accountants. It is a political role, and the question that we have to answer for citizens is: with the money that Parliament has, have we been able to meet the budgetary challenges for the 2006 financial year? Challenges such as Parliament preparing for enlargement, to receive new Member States, expanding the information policy, doing our work better, preparing ourselves for the challenge of Lisbon, in that we are going to have to legislate more and in the best possible way. What is the political verdict on what we have done with these financial commitments? It is a positive one. We have done well. I would like to highlight a few points from this financial year. Firstly, on the initiative of President Hans Pöttering, we have initiated a political dialogue between the Presidency and the procedure for discharge, which until now did not appear to be possible. Now it is possible, and your vice-president was present at the debate, facing up to the questions put to him live and direct by the committee. Also, on the initiative of the President, the Bureau is going to have a regular procedure of working with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, so I thank you. Many aspects of transparency in Parliament have improved, as you can see in the report. We have improved the presentation of the roles of our assistants. What has not been possible this year has been for us to finally create a statute for assistants, which we are asking for. The truth is that as MEPs it has taken us a long time to have our own statute. In short, we will have to ask for patience, but we must emphasise that we have not yet achieved this objective. In 2006, however, the reference year, 99% of papers were submitted in the right way, so I think that this issue is also moving in the right direction. We have outstanding problems, and on these we are more or less trying to do what we can. Citizens do not understand why Parliament should have three locations, they do not understand it, and they are not going to understand it because it is not easy to understand. This is another challenge for when the Council has a president: finding a solution. Parliament has, however, done its duty and reduced the cost of the three locations from EUR 203 million in 2002 to EUR 155 million. We have cut the bill by 24%, which is good. What challenges are we going to tackle, as I mention in this report? As I have just said, giving our assistants a definitive statute, as we have ourselves. There is also the challenge of legislating better. Parliament is going to play a much greater qualitative role and have a much larger workload with the Lisbon Treaty when it comes. Let us hope that the Belgian Government, now that we have a Belgian Government, will treat us a little better in terms of buildings policy than it has up to now, as its treatment has been mediocre. I would like to finish by saying that we have had a prudent year in terms of our budgetary responsibilities, and this is why I am asking you to vote in favour of these accounts for 2006.

Mr President, sometimes we cannot see the wood for the trees. In this discharge procedure we have to say what is going wrong, and sometimes we forget how many things are going well, how many extremely competent staff we have in the Commission and in this House, in Parliament, including the ushers, so many services, the translators, the interpreters , who provide an excellent service. We forget how we are able to stretch the budget that we have in order to fulfil our objectives, how Parliament and the Commission have made more and more progress on the transparency policy. There is still a challenge, a very important challenge for Parliament, which is the communication and information policy. It was one of the objectives that Parliament had for 2006, and I am not happy with how it has developed. We have elections in a year’s time, and we need to know how to get there, which means improving our information procedures and continuing to be transparent, as we are being. Transparency, and I was rapporteur for this report, is compatible with having documents that are not public, as occurs in the Member States, for journalists, in businesses and in families. It is good for our work if there are levels of drafting criteria that have not passed through the sieve of public approval, and must therefore logically be the secret of those of us who are working on the matter. I am entirely satisfied with the access that I have had to all of the information, and I think that the report that I am presenting on Parliament’s accounts is a responsible report. I say that Parliament’s accounts should be discharged, because Parliament, if you will allow me to say so, operates very well, and much better than some national parliaments, in a much more transparent way and with staff who work more hours than may be worked in similar parliaments. This is not to say, therefore, that it is perfect: we need to keep working. We still have a long way to go, but in this political year, we have a positive picture of how we have used the money that our citizens have given us; we have used it well, transparently and coherently.

Mr President, there has actually been an error with the numbers, and what we are going to vote on first, by means of a separate vote, is paragraph 65, except for indent 4, and we will then have a roll-call vote on indent 4. There has been a change of numbers, it is that simple.

 Mr President, our European Parliament has always wished to implement a policy of transparency with regard to our funds, the EU’s funds. Such was the case when, perhaps through mismanagement, problems arose that forced the Commission headed by Mr Santer to resign. Since then it must be said that things have improved considerably; this Parliament has propelled a policy of transparency, and the Commission has supported the Parliament. The result of this interest on the part of the Barroso Commission is the creation of nothing less than a Vice-Presidency to achieve this objective, represented here by Vice-President Siim Kallas, whom I welcome. European citizens must know what we do with the very small amount of money they pay to the EU, what we do with that scant 1%; we must have more control over Community funds through visibility. Visibility is no longer just a notice hung up in a town hall or on a building site financed with regional funds or the Cohesion Fund; we have to go much further, and it must be possible to determine the whereabouts of that small amount of money provided by European taxpayers through Member States. That is the Transparency Initiative, which this Parliament supports wholeheartedly. This own-initiative report we are submitting says two things. The first is that a little more must be done. In the text we have chosen to say that transparency must be manifested by the publication of black lists and information as to which tenderers have been accepted and which have been excluded, and OLAF must have a code to guarantee the presumption of innocence, which has not been the case on many occasions. In other words, within the EU, the European Parliament already has its own code of ethics. We are not officials, we are politicians; we must be transparent too, and we already are. Thus in Amendment 2 to paragraph 22, I request that the list proposed by the Transparency Initiative be removed, in the main not only because this Parliament has already taken decisions on our financial interests, missions and travel, but because we also feel there must be rules for the entire European Union. This Parliament has its own rules, but they will have to improve and perhaps go even further. There is another amendment where I remove the reference to MEPs as holding public posts; we do not hold public posts, we are politicians. This confusion could lead to problems in some national legislation. Through this idea of increasing transparency, which we support, we also wish to draw attention to the fact that Member States share the management of 80% of the funds, and so we again call for Member States to submit National Declarations of Assurance. This is urgent and necessary, and we insist it must be done. We are saying that the initiative presented by Commissioner Kallas must include the recovery of Community funds. This cannot be excluded: when our money is misused, we must know where it is, how it is to be recovered, and when it is to be recovered. We have made many improvements in terms of transparency, Commissioner, but this Parliament will strive to make many more.

 Mr President, Mr Kallas can feel pleased with himself because he realises the transparency initiative is one which is much appreciated and dear to the hearts of the entire House, and because he has now experienced the support that can be found here. Mr Kallas, we wish to go further with regard to transparency, and in the report we outlined some of the areas in which progress ought to be made: recoveries, expert groups or the presumption of innocence. Nevertheless, I urge you: this must remain within the confines of common sense, with no consideration for the populism of certain elements of the gutter press that seems to devote itself to earning money through its populist exaggerations of serious topics in the European Union. I wish to thank Inés Ayala for her suggestion that OLAF should concern itself with these matters too, and Mr Jørgensen, Paulo Casaca, Mr Bösch, who is present, and my colleagues Ingeborg Grässle, Alex Stubb, etc. I would like to say that Alex Stubb also asked me what I would take out, and I must say that, for instance, I would remove the reference to a spouse’s activity. I remember that the greatest problem in the European Union was caused not by a spouse, but something similar: I refer to the case of Edith Cresson. By this I mean that we should not be placing such restrictions on ourselves, and we should do what is logical, not what is illogical. Indeed, even Members of this House also have a right to family life and private life. I also wish to say that we will continue to set an example for many Member States of how the EU is spending its funds better and more efficiently, with low administrative costs and much more effectively than certain Member States. In this preliminary mission on which we all agree, several Member States – those that refuse to give explain how they spend 80% of Community funds and then seem to be all smiles when we refuse to approve the EU accounts – use this to justify giving less money to the common fund, limiting EU activity, abusing our accusations that it is the Member States that do not spend correctly and using this argument to refuse to give this House more than 1%. Thank you, Mr President, and may I also wish Mr Kallas well in securing an objective so warmly supported by Parliament.

Mr President, Hans-Gert Pöttering, I am pleased that you are attending this debate, underlining the importance which the Parliament attaches to the auditing of its accounts, and that Vice-President Kallas and President Weber are also here, but where is the Council? Where is the speaker who can tell us what the Council is doing with all the suggestions and comments that the President of the Court of Auditors, Vice-President Kallas and I myself have been putting to the Council? Thank you, Mr President, for attending this debate. (Applause from certain quarters)
 I would like to begin by thanking the Court of Auditors for its excellent work, especially chapter 2 of its report, which is very well presented. You are getting better at this job all the time and are helping not only the Parliament, but also the man in the street, to realise what it costs to run the European Union. Farmers should be congratulated because now that we are reducing direct payments to them they have managed to improve their management of the money they receive significantly. However, such praise cannot be heaped on structural funds. It is now three years since this Parliament said that the Council, the great absentee, should be involved in order to account for how it spends the greater part of the budget which it controls. One thing is clear: it is now obligatory, under the new Financial Regulation, for Member States to submit their summary national management declarations. It is not an option, it is mandatory. They have to do this before mid-February next year; and as we know – and here we agree with Mr Kallas – the Member States are unwilling to do so: it seems as though they are not required to present accounts. If they have an obligation, they should be the first ones to set an example. You said that only six Member States are accounting for how they recover funds. That is scandalous, it deserves a headline: only six Member States are telling us what they are doing about recovering funds which they have misused. That really is a scandal. To sum up, I would like to tell you that this Parliament will continue its work; may you continue with yours. You and Mr Kallas have our full support in continuing to strive towards the goal of a positive DAS, and we take our share of the blame for all those particularly burdensome procedures; we are to blame there because sometimes we ask for the impossible. We offer our collaboration in order to simplify procedures as far as possible. Thank you, Mr Weber, for your magnificent report.
 José Javier Pomés Ruiz (PPE-DE

I would like to begin with a procedural question. Where is the Council, Madam President? I would insist, where is the Council? We are talking about a budget, 90% of which is spent by the Member States. So where is the Council? Where is the Council, Mr Kallas? My dear friend Herbert Bösch, ladies and gentlemen of the German press who are following our proceedings, Frankfurter Allgemeine
, Die Welt
, where is the Council? Why is it not here when we are talking about how the Council spends 90% of our budget? My dear friends Herbert Bösch and Markus Ferber, German fellow Members, we have a German Presidency. Where is the Council? Why is the Council not showing its face here, listening to all of our views on how the Member States are spending the budget? I hope that in the Committee on Budgetary Control, under the chairmanship of Herbert Bösch, we can take some sort of initiative to point out that it is scandalous – if the press has not already said so – that nobody from the Council is present, to show its face, so that it can respond if necessary to our comments. I cannot put it any more directly. Moving on from that issue, which is a serious one, this debate is gaining weight year by year, and we appreciate, and I applaud, Vice-President Siim Kallas’s communication to the effect that we have now recovered EUR 2.1 billion from the Member States. That is money that they have spent badly and we are recovering it. I would love to know how this EUR 2.1 billion is distributed. We have asked for that information and we are sure that, within the context of the transparency initiative that he is heading and which this Parliament will support, we will find out the details. This is perhaps where the Council is seeing sense. That what is not spent properly should return to the Community’s coffers. I therefore wholeheartedly welcome Siim Kallas’s initiative to be especially tough, honest and firm in the recovery of badly-spent funds.

Mr President, why are we talking about the United Nations? Because the European Union is the main donor of the funds that make it possible for that wonderful invention to operate. I have here with me Nirj Deva, who is a fierce advocate of the necessary role that the United Nations must play in the world. A hundred thousand people are working for the United Nations to maintain peace in the world and practically every single one of them does their work very well, but there have been accusations of, and complaints about, crimes of sexual abuse, child prostitution and paedophilia. There have been accusations in the Republic of Congo, in Kosovo and now in Liberia and in Haiti, the country from which I have just returned. Since 1994, amongst the one hundred thousand personnel deployed as peace-keeping forces, more than three hundred cases of sexual crimes against children, against people with few resources, have been investigated. As a result of the three hundred and nineteen cases investigated, one hundred and seventy-nine soldiers have been found guilty. If we are going to maintain peace and if we need the Member States of the United Nations to send personnel, we must do everything we can to ensure that they are going to maintain peace and not to indulge in sexual tourism paid for essentially with Europeans’ money. This Resolution is therefore intended to praise the role of the United Nations, but also to state that we need the Member States responsible for peace-keeping forces and soldiers to behave in a civil manner that respects human rights. We must therefore prevent any more rapes of women and children, we must prevent paedophilia and we must stop European money being used, via the United Nations, for the purposes of committing sexual crimes.

Madam President, as the Court of Auditors' report says, we have made progress in many areas. I would like to thank it for its report. But there is one area in which we have not made any progress: in pointing to Member States individually. We are a group of twenty-five and we cannot just give one mark for the whole of the class The 300 pages of its report contain references to Greece, but you have never said which Member States are mainly responsible for our not achieving the target or — if you do not just want to be hatchet men — which Member States are doing well or are greatly improving. Other institutions do it: the European Central Bank points to individual Member States by name. You are not an assembly of diplomats defending national interests. In your press communiqués, you must point out, amongst other things, which States are doing things well and which are not. The Finnish Presidency is not even represented here, but on the basis of the report by the House of Lords, a report for which we have great respect, I am going to ask, on behalf of the group that I coordinate, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for an initiative report to look into the Court of Auditors' methodology. I well remember how one of its members, the Belgian member, Mr Pinxten, took his post without giving up any of his economic or political responsibilities. In the end, when he was threatened with being brought before the courts, he had to leave by the back door. That shameful episode was not unfortunately the finest hour of the Court of which you are the worthy President. I would like to say one thing to Vice-President Kallas. In your speech to the Committee on Budgetary Control on the 23rd, you said that 2 100 million had been recovered. You criticised the auditor harshly — I do not know whether that is the best you could do — but I would like you to specify, if possible, which policies, programmes and Member States that 2 100 million recovered relates to.

Madam President, I too regret that the Council is not here. The Council’s absence from these debates has become far too frequent and I believe it would be good to remind it that it should be here and that it should take good note of that. It was not here for the presentation of the Court of Auditors report this morning either. Although Mr Weber, President of the Court of Auditors, has met with Ecofin, the political debate amongst those of us representing the citizens takes place in this Chamber. I therefore disapprove of the Finnish Presidency's absence. This morning we read the report of the House of Lords, which gave us a real pasting: it says that we do things badly, that we do not control our spending. Furthermore, we have once again been presented with the report by the Court of Auditors, a report that has always been negative, ever since I joined this Parliament in 1994. For the last twelve years it has said that the Commission and the Council is making an effort, but it has not given its approval. As Françoise Grossetête has said, the Commission’s programme is a political programme and I therefore believe that it is right for the Commission to aim high, but it is doing little in terms of controlling spending. I would like to say to the Commission, which is here today — I regret that the Vice-Chairman of our Committee on Budgetary Control is not here and I thank Mr Almunia for listening — that unless we spend properly, the Council will continue to reduce the budget and we will end up without any Community policies. If your work programme says nothing about controlling the Europeans’ money, what will happen in the end? We will not even reach the 1% threshold. Next year we will have 0.9% of the budget and we will end up with no Community policies in Europe. Get your act together please. State that we want to spend well, better than the Member States, that we want to put the Member States in a position in which that can say that they agree with the way spending is carried out. The citizens must be aware that, if money is spent badly, it is not just the Commission’s fault, but also the fault of the Member States, of the agents. Let us get our act together, let us do something, not just for transparency, but for good spending.

Mr President, I must begin by protesting at the nocturnal hour at which we are holding this debate and by thanking our Secretary-General, Julian Priestley, for being here. But it is very important that we reassure the citizens that money is properly spent. Why is this debate being held at night? Does somebody want to protect the City of Strasbourg? Do not give me the answer now; I would simply ask that, when we hold this debate again in six months time, if we do in fact delay the discharge of the budget, the debate should be at prime time, before the newspapers have gone to print, as they have on this occasion. This debate on such an important issue is being eclipsed by the problem we are facing in relation to the City of Strasbourg, which benefits greatly from having the European Parliament there twelve weeks per year. Paris protects it. That is why it has transferred the École Nationale d’Administration
 from Paris to Strasbourg. Why? It wants to revitalise Strasbourg; we understand its interest. The City of Strasbourg, as Mr Stubb has said, has published a note. If the note is intended to explain the difference between the money paid by Parliament and what the owners of the building receive, we must ask them for 'our money back', to use Margaret Thatcher’s terms.
 Fortunately, we know who has the over-paid money and where it is, and fortunately they are in a position of solvency. If the investigation that will have to look into this incomprehensible imbalance concludes that the City of Strasbourg must return the money, I am sure that it will do so and that the French authorities will do so. This debate is very important. I remember when Mrs Cresson, former Socialist Prime Minister of France, here in this Parliament, refused to accept that she had spent some of the money for which she was responsible badly. In the end, the courts obliged Mrs Cresson to take responsibility, and at that point the whole of the Commission had to take collective responsibility. I hope that things do not go so far this time. I am sure that the City of Strasbourg will do what it must do to return the money, if its only arguments are really those expressed in this feeble press release that it has sent us.

Mr President, I am addressing the twenty practically heroic Members who are here during this night sitting. It is shameful that we have to discuss such important issues at night. Our fellow Members decided that there was no need for Friday sittings, and here we are, at an inappropriate time, which is not worthy of the quality and dignity of our parliamentary work. I will say secondly that we must congratulate Mrs Gräßle on her good work and say that this Parliament is obliged to ensure that the money that the citizens give us is not wasted on administrative costs and that it arrives on time and effectively, and that is the intention of Mrs Gräßle’s report. There are two different philosophies here, and I am delighted that the majority of speakers share this new philosophy — which is different to the one in place when I came to this Parliament four terms in office ago — the philosophy of believing that we must get the best from the people who work on the administration of the budget and that we must establish responsibilities. The political position of imposing bureaucracy on spending is born of distrust in our civil servants, of we politicians not wanting to run any kind of risk. The idea is to get rid of civil servants who make mistakes, and we therefore tell them that, each time they have to buy a pencil, they must follow a long procedure in order to assure us that the pencil has been purchased properly. We do not permit the tiniest error, and there have been cases of our getting rid of civil servants who have done things right many times, but who have made a mistake just once. The philosophy of making the spending procedure less complicated is therefore going to allow Community money, which the Council rations more and more — it is only going to give us 1%, rather than 1.2% — to arrive more efficiently and on time, because there are plenty of examples of Community money reaching the taxpayer, the European citizen, late and inefficiently as a result of our Rules of Procedure and our lack of responsibility as politicians. Thank you very much for this excellent report, Mrs Gräßle.

Mr President, we expected more from you in fact, Mr Winkler. We expected more from the Austrian Presidency in this regard. This is not the first time that this Parliament has seen the Council fall short with regard to what we ask. Now we Europeans have a serious problem: in the financial perspective, this Parliament wanted us to spend 1.14%, but the President-in-Office, Mr Blair, lowered this to 1.04%. From this it would appear that Community policies, which are so effective and which have done so much to move Europe forward, are being badly managed by the European Union and that, therefore, the best thing we can do is reduce the budget, because things are not being handled properly. In that case, what we should do is see to it that there are no European policies, but national policies: let us renationalise the common agricultural policy, let us spend in the Member States. Behind this lies the fact that for 10 years the Court of Auditors has said that it cannot approve the European accounts. But what European accounts, if 80% of the Community budget is managed and spent in the Member States; if just a fifth is managed in Brussels. What is happening? Some national authorities, which want to pay less and want Community policies to have less fuel, now that we are in a Europe of 25 and are about to be a Europe of 27, are telling us, ‘you are spending badly’. What is the Committee on Budgetary Control asking for? We are asking to be told where money is spent badly; if a Member State is spending badly, we want it to be said that that State is spending badly, that it is not Brussels. We want to be told whether the problems have arisen here in Brussels or there in the Member State. And to this end, it would be helpful for us if the Member States confirmed the way in which Community money is spent. I believe that Community money is spent better and more effectively in Brussels than in the average Member State. Nevertheless, as a result of the system we have, Brussels is blamed for bad management, rather than the Member States. I know that the Council has to defend the good name of the Member States. We would ask for co-responsibility, an approval, by whichever authority, whether it be the Finance Minister or the appropriate Court, which confirms that the accounts are managed in each Member State in the way that the European citizens want, so that Vice-President Kallas or Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control are not always to blame; that the blame be shared out and the parties responsible exposed. I would therefore ask you to confirm how each Member State spends the European citizens’ money.

Mr President, this is the eleventh time that we have been given a non-positive Statement of Assurance. I no longer know whether I should say that this is scandalous; it has become customary. Efforts have clearly been made all over the place, but, at the end of the day, this is an unachievable goal following the 11 examinations of the accounts by our Court of Auditors. Things are improving, but not to a sufficient extent. What is the political consequence of this non-positive Statement of Assurance? Well, for our House, for our officials who have to take decisions, it is highly demoralising. It seems a pointless effort to try to comply with the rules, because we never achieve a positive Statement of Assurance. There is a lack of will to take responsibilities and all of the officials are tempted not to spend, in case there is any doubt and they have any problems. It is therefore demoralising on the inside. And on the outside? A great loss of credibility. What are the European citizens going to think if our Court of Auditors, for the eleventh time, says that the accounts are not managed here properly! A scandal. More of the same. Very bad. Even when there is a change of Parliament, a change of Commission, a change of make-up of the Council, things carry on in the same way. Perhaps we should cast our minds back to the Santer Commission, which had to resign as a result of this kind of problem: it does not matter, things remain just as bad. And the Member States? Where is the British Presidency? The Council spends 80%. Where is the British Presidency? It is not here: this really is scandalous, because the Council spends 4 out of every 5 euros but is not even attending this presentation of the accounts. This really is scandalous. The Member States are happy. While their national courts approve their accounts, it is not their problem whether the Union, the money of all the Europeans, is managed properly or not. There may even be some Member States that actually feel quite happy and say to themselves, ‘my money is getting to the farmers, although I am not conforming precisely to the requirements that the Court of Auditors is demanding of me’. They are pleased with themselves. They are not even here. Mr President of the Court of Auditors, as you know, at the last discharge, this European Parliament called for national statements of conformity on the part of Finance Ministries. The objective was to help the Court to publish a positive Statement of Assurance. The ECOFIN of 8 November, as Commissioner Kallas has said, has rejected such national statements. I would like to ask you, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, about what you think of the usefulness of these statements to your work, in terms of your relations with the national authorities, and about the future without such statements. Finally, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, it is of no use to us for you to say that the average across a class of 25 Member States is a fail. Tell us – and this well help you – which are the three best Member States and which are the three worst.

Mr President, this resolution is the result of the commitment made by certain Members of the European Parliament, including Mr Portas, Mr Romeva and Mrs Scheele, in the refugee camps in Tindouf, where we spent four days together experiencing the harshness of living in the middle of the desert. We spent a few days there witnessing the suffering of the Sahrawi people, because they have no political, peaceful or ordered solution to their situation. Like them, we lived without water or electricity. In addition to these harsh conditions in Tindouf  because these 150 000 human beings live in the middle of the desert without any comforts  they are faced, however, with a situation in which our humanitarian assistance is being reduced. The resolution we are proposing here talks strictly about humanitarian assistance, because we witnessed directly the humanitarian difficulties faced by the Sahrawi people as a result of a lack of assistance. The assistance they were receiving is being reduced. I do not know whether any particular Member State of the European Union is responsible for this. France’s position on this conflict is very clear... I do not want to talk about that, however, because what we are saying here is that it is important for the European Union to continue to provide the assistance it has been providing for these 150 000 Sahrawis who are trying to find a solution. Political problems are one thing, and we will have to seek solutions in this regard, and other resolutions will deal with them. We cannot, however, ignore the fact that, just a few kilometres from the European Union, we have 150 000 Sahrawis who are suffering because we are not sufficiently generous and because, by no longer sending flour or by reducing the quotas of food that we were sending, we are contributing to the deterioration of the living conditions in the refugee camps, which are quite difficult enough in themselves. The European Union also has a responsibility as the main donor of aid from the United Nations. We will have to make our voice heard there as well.

Mr President, I would like to greet Terry Wynn and congratulate him on the excellent work he has done on his report. He has demonstrated his experience and he has used it to ensure that our Committee could work much better this time than in previous years. I agree with him that it is scandalous to hear once again from the Court of Auditors that the accounts of our institution, of the European Union, are not reliable. This is a procedural problem and all of us here agree that the system must be changed so that we may finally see the Holy Grail; a positive discharge of our accounts. There is a fundamental problem: the immense number of controls that make spending inefficient. As Alexander Stubb, who has had control responsibilities in Finland, as I have in Spain, has said, there are greater controls in the European Union than there are in the Member States or in other institutions. And inevitably ever greater controls only mean that spending is less efficient, that opportunities are missed, that officials do not want to take any responsibility and efficiency is reduced. We shall have to see how much control we want. The public interest does not necessarily benefit because cars travel at 20 km per hour in order to prevent accidents. We shall therefore have to see how we can promote initiative and put more thought into efficiency than into controls. With regard to the report on the accounts of the European Parliament, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and I would like to say that we Members of the European Parliament effectively have hardly any say over our Statute. We cannot decide where we want to meet nor where we do not want to meet. We are hostages to the decisions of the Council, and it is now time for it to take them. But there is no question that, until it does so, it is better not to touch anything and to leave things as they are. We need a Statute providing for the same fiscal treatment for everybody, and we must not forget that this argument is a substantial element of our Statute and is the way forward. Thank you very much for the two extra seconds you have allowed me, Mr President.

Mr President, for those of us who work to ensure that the Union’s economic resources are well spent, this is a good day: all spending is going to be subject to greater democratic control by Parliament and the Council, and efficiency in spending is going to increase, because governability is being increased: we are replacing vetoes with democracy. That means we are going to be able to spend better; and if the resources the citizens contribute are better spent, we will have more authority to ask for more resources in order to implement the policies the citizens are demanding of the European Union. It is, therefore, a great day, a day for being happy to say ‘yes’, at a time when, through this Constitution, we are bringing the European project to fruition after fifty years. This Constitution brings much progress with it; nevertheless, as our Group President, Mr Poettering, quite rightly said, it is lacking certain things. We have been timid in terms of acknowledging our Christian roots, we have been timid in recognising the obvious. We have just celebrated Christmas; this Parliament will stop at Easter; here in Strasbourg the most important building is not a building like this one, but a medieval building, a cathedral. Perhaps we have been victim to a degree of intolerant secularism, but Christmas, Easter and the Strasbourg Cathedral will still be there and there are many aspects we have been able to improve. We must, therefore, say ‘yes’, because we believe in Europe and we are aware that this European project is going to resolve the daily problems of the citizens. We are going to do so in the best way: by spending better, controlling our spending better and having more democratic and effective policies. Our group and I personally say yes to the Constitution.

We must defend the values of freedom and democracy through the legitimate use of words and the responsible adoption of legislation. The fact that the People’s Republic of China is a big market should not lead us to forget that its political regime has inherited what remains a distinctly Communist system of values, which is a very long way from meeting acceptable standards. The people of Taiwan are still suffering the political oppression and economic isolation imposed on them by the People’s Republic of China, which has recently threatened Taiwan once again with military action. The conditions are not in place for lifting the embargo on the trade in arms. If under current circumstances it is hardly possible to restrict the arms race of the People’s Republic of China, then what will happen if the embargo is lifted? Furthermore, it would be seen as an approval of the current status of confrontation, rather than an insistence on the necessary political dialogue between the People’s Republic and Taiwan. Let us promote political action rather than military action.

Madam President, I am going to comment only on the regulation on cross-border payments and the report drawn up by Mrs Starkevičiūtė. The regulation, as she has explained very well, responds to the needs that have been perceived as a result of the introduction of the euro, and lays down a relatively clear principle: charges must be the same for domestic payments as for cross-border payments. This is a common-sense rule in an internal market, but one that was far from being adhered to prior to this regulation. The regulation has thus become a launch-pad for the Single Euro Payments Area, to which the rapporteur also referred, and I therefore have some additional observations. With time, this regulation has become outdated and it has been necessary to revise it in order to adapt it to the changes on the financial markets and also to the directive on payment services. The Commission set itself three goals in this revision: firstly, to include cross-border direct debits within the regulation’s scope; secondly, to establish procedures for the out-of-court handling of problems that might arise from the application of the regulation; and, thirdly, to ease the balance-of-payments statistical reporting obligations. The European Parliament has, on the whole, agreed with this approach, but it has made three significant changes: a clarification to the legal definitions laid down by the regulation, a warning or reminder to the Member States that they should comply with the regulation more effectively than they have done in the past and, thirdly, a call for significant cooperation between the Member States. My concern was the issue of balance-of-payments statistical obligations, which has been resolved by agreement between the separate institutions. I can therefore say that I am fully satisfied with the result achieved.

Mr President, President of the Commission, I will begin by expressing my concern that the Summit on Employment, to be held in May, has been replaced by a troika meeting, however open this may be. I believe that this decision takes us back to 1996, when employment policies were considered to be policies solely for the Member States. Secondly, with regard to monetary policy, I, along with the whole of my group, am an advocate of radical independence for the Central Bank, but independence does not equate to immunity from criticism. I would like to say at this point that I would have liked the European Central Bank to have been more daring in reducing interest rates, given their impact on European exports, and for it to have been more generous in setting the deadlines for the repayment of the loans granted: the Federal Reserve makes three-year loans; the Central Bank’s loans, however, are for only six months. Once again, in relation to monetary policy, I would like to make a comment: I hope that the rescue plans for financial entities and the possible plans to purchase toxic or damaged assets do not translate into competitive advantages for the banks that receive aid as compared with those that have conducted themselves more prudently and do not need aid. With regard to fiscal stimuli, during the course of the morning we have had a considerable debate. Is it enough? Is it too little? Is the United States doing more than us? Whatever the conclusion of this debate, what is certain is that we are seeing the largest fiscal stimuli that our generation has experienced since 1929. This compels us to coordinate action taken on either side of the Atlantic, and this coordination must be much closer on two issues: completing the Doha Round, to send a signal against protectionism to the whole world and, secondly, a joint examination of world imbalances, which are at the root of this crisis. With regard to the stability pact, I note certain contradictions in the Commission’s position. Today’s debts are tomorrow’s taxes and the Commission ought to ensure that national measures are linked to the Lisbon Strategy and do not jeopardise the sustainability of finances. In order to do this, it needs to monitor with the utmost attention the plans to regain the correct position of those countries – including my own, since I am Spanish – that have strayed into an excessive deficit situation. Mr President, I would like to thank you for your generosity with the time, which I have certainly noticed.
 José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs
. − (ES) 
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the work he has done in order to present today to the House a complete, rigorous and extraordinarily timely report. The Presidency and the Commissioner have referred to the next appointments we have, starting with the London meeting, and followed by Prague, when the European Union and the United States will begin a new relationship, following the election of President Obama. I would like to focus on the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has produced a good piece of work, unanimously adopted, and which is directed towards the following aims. The first aim is to recover from the crisis. Either we recover together, or we will not recover. At the moment we are seeing the largest fiscal packages that our generation has known since the crisis of 1929. They will have a greater impact and a lower cost to the taxpayer if we are able to coordinate our efforts. The second aim is to reform the institutional financial architecture – which has shown itself to be unsuccessful in the current crisis – and to reinstate transparency for products, entities and markets. Either we do this together, or we will not be able to do it. As the Commissioner reminded us, we make up the largest economic bloc in the world and we share – as the rapporteur said – values that will allow this rapprochement. The third aim is the integration of financial markets in order to withstand competition from the emerging markets. In order to do this, it is necessary to bring closer the regulatory markets that make it possible to apply in practice the principle of mutual recognition and better supervision by the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic. The Commissioner referred to the fourth aim, and put it better than I can: we must jointly resist the temptation of protectionism and it would be a good idea to adopt a common position in the Doha Round. Finally, Commissioner, but no less importantly, together we must resolve the global imbalances which have been, in large part, at the root of this crisis. We must create a new international monetary system and it would be a shame if, through not coming to an understanding with our main ally, our voice were to be lost in the global debate.
 José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE-DE

 Mr President, we all agree that the current crisis is much more severe and much deeper than had been forecast. These are extraordinary times that require exceptional measures, and the French Presidency has been equal to the task. It is now up to us – essentially Parliament and the Commission – to ensure that all these special assistance measures do not cause irreversible collateral damage to the architecture of Europe. The first area at risk is competition policy. We are in wartime. Rules of war prevail, but even in wartime the Geneva Convention applies, and it does not, of course, allow banks that have been recapitalised by the state to use this aid to buy up other banks. The Minister knows what I am referring to. The second area is the Stability and Growth Pact, which I consider a keystone of Europe’s architecture. I applaud the taxation measures that are being taken, but I do not applaud the idea of regarding the public purse as a kind of piggy bank that we can smash with our eyes shut, for the money to fall where it will. This is no Marshall Plan paid for by Uncle Sam. It is an economic recovery plan that will have to be paid for by tomorrow’s taxpayers. Let us not forget, therefore, that today’s debts are tomorrow’s taxes. The winner here will not be the one who spends most, but the one who spends most sensibly. The only criterion for deciding whether we are spending well or better is whether it helps us recover from the economic crisis and, essentially, create jobs. I cannot therefore share Mr Rasmussen’s idea that the cleverest pupils in the class are those who have rushed to spend most. Lastly, there is the matter of financial stability, to which Mr Sarkozy referred. I agree that reforms are needed, the regulatory framework must be revised and we need to make an enormous effort to achieve greater cooperation among European regulators, so long as we do not have a single European economic regulator.
 José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE-DE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, I am not going to say much about the exceptional, historic nature of the current crisis. All my fellow Members have mentioned this, and Mr Rasmussen has expressed it very well. I just want to add three things here: this is the worst liquidity crisis that I have ever known, and I am getting on in years; there are no navigation charts or roadmaps for this crisis; and, thirdly, we are well aware that the financial crisis is ongoing and the markets have run dry. The first thing we have to do, therefore, is to normalise the financial markets, and in this respect I am going to talk about the European Central Bank. In this House there is a kind of reverential respect for the European Central Bank. I am a layman in many areas, including this one, but I must say that the ECB has to bring down interest rates quickly and as a matter of urgency. The transfer mechanisms do not work well, as shown in October, when the official interest rate cut was not passed on enough into real interest rates. Secondly, liquidity has to be provided over a longer term than is currently the case. I am aware that for this to happen the framework of guarantees has to be changed, but it has to be done. Financial institutions lend money over the long term and they need reliable financing over the long term as well. The national banks are helping with the Central Bank’s policy to supply liquidity, and this may result in national aids that distort competition. We therefore have to keep a careful watch on this area. My third and last point is that right now budgetary policy has been shown to be playing the central, leading role far more than monetary policy is. Budgetary policy causes external effects, and that means that close coordination is vital. I agree wholeheartedly with what the Commissioner has said. To continue, I also agree that it is important to spend, but most of all it is important to spend wisely on clear objectives that enhance the competitiveness of Europe’s economy. That is the only way in which we will be able to balance our budget again in the medium term. I agree that the Stability and Growth Pact is still in force, and the first thing that the Commissioner should do is tell us what he understands by ‘departing from the reference value’. Does this mean by a few hundredths, a few tenths or a few points? Believe me, Commissioner; I shall keep a careful watch on the work you have to do for the Stability and Growth Pact to remain in force. If you achieve this, may God reward you, and if not, may He hold you to account.

 Madam President, I must start by regretting that the Commissioner responsible is not here with us, although I am not really surprised, because there is plenty of noise and not much substance on this subject: great rhetorical statements about combating VAT fraud and very few measures with which to do so. The communications that the Commissioner has presented to us, the last of which was on 1 December this year, make quite a fuss about the damage that tax evasion causes. It affects sufficiency, it affects equity and it causes market distortions with really major amounts of money. VAT fraud accounts for between EUR 60 billion and EUR 100 billion every year. How can fraud be stopped? The diagnosis given in these communications is also generally correct, rhetorical and grandiloquent. They say that the national authorities have the responsibility to tackle fraud, but that operations where the supplier and the customer do not reside in the same country require cooperation between Member States. They also point out that the Court of Auditors, in its Special Report No 8, states that such cooperation has been clearly unsatisfactory and that action therefore needs to be taken. The problem comes when the Commissioner starts telling us what kinds of action need to be taken. He quite reasonably says that there are two strategies: one, which he calls ambitious, comprises a major reform of value-added tax, involving either a reverse-charge system or a tax withholding system with a clearing house, while the other is what the Commissioner calls ‘conventional measures’. We gathered from his appearance here on 24 June that he was not thinking of embarking on an ambitious reform under any circumstances and that he would confine himself to the ‘conventional measures’. Subsequently, however, when he described the conventional measures, he put forward four that in principle are not bad. He talked about cutting compulsory declaration deadlines, enhancing cooperation among tax authorities, establishing shared liability when the purchaser of the goods does not declare who sold them, and improving the information on VAT taxpayers. He then concluded by saying that not even these four measures were among the concrete measures he was thinking of adopting. Today he comes up with two proposed amendments to the directive and regulation. He says that the aim of the first is to reduce the period for lodging the statements that VAT taxpayers have to submit from three months to one month, and the aim of the second is to reduce the period for transmitting the information to the Member State that has to charge the tax from three months to one month. Full stop. That is all the proposal lays down. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has tried to spice up this really insipid story a little, and we have put forward the following amendments. We have approved an amendment favouring small and medium-sized enterprises, the purpose of which is to reconcile fighting tax evasion with simplification of the administrative burden on small enterprises, to which this Parliament and the EU as a whole have a commitment. We therefore say that the Commission must shortly, within two years, present us with a report describing how these measures have performed, how they have affected the administrative costs of businesses and to what extent they have been useful in combating tax evasion. We also point out that the Commission should get rather more involved than it has been when making legislation. It should play a more leading role. We also call on it to centralise the data that the Member States involved transfer, to draw up a handbook of best practice so that the tax authorities can perform better, to develop indicators to show which areas are risky and which are not, and to tell us who is complying and who is not. Lastly, to make it easier to pursue fraudsters, we are setting up a register of individuals who cannot evade tax by setting up companies. I regret the fact that the Commissioner cannot respond to the amendments that we have drawn up.
 José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil,  
rapporteur.

 Believe me, Commissioner Michel, I appreciate your kindness in being here with us and dealing with topics that actually are tough for anyone. The Commission asked us to be quick and we have responded swiftly. The Committee on Legal Affairs duly issued its opinion in good time and, in a rare show of unanimity, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs approved the report that we are debating today. Commissioner, you have read out to us the proposals that the Council adopted on 1 December, from the notes that were prepared for you in the Committee on Fiscal Affairs. Those proposals, however, are not precisely the ones that we are debating here. What we are debating is something else. I am not surprised that they have told us what they are thinking of doing, because what they have actually done is very little, as I said before. The speed with which Parliament has acted on this really important topic, as my fellow Members have pointed out, has not been matched by enthusiasm in either the Commission or the Council. A very important committee chairman once said that he expected ‘de l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace
’ from the Commission – boldness, more boldness and forever boldness. The Commission holds a monopoly on legislative initiative, and this Parliament has wanted it to be so, but holding this monopoly means that these initiatives have to be put on show and proposed boldly and fearlessly, without holding back for fear that the Council may not approve them. Initiatives need to be launched, pushed forward and fought for, and the Council will have to answer to the Commission and to this Parliament if the proposals are not successful. This has not been the case. What I described in my earlier speech was a story of declining ambition, from the most absolute proposals to conventional measures, to a package of measures from which only two, the most modest of them, are selected. I am grateful to Mr Michel and ask him to pass on to the Commissioner responsible my thanks for having accepted a couple of amendments, but I feel really frustrated by what we have debated here.

 Madam President, I am not really going to talk about the diagnosis of the financial crisis. We all agree that this started as a crisis of liquidity which then became a crisis of solvency and which has ended up as a crisis of confidence, resulting in a lack of credit which has now damaged the real economy. The response, contrary to what has been said here, has not been a united European response. In the best-case scenario, it has been a coordinated response. You may say that, in the current situation, nothing more can be done. However, I believe that more can definitely be done. As regards the financial rescues and also liquidity and solvency, it is shocking that three institutions are assisting the markets and giving loans all at the same time: namely the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Commission itself. All three are competing with each other, to everyone’s detriment. As regards fighting the crisis in the real economy, the Washington Summit announced budgetary remedies but did not say what these would be. Some countries will opt to reduce taxes, whereas others will opt for a public spending programme in the purest Keynesian style. We would do well to find out whether, if all these actions are not coordinated, those which work will benefit those which do not. We would also do well to lay down rules on the Stability and Growth Pact. In international terms, it is true that my country of Spain and also the Czech Republic and the Netherlands were present in Washington but did not attend the preparatory meetings, and no one can guarantee that they will do so in the future. I should like the Council and the Commission to tell me how they plan to reform the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund and what they plan to do so that all the countries that should be are represented in the Financial Stability Fund. I will end with a warning. Parliament is being asked to cooperate with the Commission’s plan: we always have done. If the Commission had heeded the warnings that we have been giving since 1999 in repeated reports ignored by the Commission and Mr McCreevy in particular, things would now be very different.
 José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE-DE

 Mr President, I am going to indicate the points on which I agree and disagree with the Presidency and also say what was lacking, in my opinion, from the Presidency’s speech. I agree that the origin of the crisis is not limited to the subprime crisis in the United States. I agree with the principle of what Alan Greenspan is now calling the stage of ‘irrational exuberance’. I agree that the markets have failed because regulation has failed and that governments have had to come to the rescue. I agree that this is a global crisis and I therefore agree with the need for a Bretton Woods that some are calling Mark II and others are calling Mark III. Certainly, President Sarkozy’s reference to the current system reminds me very much of what General de Gaulle did before the first Bretton Woods failed, before the ‘rendition’ of Fort Knox when President Nixon decided to unpeg the dollar from gold. For this reason, we need to establish a European diplomacy, a diplomacy of the euro, where Europe speaks with one voice and has to ‘put its house in order’. However, ‘putting its house in order’ means continuing to develop the financial markets – in this case the retail markets so that they reach the appropriate size – and reflect on the regulatory framework. As for the European Central Bank, I agree that it has done well. It has acted quickly, but also erratically. It has changed the rules on maturities and guarantees three times, whereas the banks need certainty in their financing. Secondly, monetary policy – the lender of last resort – is still centralised. However, banking supervision is still decentralised. Mr President, has the time not come to decide whether we want to develop Article 105 of the Treaty, which gives greater supervisory powers to the European Central Bank? I totally agree on the issue of economic governance. While we are engaged in this ideological dance, we should remember that Marx said that, when economic structures change, the political superstructures must also change. We did Maastricht but we have not sorted out the institutional architecture. Before Lisbon, we must determine which formulas will allow us to advance on this issue. Thirdly, and very importantly, I have one very specific request. The financial economy must be set against the real economy. Do not bid farewell to the presidency, Mr President, without first entrusting the Commission with the specific task of establishing a Lisbon+ agenda which must come into force on 1 January 2011 and which must involve a revision of the financial frameworks. I have a final quotation. On this ideological theme, a Spanish philosopher – Unamuno – once said that he was anticlerical in defence of the Church. I am against total deregulation of the market. I believe that, in this regard, the Presidency and I are in agreement.
 José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil  (PPE-DE

 – (ES)
 Mr President, I will try to be very clear, given the wide variety of opinions expressed from my bench. Firstly, the current crisis is not a biblical curse or a punishment from the gods. The markets have failed and these failures have prompted interventions which would have delighted Keynes himself. If the markets have failed, then we must correct what has failed in the markets; in other words, we must do something. This something involves various things. Firstly, we must administer a shock treatment to bring the patient out of his current coma. I would remind the Commission and the Council that, while the liquidity problems can be solved by the European Central Bank, the solvency problems are something which directly affects you: the Council, the Commission and the Member States. Secondly, to stop this happening again, we need to know what has failed in the markets and what principles we should re-establish. There has been a failure in the management of risk, in governance and, finally, in ethics. This means that we must re-establish some basic principles: transparency in products, in companies and in markets; responsibility of managers; confidence between the financial economy and the real economy, and the central role of politics. I agree with the Council that the times of total deregulation are over. Neither the markets nor industry can self-regulate. The final prescription – which is needed to vaccinate the patient and ensure that this does not happen again or in any other way – is that we must continue with market integration. We have to achieve a sufficiently critical dimension, as they have done in the United States. We have to establish a democracy of the euro so that our currency can have some influence in the world in a crisis that is global. Finally, we have to review the regulatory framework and the supervisory framework which are what have failed. I therefore do not agree with soft legislation, with codes of conduct or with self-regulation. It is up to us all to offer a response to our people who are, after all, the ones who will ultimately pay the price.

 Mr President, Mr Trichet, Mr Juncker, the President of the European Central Bank and the President of the Eurogroup are in agreement that, for ten years, there has been consistent agreement about the relative roles of the various policies. The Central Bank and monetary policy are responsible for ensuring price stability, public accounts need to be balanced in the medium term and the other policies need to create economic growth and growth in employment. When things go wrong, we begin to question this model. We start to offload our own responsibilities onto the shoulders of the European institutions. Some people lay the blame at Mr Trichet’s door, others blame Mr Juncker. If things go from bad to worse, it will be Mr Pöttering who ends up being blamed. At this time, therefore, I think it is important – and Mr Trichet is a good navigator – to keep a steady course and to maintain the model which has enabled us to come this far. I would like to add a few words in terms of prices. It is true, as Mr Juncker says, that we are all responsible in this matter and that governments need to take action; it is a matter which will need to be examined when we tackle market flexibility, when we work out the post-Lisbon strategy. However, there is one matter where the Central Bank needs to take the lead. People say – I do not have the figures – that to a certain extent price increases are due to financial speculation; the transfer of money from the sub-prime and variable interest rate markets to the futures market is partly responsible for this situation, and we will all need to do something about this. In terms of institutional architecture, I would agree with the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, that now is probably not a good time for publication of the full minutes. However, I think that it would be good to publish a summary of the minutes and, even more importantly, I think that the Central Bank should tell us the relative weight given to the two pillars on which its strategy is based when taking decisions to increase transparency and market awareness. I also think that increased economic governance would need a counterpoint, a balance: but this is not the fault of Mr Trichet. It is our fault for not yet having approved the Lisbon Treaty, and this is something which I would like to see remedied.

 Madam President, I will do my best not to repeat some of the comments already made. I must, however, point out that the first time I heard of sovereign wealth funds was the 1993 ‘KIO scandal’ in Spain, which, according to the Kuwaiti authorities of the time, caused more economic damage than Saddam Hussein’s invasion in 1991. Other names have emerged since then. We have already talked about Gazprom, Chinese activity in Africa and Venezuela’s use of the funds to export the Bolivarian revolution, and we will be talking more today as a result of the financial crisis. Many companies are being bought up or receiving financial assistance through these funds. As Mrs Kauppi said on behalf of my group, it is true that the funds have some unquestionable advantages: they help improve allocation of resources, they inject liquidity and reduce volatility, and these are all very useful at this particular juncture. Some of the concerns aroused by the funds have also been mentioned: more extensive government intervention in economies, intervention that may occasionally be dictated by political rather than economic objectives – which can lead to market distortions and threats to national security – and the national reaction of each government, which could further fragment the internal market. To paraphrase Lenin, what is to be done? Obviously we must continue to investigate how these funds operate and produce an accurate diagnosis of their workings, and the Community framework must be reviewed. It is true that they are subject to rules on competence and investor protection, but is this sufficient? We must also come up with a voluntary code of conduct to guarantee transparency, predictability and accountability. Finally, the code of conduct ought to be exported to the international framework. I thus extend a hearty welcome to transatlantic cooperation and cooperation with bodies such as the OECD and the International Monetary Fund. Action must be taken, and it must be taken soon.

 Madam President, the recent financial crises have shown the importance of high-quality accounting standards for the proper functioning of the markets. This being the case, it seems to me that another lesson of the crisis is that there is a certain asymmetry between the stated importance of accounting standards and the nature and operation of the private entities responsible for setting, producing and interpreting those standards. Mr Radwan’s report is therefore correct to point out that the first matter to be dealt with is that of governance. In my view he has put forward intelligent and realistic proposals about the need for the institutions representing the Union to be more proactive in this process of setting standards which are to be incorporated into the Community legal order, also concerning the internal operating rules of those private entities. Greater transparency, safeguards to prevent conflicts of interest and broader geographical representation are some of the proposals which Mr Radwan has put forward. The second aspect dealt with in the report is the matter of small and medium-sized undertakings. We have emphasised here in the House the need to reconcile two objectives: simplification and reduced cost of accounting procedures for SMEs and the provision of adequate information for market players. The last point covered by Mr Radwan – and one with which I concur – is the need for global standards in a global environment. Therefore it is extremely important to reach agreements with the other major world financial markets, notably the United States. This calls for greater dynamism and a more significant role for the European institutions, including this Parliament and all those listening today.

Madam President, Commissioner, in my speech I plan to use the so-called case method, that is to say, I am going to try to draw conclusions from a single specific event that may be applicable in a general sense. As the honourable Member knows, on several occasions I have concerned myself with the issue of the takeover bids that have taken place in Spain against the Endesa electricity company. My fellow Member from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has referred to national champions and I believe that this case fits perfectly within that context. As you know, the current Spanish Government did everything it could to prevent a German company, E.ON, from acquiring a stake in Endesa, and that conduct has already led the Commission to open up two procedures. One against the general decision empowering a particular committee to lay down specific conditions, and the other relating to those specific conditions. The Commissioner is perfectly aware of what I am talking about. Then a stake in Endesa was acquired by an Italian company, which is partly public, incidentally. I put a question to the Commissioner and received a reply today in which she says that the restrictions to the right to vote laid down by the Spanish Government are being investigated. The third chapter in this case is that the person responsible, the President of the National Energy Commission, the Spanish regulatory body, appointed by the Socialist Government, has handed in his resignation to that same Socialist Government, in protest against what he considers to be violations of his independence. That is what he explained to the Spanish Parliament. Unfortunately, we have not been able to get him to explain it in this Parliament, although I have not given up hope that there will be full and open transparency here as well. I would like to know whether the Commissioner, the Commission, is worried about this issue that affects the proper operation of the entire European market, and is an issue for the whole of Europe, and which, if you will allow me, also affects legal security, the good name and good credit in the international markets of my country, and please believe me, Commissioner, that is what is of most concern to me. I would like the Commissioner to tell me whether she has carried out any investigations, whether she intends to do so, whether she intends to address this problem with the Socialist government and whether she intends to carry out reforms with a view to combating it. Thank you, Madam President, I have exceeded my speaking time somewhat because my spokesman, Mr Evans, has not been here and I felt that I could make use of his time; in any event I would like to thank you.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Schwab’s defence of Mr Lauk’s report was so brilliant and so accurate that I am going to continue broadly in the same vein as him. I share Mr Schwab's concern with regard to the progress of public debt. We grew much more last year than in previous years, we have come closer to our growth potential, but public debt remains below the limits that we ourselves set in the Treaty of Maastricht. According to all of the indicators, we will have good growth next year, but we will grow less than last year, and that means that public debt will continue to cause concern. I would once again agree with the rapporteur and the Commissioner in saying that this concern is all the more urgent if we take account of the projections on the development of the population, what is known as the ageing of the population, which may be one of the great challenges of the century we have just begun. Life expectancy is increasing, birth rates are still extremely low, and that means that the working-age population will be smaller and that, therefore, sooner or later, the labour market will contract and, as a result, we will have far more beneficiaries of the system and far fewer people contributing to the social security coffers. Neither I nor Mr Schwab, who is a Christian Democrat like me, believe that the viability of the social protection system can be called into question. We need to seek foundations to strengthen it, which make it possible for us to fulfil our social obligations. There are certain recommendations in Mr Lauk’s report that I would like to stress, and I shall add a few of my own. I agree that we should establish comparable bases for the budgets so that we can make comparisons homogeneous, but I would like us to borrow an accounting technique from the private sector, a form of budget forecasting, in order to take account of the obligations of which we are aware. It seems to me to be obvious that we should take advantage of good times to reduce public debt further, but we are not doing so, or we are not doing so sufficiently. Thirdly, I believe that we must rethink our entire system of public spending and revenue in order to make our economies more productive, so that we have more resources, amongst other things in order to meet social welfare spending needs. I believe that we should stop looking at the retirement age as something that represents an obligation and think in terms of a right that opens up the possibility of retiring and orient public finances, since we are talking about public finances, in a way that encourages people to remain in work for longer. Finally, I believe that we should consider replacing social security contributions, as a fundamental core – practically the only one – of social protection systems, with a system of taxes, essentially value-added tax, which the presidential candidate Sarkozy has brilliantly described as ‘social VAT’ in the debate that is taking place in that country. I would like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, who is not here today, the person representing him and the Commissioner on having taken up the majority of our positions.

The representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mrs in 't Veld, began her speech by saying that Mr Bullmann’s report was a good report, as previous reports on the broad economic guidelines had also been, but that those fine words had not been turned into concrete action, that we have never been able to move beyond the talking stage. In the short space of time available to me, I am going to focus on the institutional reforms. A period of reflection on the Constitutional Treaty has been opened up and is now on the point of being concluded, and practically everybody has expressed their opinion. Mrs Merkel is proposing a roadmap; the Socialist candidate Ségolène Royal, to question the role of the Central Bank; the presidential candidate Sarkozy, the reforms that need to be introduced in order to make the Treaty viable. Everybody talks about this issue apart from us. I know that Mr Almunia believes that the great economic Treaty was Maastricht, and that may be true, but in Marxist terms, what Maastricht did was change the economic structures. It now falls to us to change the political superstructures, to bring the institutional architecture into line with these changes. I would propose that Parliament become involved and produce a few lines on what the Commissioner, from his vantage point, believes should be introduced in the Constitutional Treaty. An exercise of this kind was carried out in Group VI in the European Convention that failed, but the list remains in force. What are our views about what should be done on the Union's list of economic objectives? How do we believe, and how far do we believe, the codecision procedure should be extended in the field of economic policies? What should we do about the power of retrieval in the Lamfalussy procedure? How can we guarantee the democratic control of the European Central Bank without undermining its independence? What should we do about economic governance (this morning, the Italian President, Mr Napolitano, referred to the need for greater economic coordination)? What should the President-in-Office of the Council do? Here we are still saying nothing though. In the area of taxation, and I shall end here, all we need to do is incorporate into the Treaty what jurisprudence has already said, a single definition of tax domicile, an agreement on double taxation, the application of the non-discrimination principle, and I shall not go on because my time has run out. What I propose, Mr Almunia, is that you produce a few lines and bring it to that dialogue that we approved in previous broad economic guidelines, and that we reach agreement so that we can speak with one voice and make constructive proposals in this reform of the Constitutional Treaty, because tomorrow it will be too late.

Commissioner, I regret that I do not share your opinion. The Commission’s proposal has been born with two original sins. Firstly, it does not distinguish between citrus and other horticultural products, it does not distinguish between trees and plants, and secondly, it rewards those who do not work and penalises those who work well. In addition to these two original sins, it has not taken account of four proposals by the Government of Valencia and the Government of Murcia: the creation of a crisis fund to help maintain the market, the prohibition of new planting, an increase in controls of the origin of citrus fruits from other countries and finally to promote, with Community funding, a global restructuring plan for citrus fruits to adapt production to market demands.

 Mr President, this is the first time that Parliament has debated a report on the economic situation in the euro zone and I therefore regard this report as being of unique importance, particularly as this debate – this analysis that we are conducting jointly for the first time – is taking place at a time when the situation is both politically complex and economically uncertain. I say it is politically complex because, as we are dealing with institutional issues here, I cannot ignore the fact that the debate on what to do with the Constitutional Treaty is still ongoing. Another point that I cannot ignore, either, is that this report is being debated within a ‘new era’ in terms of monetary policy – with interest rates that have been rising for some time and threaten to keep on rising – and at a stage when we are embarking on the new Stability and Growth Pact as revised by the Commission, and when the Member States are for the first time coming before the European institutions to account for what they have done regarding the Lisbon Strategy in their national reform plans. I say that the situation is economically confused because, while I agree with the Commission’s view that the economic situation is good, or at least much better than it was previously, I must emphasise that our potential 2% growth is not enough to absorb Europe’s unemployed, to keep pace with our competitors or to maintain our standard of living. As is customary in this House, this report is divided into several sections: macroeconomic policy; reforms, with special emphasis on the internal market; and institutional issues, focusing on economic policy coordination and external representation. In the area of macroeconomic policy, there is nothing really new other than what we said in the debate on the broad economic guidelines. What the doctor prescribes for our macroeconomic policy is more stability, more stability and more stability. On monetary policy, the point that we highlight – and I repeat that we are highlighting institutional issues – is that we would like to see greater transparency and openness in the European Central Bank. We would like to know why it does what it does, and how it manages and takes into account the two pillars on which it bases its decisions. That is why we are asking for short minutes to be published showing the arguments for and against a particular decision. On the subject of budgetary policy, this report’s first finding is that monetary policy may be losing the momentum that it has shown so far, and budgetary policy must take up the torch. That, as I have highlighted before, leads us to call on the Commission to adhere to a strict interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact, and on the Member States to work harder at cutting their deficits, especially in good times. Something new that we are calling for is greater coordination of Member States’ fiscal calendars and of the economic forecasts that they use in making their budgetary projections. It does not make sense for countries taking part in the European Economic Union to use different forecasts of oil prices or of interest or exchange rate trends; in our dialogue with the national parliaments, we should like everyone to know what we are talking about. On the matter of public debt, we also call on the Member States, as usual, to make a greater effort to cut public debt in order to free up resources and to address the Lisbon Strategy and the budgetary challenges that will result from the ageing of our population. The last point – which has been repeated already – is to review our fiscal systems in order to enhance the competitiveness of Europe’s economy. With regard to reforms, we prescribe Lisbon and more Lisbon. We want the public to see how well each Member State is performing. We therefore call for a code of conduct that will enable us to put greater pressure on the slowest countries and, through the dissemination of good practice, enable them to see how countries at the top of the class operate. Regarding the internal market, we need freedom and more freedom, in contrast to the protectionist temptations that we have seen in recent years, as well as development of the services market. In short, we want consolidation of fundamental freedoms. As regards institutional issues – I want to focus on improving the way the Union operates – we call for a trialogue between the Council, the Commission and Parliament to take place quarterly, in parallel with the dialogue that we have with the European Central Bank, although I am aware that the Commissioner is not enamoured with the idea. To facilitate this trialogue, we ask that the Eurogroup draw up a roadmap showing which way the euro zone will be heading in the next two years. We call on the Commission to provide us, in subsequent reports, with a more specific toolbox in order to promote such talks, and we invite the Commissioner and the Council to meet with us every three months. On the matter of external representation, we find that it is not consistent with the international weight of the euro. We are pleased that the Member States spoke with one voice at the meetings of the international institutions in Singapore, and we call for greater coordination and imagination to ensure that the Member States are represented as a single entity in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international bodies. I am grateful to all the shadow rapporteurs and all my fellow Members for the efforts that they have made.

Mr President, Commissioners, the discussion of the broad economic policy guidelines has given us many headaches in previous years. In order to make sure the headache is not so severe this year, I shall restrict myself to three questions: why has Parliament decided to produce a report despite the fact that the Commission has chosen to ratify the previous reports? What can we do to ensure that our reports are heard? And thirdly, what is it that we want the Commission to hear? Firstly, why a report? Because previous reports contained masses of recommendations that the Commission has not taken into account. Secondly, because, since we discussed the previous report, new factors have arisen: the relative failure of the European Constitution, a new financial perspective, some first interest rate rises, three candidates seeking to join the eurozone, and the Doha Round, which continues the Hong Kong trade talks. Secondly, because there are certain factors that we have taken up in other reports, but which have become more important over time. Commissioner Almunia referred to the ageing of the population and we should also talk about the consequences of immigration, the consequences of Chinese imports, once the quantitative restrictions have come to an end, about world imbalances, essentially in relation to the United States, and finally the energy crisis. What can we do in order to be heard? This report has been drawn up in a spirit of consensus, which has obliged many of us to give way on our particular points of view, and I would like in particular to thank all of the representatives of the other parliamentary groups for doing so. If we want to be heard, the first thing I must point out here is that previously we have not been heard. This report begins with a kind of catalogue of grievances, a list of recommendations that we have made and that the Commission has not taken up. We asked for a transposition of directives, which has not happened, a reduction of deficits — Commissioner Almunia has pointed out that 12 of the 25 Member States are currently in a situation of excessive deficit — a communication on globalisation in order to make clear to the public the opportunities and challenges it presents — and if this communication had been produced, it would have spared us a few headaches — and we also called for the application of the charters on small and medium-sized businesses, something which has not been done. Secondly, this report deals with what we might call institutional issues, whether of a constitutional nature or not. During this period of active reflection — which is neither a reflection nor active — we are dealing with those questions which were left over from the Convention and which have not been answered: what are the Union’s objectives and competences? What are the responsibilities of the European Central Bank, while respecting its independence at all times? What should we do in order to reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact? What are the legal bases for modifying taxation in the Union and in the Member States? There is one explicit recommendation that I would ask the Commission to take particular note of: this Parliament will not approve any directive by means of the Lamfalussy procedure if the problem of call-back is not resolved by 2008, ultimately the international representation of the eurozone. The Vice-President of the Commission has referred to coordinating the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines within a single document: it is true, but they are still subject to different information and consultation procedures which make them difficult to understand. Furthermore, it is necessary to incorporate other documents in order to ensure that it is not fragmentary. With regard to taxation in an institutional sense, we call upon the Commission to respond to what the High Court of Justice has said: a uniform definition of tax residence, as an extension of citizenship, the principle of non-discrimination and a convention on double taxation. With regard to coordination, I was pleased with Commissioner Almunia’s kind words: it is true that we have to coordinate more, we must make a precise diagnosis, draw up a correct cure, an analysis of what has happened and define the role of the Eurogroup. In the field of macroeconomic policy, we do not go into the issue of interest rates, we do not express our opinion. We do say that we have to do everything possible to ensure that prices do not rise and interest stays low. We refer to public debt, in terms used by the Commissioner: less interest, less repayments, means more spending on ageing, more Lisbon. With regard to the business climate, we call for serious reflection. The United States are ahead of us. 144 of the world’s top companies are from the European Union, while in the case of the United States, that figure stands at 206. Small and medium-sized businesses double their employment in the first two years, something that does not happen in Europe. We are calling for positive discrimination to be applied in favour of small and medium-sized businesses, with particular reference to the funding of risk capital. In the field of taxation, to put it in simple terms, we ask that Home State Taxation be used for companies in application of the principle of place of origin with regard to VAT. I have nothing to say with regard to human capital. My colleague has expressed this very well. In the field of investment: trans-European networks. It would take twenty years to finish them. Energy, R+D+I, more market, more competition, more competitiveness. (Applause)

Mr President, I am going to take notice of my compatriot Sánchez Presedo and talk about the takeover bids – plural – for the company, Endesa. What has the Spanish Socialist Government done in this case? Firstly, it has systematically occupied all of the regulatory bodies and the Competition Court. For the first time in the history of Spanish democracy, the three are presided over by persons of known political affiliation. Secondly, it has blatantly supported a particular takeover bid for Endesa, to the extent that the Council of Ministers approved it contrary to the opinion-report of the Competition Court. Thirdly, it has built a wall − repeated today by the Minister for the Economy and the Minister for Industry − to prevent the takeover bid by another Community company. To the Prime Minister’s cry of ‘they shall not pass’, the Minister for Industry deployed all of his ‘weapons of mass obstruction’ to the point of changing the rules of the game in the middle of the match − which incidentally had to be rectified during the stage between the Cabinet and the Official State Bulletin − turning Spain into a kind of banana republic in which legal certainty is trampled upon. If we are to talk about economic patriotism, what Spain needs in order to continue growing and creating employment is more competition rather than more protectionism, more liberalism rather than political interference or haggling, more energy security, which means integration into Europe, rather than continuing to be an island where energy is concerned. I would ask the Commission, firstly, to clear up the political doubts surrounding these operations. As soon as the takeover bid took place, I asked the Commissioner to seek a resolution of the issue, because I warned her of the political risks involved in that bid. She did not wish to do so, and that has brought us to where we are today. Secondly, I would ask that the application of the competition rules as they stand be guaranteed. Thirdly, as she has said, I would ask for integration into a common market, which will be the only way to ensure energy sufficiency and cheap energy and into an internal market, which is what we want to see. That is Spanish patriotism and it is also European patriotism.

Mr President, I shall begin by saying that I am going to vote in favour of the compromise, that I much prefer the compromise to the original directive, and that I shall focus on a single issue: the reimbursement of costs generated by a citizen from one Member State for services they have received in another Member State. If the President will allow me to employ the case method, I shall use the example of the Valencian Community, although I could be referring to any other region, an Italian region for example. We receive more tourists every day; every day more European citizens acquire a second home there; every day we receive more citizens who come to be treated in our Valencian Community, exclusively, given the quality of its medical services. This pressure poses a threat to the health services. This financial pressure is difficult for us to endure. On numerous occasions, the Court of Justice has acknowledged that, pursuant to Articles 49 and 50 of the EC Treaty and the regulations implementing them, the Member State providing medical services has the right to be reimbursed by the State of the citizen being treated. But in practice the reality is that this right is not respected, that this right is a purely rhetorical statement. The Commission has taken the view that this Directive is a good instrument for making this right a reality, and this view is enshrined in Article 23. At the moment, I do not know what the situation is with Article 23 or the amendments intended to remove it. I shall simply express my desire that this article be retained as drawn up by the Commission. I would call upon the Commissioner not to restrict himself to making a formal statement promising once again that the problem will be resolved. We want this article to be approved as it is, and that is how I shall vote.

Mr President, since I agree entirely with the report produced by my group colleague, Mr Hökmark, I shall be very specific and deal exclusively with the issues that I would like to emphasise. With regard to the general philosophy, I agree that, since State aid is a form of competition policy aimed at creating an even playing field amongst the different companies, we should insist not just on aid that takes the form of subsidies and which therefore belongs in the public spending chapter, but also on those fiscal incentives that do not respond to the nature of the tax, but which respond to the desire to stimulate certain activities in geographical areas, that is to say the same intention as direct aid. With regard to research, development and innovation, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur in particular on the extension of the scope of beneficiaries, to expressly include universities amongst the possible beneficiaries of this kind of aid. I would also like to congratulate him — and I am now addressing the Commissioner — on his comments in the field of risk capital. If one thing explains the differences in growth between the United States and Europe, it is dynamism, the power of its small and medium-sized companies, not so much in terms of net birth rate, which is more or less the same, but in terms of US small businesses’ greater capacity for growth in the first two years, which requires a degree of funding. And in the field of risk capital we are a long way behind. If my figures are accurate, while risk capital represents 0.45% of United States GDP, European risk capital is less than 0.14%. On the issue of regional aid – my final point – I would also stress what Mr Koterec has said, but I would like to add an aspect that has not been mentioned: it would not make sense also to take State aid away from regions that stop receiving Structural Funds as a result of natural growth, and not just for statistical reasons, as the rapporteur has said. If the Commissioner will allow me, therefore, I would like to correct paragraph 36 on this issue, to include regions losing funds for statistical reasons and those that lose them through natural growth. I congratulate the rapporteur once again.
 José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE

Mr President, I shall make three observations and a final comment. Since many of the amendments drawn up by the rapporteur have been rejected, the report that we have just voted on contains certain absurdities which this Parliament cannot ignore. Paragraph six, as it is now worded, and not as it should have been worded according to the rapporteur’s report, obliges the national and regional legislator to introduce a series of specific actions which fall within their exclusive competence. I am not invoking the principle of subsidiarity here: this is a clear encroachment of competences. This is also true of the erratum
, which is intended to suspend the application of a legitimate law, approved by a legitimate regional parliament and not invalidated by the Constitutional Court: this is a blatant encroachment of competences by this Parliament. Secondly, recital J, also contrary to the amendment by the rapporteur, and on the instigation of the Spanish Socialists, refers to the existence of illegal actions. As the President knows, under any rule of law, any action as a result of illegal actions must be applied, determined and enforced by a court, in accordance with a very ancient principle: nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege
. (The President cut off the speaker)
 José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE
). –  
(ES) 
Mr President, I would like to make two preliminary points before getting into the issue in question. Firstly, the complaints we are discussing here are directed at a legitimate law, approved by a regional parliament in accordance with its competences and not invalidated by the Constitutional Court. Secondly, the judgments that we are issuing in no sense relate to illegal acts: Spain is a country with guarantees, with an open legal system, which culminates in the European Courts, and it falls to them to make moral judgments according the clear principle of criminal law of nullum crimen nulla poena sine lege.
 I understand the considerations that Mr Guardans has expressed and I would not have tolerated an encroachment of the competences either of the regional Parliament or of the national Parliament or the Spanish courts. It does fall to this Parliament  and Mrs Fourtou has done this with unrivalled elegance  to deal with the citizens’ petitions and to make recommendations; recommendations, incidentally, that the current government of the Valencian Country have taken up with great generosity and intelligence. What this Parliament cannot do is try to take over the job of land-planning that is the responsibility of the regional authorities, which is the impression I got from the speech – in English I believe – by my compatriot Joan i Marí. Secondly, a moratorium cannot be established either, because that falls to the regional Parliament. Thirdly, this Parliament cannot establish compensation: an administrative authority cannot pay compensation without a judicial judgment or an administrative resolution without being guilty of the misappropriation of funds. Finally, this Parliament is not the place, as Mr Guardans has said quite rightly — and I address this to Mr Calabuig — for a political trial. Mr Calabuig has not said that the law that we are discussing was decided upon by the Socialist majority to which he belongs, and not by the majority to which I belong. Secondly, he has not said that he is the author of an amendment that states that the petitions focus on the last three years, a period during which Mr Camps’ government has been in power; the petitions come from a long time before that and his politically-inspired intention is for the regional government to be blamed, because it is that government — so far with little success, by the way, and long may that continue — that he wants to bring down. In this regard I agree with Mr Guardans: it is not proper, it is not morally correct, to use this Parliament to blacken the name of a Community, of a legitimately elected Parliament and of a government supported by the citizens.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by clarifying what we are talking about, because, on the basis of a speech by Commissioner McCreevy, it seems to me that his ideas do not coincide with those of Mr Kovács, within the Commission itself, and of course do not coincide with those of this Parliament, not even with regard to the subject of the discussion. What we are talking about now is establishing common rules for defining the tax base. We are not talking about harmonising or approximating tax rates, which will remain in the hands of the Member States. Having clarified that, why am I in favour of consolidating the tax base and why do I approve and applaud the report by Mr Bersani? Firstly, because I believe in an internal market that works. And in order for an internal market to work, companies that operate throughout the market, multinational companies, cannot be subject to twenty-five different rules when it comes to defining what is taxable income and what is deductible spending. Secondly, because I am in favour of the European citizen, and the European citizen who wishes to invest his or her savings in a company will be able to judge the assets of companies with more clarity if they are all defined according to the same rules. Thirdly, because I do not like tax fraud, and I believe that by consolidating the tax base we will be able to eliminate transfer pricing and the location of company operations in those countries that are most permissive in terms of not taking account of an item of spending or being able to deduct an operation. Finally, because if we say here that we advocate fiscal competition amongst the Member States, competition will be cleaner, more transparent and, if I may say so, more brutal, if the different States apply different rates — the rates they want to apply — to homogenous realities. Because that will be the only way to calculate it I would like to end with a warning, Mr President: if we do not do it, as we have done in the case of the code of conduct, the Court of Justice will do it, to the shame of this Parliament.
 José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE

(ES) 
Mr President, I entirely agree with Mr Becsey’s speech, and I will therefore focus entirely on the reduced rate of value added tax applied to highly labour-intensive services. All the opinion polls carried out in Europe indicate that the Europeans have two concerns: finding work and being certain that there will be resources to maintain the Welfare State. A lot has been written with a view to reassuring the citizens in this regard, but little has been done. Plenty of words and no action. Probably one of the few concrete initiatives to have been taken in this area has been the establishment of a reduced value added tax on services that create employment, services that promote the contracting of workers, in particular the least qualified. A reduced VAT rate that also brings to the surface resources which were previously submerged, and which can be used to fund future pensions. And a reduced VAT on work that enables us to rebalance the unstable relationship between taxes on capital and taxes on work. The situation at the moment is that this experiment, which began in 2000, may come to an end unless it is extended. And the Council still has no opinion; the Council does not know and has no reply. I would like to say to the Commissioner that he can do much more than he has said in his speech. The Commissioner can put pressure on the Council: he can tell it that it is not a good idea to end this experiment just when new States are being incorporated, States in which the problems we have been resolving — the lack of jobs, the black economy — are more pressing than in the old States; that it is not a good idea to end an experiment, and thereby risk an increase in prices and a reduction in employment; that it is not a good idea to end this experiment just when we are about to discuss the Directive on services, which has created such concern in terms of employment in the Member States, and the Commissioner can tell it that this Parliament is unanimous and that this Parliament does not like to be treated as a joke, especially when the Council is not offering any well-founded opinion in return.

Madam President, I would like to return to the issue raised by Mr Pinheiro, the Gas Natural-Endesa takeover bid. This takeover bid has raised serious doubts in Spain in terms of its effect on competition and on its compatibility with the Treaties. My question is very simple: what are the regulatory time limits for notifying an operation of this nature? Has any government or any competition body of any Member State asked the Commission to intervene so far? If so, when did it do so?

Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to our Chamber. My role in this debate consists exclusively of explaining what has happened in this Parliament during comitology and expressing my full support for the position of the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Radwan. The problems in relation to comitology began some years ago now, when the Commission presented Parliament with the financial services action plan, which proposed the rapid implementation of forty-something measures in the field of financial services. We were told at that point that the ordinary legislative procedure was too slow to keep up to date with the speed of the financial markets. I spoke here to say that, in the vast majority of cases, Parliament was not responsible for this delay, but rather the Council. The next step was what we know as the Lamfalussy report, after the person in charge of drawing it up, who, with a view to providing a solution, to adapting the speed of the procedure to the speed of the markets, proposed splitting the legislation into two levels. First level: general principles, basic guidelines. Second level: concrete legal rules. Level one, codecision. Level two, complete exclusion of Parliament. We were asked to surrender the prerogatives that should be the privileges, the basic rules, of any European Parliament. It is quite understandable that the European Parliament should express its suspicion. We simply wanted to be in the same position as the Council. In the event that boundaries were overstepped, in the event that the attorney did not keep to the limits of their mandate, we wanted a call-back. It was not possible at that time, because the Treaties did not allow it, and we were waiting for the Constitution. We have reached a transitional situation — and I would stress transitional — and I would therefore call for the sunset clause that Mr Radwan has mentioned. Until then it will be necessary to reach an agreement that harmonises the two objectives: speed in the legislative procedure and respect for Parliament’s powers, powers which, as is the case for any Parliament, have been hard won over time. I would like finally to explain our suspicion by recalling a Spanish politician renowned for his skill and ability in fiddling the rules, who said, ‘you make the law, but leave it to me to make the regulation’. That is the danger we are worried about.

Mr President, please believe that as a Spaniard and as a Valencian, I was extremely apprehensive about this report. I shall begin by saying that all my fears have been allayed by my colleague Mr Queiró’s report, and I shall therefore restrict myself to reiterating certain ideas, emphasising others and adding some new ones. The report starts by stressing the importance of tourism from the cultural and economic points of view. From a cultural perspective, and given that we have referred to our own personal experiences, I believe that the transition from dictatorship to democracy in my country was possible because we wanted to be like the other Europeans, and we knew what Europeans were like because of the phenomenon of tourism. In addition, thanks to the phenomenon of tourism, Spain was able to begin to leave behind poverty and take off towards a new economic horizon. This would have justified more emphatic treatment in the Treaties, something that did not happen. Since then, however, new developments have taken place, such as the increase in travel, in new technologies, in life expectancy and in incomes, all of which favour tourism amongst senior citizens. I would also like to say at this point that I entirely support the proposal Mr Yáñez will make in this field. I know he has not spoken yet, but he has been kind enough to tell me about it in advance — pure intelligence is what is required. It has to be recognised that the increase in tourism has caused certain problems in terms of sustainability, ecological balance, physical security, food safety, legal security in the field of delays, non-compliance with contracts, time-sharing and competitiveness. All of these have been emphasised here. At this point I would like once again to stress the importance of the issue of value added tax in the special system for travel agencies and the reduced rate, to which Mrs Sudre has referred. Commissioner, I would like to raise something new which is not in the report, namely compensation from the states of origin to the host states for health services provided by the latter. I believe this to be an extremely important issue. I shall end by congratulating my colleague from the bottom of my heart on his wonderful work. I take my hat off to you, Mr Queiró.

Mr President, Commissioner, we have often discussed the Stability Pact and I am going to try to summarise some of the things that have been said. My spokesman, Mr Radwan, has said something that I agree with: we are beating the retreat. The Pact I liked was the Pact of 1996, which was signed by the CDU Minister Theo Waigel and defended by your predecessor, Commissioner Solbes. We have not been able to maintain it. The Council noted that there was generalised non-compliance in Europe, and it could have done two things: it could have demanded compliance or, euphemistically, it could have made the Pact more flexible, and that is exactly what it has done. You are appearing here to explain to us the modifications that need to be made to the Regulations in order to make this Pact effective. What could Parliament do? What could my group do? We could have produced amendments aimed at reviving the previous Pact, in the form it then took. We have not done that because, following Ortega’s advice, we do not like pointless efforts, which only lead to melancholy. We have presented some amendments, which Mr Karas has explained very well. The intention is to ensure that the disaster does not get any worse. Our intention is to ensure that it is applied properly, in technical terms, with reliable statistics, we want to reduce the margin for arbitrariness, filling in the legal gaps, in short, we want to ensure that the retreat is not a complete disaster. It has been said here that Europe is not going well and that is the case. But if it is not going well, it is not a result of the Stability Pact, but rather of our not having complied with that Pact. The Stability Pact, budgetary authority, to put it in quasi-theological terms, is a virtue, a necessary condition, though insufficient, for growth. Furthermore, as Mrs Kauppi has pointed out, we need those reforms that we have been unable to carry out. Parliament is helping you; it is helping you to reduce the Governments’ margin for discretion. It is up to you to ensure that this does not get any worse.

Madam President, I too would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Böge, because he has been able to send a crystal clear message to the Commission and the Council indicating what this Parliament wants. How much money are we prepared to spend on the European project? What financial effort are we prepared to dedicate to the process of European integration at a time when Europe is facing difficulties, when it is at a crossroads? The rapporteur proposes less than the Commission, but more than the Council has proposed this afternoon. The President-in-Office of the Council says that we must create balances. I would stress what Mr Elles has said: balances are required, but we should remind the Council that with less money we will not create more Europe, we will create less Europe at a time when we need to re-affirm this project. The referenda that have been held in recent days, as many speakers have mentioned, have reminded us of the need to focus on the real needs of our citizens, and they want us to grow more quickly. In order to do that, we must create more jobs, we must be more productive, we must spend more money on investment, research and development. In short, we must implement the Lisbon reforms. And in order to do that, we need money. Our citizens have also reminded us that they believe in a social model in which both cohesion and the efficiency of the market are priorities. Without a policy of correcting territorial imbalances, the economic project represented by the European Union could probably survive. What would not survive would be the political project that is at stake here. We must convince our citizens that together we can deal with our future challenges: the challenges of globalisation, of competition from emerging countries, of relocation of companies and the ageing of the population. And in order to do that we need more money. As an additional and final point, I would like to express my strong opposition to the beginning of co-funding of the agricultural policy, since that will also mean breaking the social cohesion rules on which the model we believe in has been based.

Mr President, I do not intend to take up too much time talking about the measures in the two reports that we are discussing. I agree one hundred percent with the comments made by Mr Hökmark. I would like, Mr President, to focus for a moment on the analysis. Europe is not working well. Mr Goebbels has not wished to rub salt in the wounds, he has given a rosy view of the situation and so has Mr Almunia. He says that the conditions are in place for Europe to work properly, but the population knows that it is not going well. The enormous pessimism amongst all our populations has been very visible in the debates that are currently taking place in relation to the referenda in France and in the Netherlands. We are growing less than the United States, we are creating less employment, we are less productive and we are very far from achieving the Lisbon objectives. This enormous pessimism has led our populations to express perfectly understandable fears. How are we going to deal with the challenges of globalisation? How are we going to deal with the competition from the emerging countries? We are currently discussing the problem of the textile sector and competition from Eastern countries will soon bring further problems. How are we going to prevent the relocation of companies? How are we going to deal with the challenge of immigration? How are we going to safeguard a welfare state threatened by the ageing of the population? These fears are increasing because the response of the institutions has been weak. We have discussed the Stability and Growth Pact – and we are continuing to do so – and we should make it very clear that we have reached a situation of mass non-compliance, a kind of amnesty, and we have ignored the strictest rules for ensuring budgetary stability. We are incapable of establishing the financial perspectives and all the signs are that we want to spend less money on the Union. With less money, we will not create more Europe, but rather less Europe. As my colleagues have pointed out, we are a very long way from implementing the reforms we need to make. This Parliament has sent a good message by bringing together the two reports we are debating today and trying to eliminate discrepancies so that the message is clear. It now falls to the Commission and the Council to oblige the Member States to comply with what is decided here. It is true that we are going to discuss the national programmes when they are drawn up, but I hope that the Commission is not content simply to be a letter box nor that it restrict itself to politely praising the national programmes, but that it will demand that the States demonstrate courage, determination and audacity, which is what is needed in order to put an end to the enormous pessimism that I have intended to describe here.

Mr President, I agree with the Commission President's conclusions. I believe that Europe is currently standing at a crossroads. Europe could enter a crisis period if the Constitutional Treaty is not ratified either now or in a few years' time, that is, if we are unable to define Europe in a way that affirms our political and economic identity to the outside world. We need to be defining Europe now in line with the mandate of the current Commission and of this House. To do that, in economic terms – which is what we are considering today – macro-economic stability is essential. The other minimum requirement is speeding up the Lisbon reform process in order to increase employment and productivity, and therefore competitiveness, which will narrow the gap between us and the United States and enable us to stand up to competition from emerging countries. We discussed the Lisbon reforms this morning, so I am going to return to the importance of the Stability Pact. I feel that we need to be very honest with one another on this matter. We are going to reform the Stability Pact not because its internal logic has failed, nor the ideas underpinning it, but rather for the simple reason that too many countries have failed to comply with its terms, notably the larger countries. Since it is the larger Member States who are forcing us to revise the Pact, we need to know what they are willing to do – which is what we have just heard. They are willing to accept reform of the preventative features of the Pact and to make an effort in the good times, simply because they know that no world power can force them to comply with the rules. In terms of prevention, they want to slacken and break the rules to the point where – as one German Social Democrat has said – there are no absolute rules. There are two options – and only two – in this state of affairs: either we move towards economic governance, economic coordination, and an independent judge incapable of imposing any sanctions, or we maintain the existing automatic procedures. We have not wanted to move ahead with economic coordination. The Intergovernmental Conference reversed all the tentative progress made by the Convention on the subject of coordination, leaving us in exactly the same position as before. Nor do we want to continue with the automatic processes. All that will happen in this Council and in future Councils is that we will move backwards. The question is how far will we backtrack, and at what pace? The exemptions to the rules we set ourselves amount to weakening, to giving ground on the Stability Pact. How much you are willing to concede will determine our future credibility, our economic strength, and will affect whether or not we avoid the economic crisis I anticipate in the coming years.

Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels, laments the lack of coordination of economic policies. I agree with that, but I reach a different conclusion. Without those coordination rules, making the Stability Pact more flexible would be equivalent to breaking it and breaking the Stability Pact would mean neutralising the Central Bank’s efforts to maintain prices, it would mean rises in interest rates, it would mean a delay in growth, which is what we all want, a delay in the implementation of the structural reforms and, more dangerously, a serious threat to the welfare state. The resources we spend on paying interests and paying off public debt will mean less resources for guaranteeing finances. What we need at the moment is more employment and more productivity. More employment, above all, means paying attention to those sectors of the population with most difficulties and we know that they are women, young people between 15 and 25 years old and people over 55. And more productivity means more investment, more effort in investment and development and more effort in education and professional training with a view to increasing the productivity of work. The Commissioner’ speech also reminds me – to quote Mr Goebbels once again – of those speeches of the defunct Soviet Union that said that the transition to socialism would inevitably end the following year. When they became aware that that transition was possible, they concluded that the transition was complete and that they had already arrived at communism. A few years later the Iron Curtain fell. There is no need to weaken macroeconomic stability, but it is essential that we continue to insist more strongly, more vigorously, on structural reforms as the only guarantee, the only serious formula, for achieving growth.

Mr President, in this final intervention I would like to emphasise three points. Firstly, it has been pointed out that the history of the Economic and Monetary Union has been one of success and that this is due to the work of the Bank. I agree with this statement by the rapporteur and I would urge the Governor of the Bank of Spain to continue focusing on price stability as the main objective and not to listen to the sirens’ songs from the left trying to lure him towards other objectives. Secondly, I would like to ask the President to tell the Commissioner, who is beside him, that his proposal to make the pact more flexible, the creation of an à la carte
 pact, represents a real time-bomb for prices, neutralising the efforts of the Central Bank, for interest rates and, therefore, for investment and employment, for pensions in the future and for the Lisbon reforms. Because if the pact is broken or made more flexible, we will need tomorrow's taxes to pay for today's obligations. Why are we not growing? Not because the governments have been disciplined in observing the pact, but because they have done quite the opposite and, furthermore, because they have not fulfilled the obligations we set for them in the Lisbon Pact and which appear in the broad economic guidelines. I would urge the two of you, the President of the Central Bank and the Commissioner, just as we achieved an integrated financial market through a financial services action plan, to produce a financial action plan establishing the reforms and objectives we must achieve, the barriers which are hindering growth and which hence need to be eliminated, the actions we must take and the timetable we must respect. Mr President, do not take any notice of the governments when they urge you to look the other way when fiscal decisions are not complied with. Rather than that, I would suggest that, like Ulysses, when you hear those sirens’ songs, you tie yourself to the mast and continue on the course which brings us so much success, and convince the Commissioner that that is the course to follow.

Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Basque Parliament on what happened 25 years ago, regardless of the course that Statute has taken, which I believe has been highly satisfactory. But Mr Ortuondo’s speech strikes me as somewhat grotesque, since what he suggests would be like not congratulating the French on the French Revolution because some of the subsequent laws have not been complied with.

Mr President, Commissioner Almunia has interpreted Shakespeare brilliantly. As in Mark Anthony’s funeral speech, he sings the praises of budgetary austerity but, at the same time, tells us that he has put in place the necessary explosives to bring down the pillars supporting it. The Commissioner advocates simple rules but, at the same time, he tells us that we must take account of the national circumstances of each country, which means there will be 25 different rules. What we were saying yesterday about the Stability Pact is still true today. It is absolutely true that we must maintain the austerity pact in order to maintain price stability; that budgetary austerity serves to free up resources for education, research and development in order to make the Lisbon process possible; and, above all, that it is necessary to meet the implicit, hidden, unbudgeted-for obligations resulting from the ageing of the population. What we were saying yesterday is still true today. And if we are saying other things, that is simply because we are treating the Stability Pact as done for. The Stability Pact was good, the bad thing was that it was not complied with. Secondly, Commissioner, all of those who have always been in the Stability Pact are the ones who are today applauding your measures and all of us who have always been in favour of the Stability Pact are the ones who are against the Commission’s proposal for making it flexible, unequal and discretionary. Thirdly, Commissioner, the applause of the governments is not disinterested applause. The Stability Pact is not a pact in favour of the governments, it is a pact against governments, for restricting their action, in order not to neutralise the actions of the Central Bank and in order to maintain price stability. And if it is a pact against the governments and in favour of the citizens – and in this regard I agree with what the chairperson of the committee has said – you will have the support of my group in enhancing the powers of the Commission, against the Council, and the powers of Parliament, as representative of the citizens, to defend that budgetary stability, which will provide the citizens with lower prices, lower interest rates for their mortgages and will help to guarantee that we will have resources in the future to attend to the needs of our pensioners and that we will not have squandered those resources by paying interest and paying off debt. The PPE-DE Group will support the Commissioner in this debate. But if the intention is to draw up rules that make the application of the Pact discretionary, unequal and ultimately unfair, in accordance with the ‘pacta sunt servanda
’ principle, the Commissioner will not have our support.

 Madam President, I am going to talk about the renewed social agenda. Allow me to begin by sincerely thanking the rapporteur Mr Silva Peneda for his work; given the contribution he has made to this House on matters of social policy and employment I think we could talk of the ‘Silva Peneda legacy’. Madam President, mistrust and fear have taken root in our societies: unemployment is growing and in my country is doing so in dramatic fashion. We have to turn this situation around and the social agenda should help achieve that. Economic progress and social progress are not divergent paths; quite the opposite: if we want to stimulate growth and provide more, better quality jobs then we need to and must implement the social agenda, starting with all that inspires the greatest consensus. There is no time to lose; we must not entrench ourselves in defensive positions but rather move beyond local, short-term interests and look to future generations. Social Europe should be an area that unites us and not divides us, because we are talking about common European interests. The social agenda cannot be separated from a renewed Lisbon Strategy, because economic success sustains social benefits and social benefits also contribute to economic success. In the coming years, Europe is facing a period of stagnation and the progressive ageing of its population. We cannot bury our heads in the sand; we need to modernise our social model, precisely in order to improve it and make it fairer and more sustainable. Madam President, there are structural weaknesses that are a heavy burden and prevent us from moving forward. We must rid ourselves of that burden and implement the social agenda.
 Juan Andrés Naranjo Escobar  (PPE-DE

(ES)
 Madam President, recognising a failure is the first step towards being in a position to achieve success. The conciliation has indeed failed, but not the chance to rebuild the dialogue, starting today. The difficulty lay not in the practicalities of individual derogation from the maximum 48-hour working week, because it was precisely to overcome that difficulty that Parliament offered long transitional periods; the problem stemmed from highly differing points of view when it came to establishing a Community rule with the ultimate aim of ensuring health and safety at work. The subsequent problem was also regulating on-call time in accordance with Court of Justice rulings. With regard to the main problem of the opt-out, it is my view that what the Council was offering was legally contradictory and, above all, went against what I consider to be essential elements for a Europe that cannot, and should not, relinquish its social dimension without losing its identity. It was unthinkable to allow into Community legislation a general, permanent law that went against the recommendation of the Commission which, in its social agenda, urges Member States to comply with the International Labour Organization convention. It was also possible to reach an agreement by acting on the set of exceptions and general rules; in addition, we could have made use of the contribution of social stakeholders who, if their independence is respected, can provide fair, effective agreements. In short, Parliament’s proposals contained solutions that could provide what companies need, that is, flexibility to adapt working hours to different workloads, because the fact is that no two sectors are the same, nor companies within each sector, and because what we need and what my country in particular needs – we hold the sad record of having the highest unemployment rate in the European Union – is for our companies to create more employment and fewer redundancies. Ladies and gentlemen, I am among those who are convinced that we need urgent reform of our social systems; I, too, believe it is entirely possible to reconcile economic efficiency with the hope for social improvements and to reconcile freedom with justice, which is precisely why we must establish limits and minimum social standards for all Member States.
 Juan Andrés Naranjo Escobar  (PPE-DE
). 
 – (ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by quoting word-for-word from your document presenting the renewed social agenda. It says, ‘The Commission also calls upon all Member States to set an example by ratifying and implementing the ILO Conventions …’ Today, however, we are here debating a directive intended to go against those criteria by allowing Member States to regulate working weeks of up to 60 or 65 hours averaged over three months. Is that consistent, Commissioner? Can we legislate against our own recommendations? The purpose of the directive is to lay down minimum rules to ensure workers’ health and safety by means of two instruments: rest periods and a limit on the working week. It contains exceptions to both cases, but we are not talking about exceptions, Commissioner, as you yourself said. No, we are talking purely and simply about derogations from one of the fundamental elements of the directive. Flexibility is no justification for this. An increase in working hours cannot be confused with the flexibility that businesses and workers need. The directive will make very ample provision for seasonal patterns, production peaks and the needs of certain activities. Something that is good for everyone, Commissioner, is attaining the goal of flexicurity, in other words succeeding in reconciling personal and family life with work. For that to happen we must work at developing a culture of cooperation and transparency and allow collective autonomy to play its part in organising working time. Mr President, when the Council adopted its common position in September, it was a bad day for social dialogue. I am convinced that we would now have an agreement if it had been left to collective autonomy to arrange and organise working time. I am sure that the day of the vote, when we all face up to our responsibility, will be a good day for everyone. It is good to reform, but it is also good to preserve those elements that unite us most and divide us least, that strengthen Europe and that can make social Europe emerge empowered from the challenge it now faces. We must press forward with both economic progress and social progress, because they cannot survive separately.
 Juan Andrés Naranjo Escobar  (PPE-DE

(ES)
 Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this social package will only be able to bear fruit and be effective if we are able to agree the substance of the key initiatives. It is obvious that unemployment is the greatest of all social ills which we must combat. It is what most destabilises a society and is at the root of other, lesser evils. Therefore, the best social policy is one which helps create jobs. We must move right away from the false dilemma between solidarity and competitiveness because they are not incompatible. However, in order to construct a healthy, effective social policy and eradicate poverty, we need growth and stability. Therefore our social model needs to come to terms with the new reality. Globalisation also brings opportunities: those who adapt come out as winners, those who do not as losers. Europe is facing neither a classic crisis of growth nor cyclical problems but profound changes; the welfare of future generations depends on our wisdom to take good decisions today. Population ageing and demographic decline have already reached Europe; they are not a threat but a reality: closing our eyes to them will not help at all. What answers can we give today to the many consequences of the trend? Very few. For example, we do not have the tools or the incentives to make flexible, planned retirement possible which will allow our people to work beyond the average age at which people leave the labour market. Achievement of a uniform level of protection against discrimination and exclusion is crucial but the mass of European legislation does not guarantee that discrimination has been eradicated; accordingly, work to eradicate these bad social practices needs to start in schools. School failure and drop-out rates are a tragedy of our times and may well be for the future. We have much riding on this area; this is where we have to focus our minds, focus the added value the Union can bring, to end the situation and put a stop to it. In short, ladies and gentlemen, we do not need to abandon our social model, but renew it, giving it greater flexibility, greater mobility and greater security so that the most vulnerable are not left by the wayside.
 Juan Andrés Naranjo Escobar  (PPE-DE
). –  
(ES)
 Mr President, first, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur and the Commissioner for this initiative. Social exclusion and poverty are two sides of the same coin and are features of a society with very needy people, a society that is not socially cohesive. At the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, progress is a question of ethics. The year 2010 will be the year for combating poverty. We already know that the eradication of social exclusion and poverty will be a long and complex task, but if we make the most of each euro invested in this programme, if we are capable of reaching the groups of people that need most help, if we are capable of awakening the conscience of public opinion, we will be creating a new European citizenship. This is the big issue. Last week, the citizens of Ireland rejected the Treaty of Lisbon. Demagogic propaganda drawing on a wide range of opinions have wrought havoc in Irish society, provoking unfounded fears of globalisation and a certain amount of confusion about the construction of our common home. As well as making 2010 the year for combating poverty, we must also make it the year of European citizenship.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the main virtues of the work that has been done are the basic consensus on the diagnosis of the situation and the treatments that need to be applied at national level in order to achieve the employment objectives of the Lisbon Strategy. The Union needs to be extremely strong economically in order to make political progress without renouncing the social model that is in its genes. The best social policy is to allow people to integrate and make progress through employment. These eight guidelines give us the roadmap for the reforms that need to be tackled by 2010, and are more than sufficient for launching national reform programmes. However, there are some very decisive elements on which we need to work in a particular way. The first is achieving a level of mobility that opens up employment opportunities, essentially for young people. In order to do this, it is absolutely vital that we guarantee an effective system of equivalence of qualifications, not only in terms of degrees and diplomas, but in terms of training for employees throughout their working lives. The second is modernising the employment rules in order to move towards gradual and flexible retirement. This would avoid the decline in employment income and future situations of poverty. The third is to improve the linguistic competence of the population in general, because globalisation has its rules, ladies and gentlemen. Whoever adapts, wins. The rest lose. If we want greater productivity, quality jobs and greater skills, we need to continue to drive forward the reforms mentioned in the Lisbon Strategy. It is true that there have been achievements, but if the outstanding reforms are neglected, everything will collapse. That is why the implementation through dialogue of initiatives such as ‘flexicurity’ is essential.

Mr President, firstly I would also like to start by thanking the members of the Committee on Budgets for the support that they have given to the amendments that were put forward by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, that were also adopted practically unanimously by the committee. Firstly, with regard to budget Title 12, ‘Internal Market’, I would just like to say that what the committee aimed to do through our amendments was to recover the amounts in the PDB that had been envisaged by the Commission, which the Council document had subsequently reduced. I would like to mention or remind you of the importance that everything related to the internal market has in the European Union. I think that is obvious. It is one of the main bases for all the subsequent development that has been built around it. In some years, such as last year and next year, 2008, in which important legislation is to be adopted, for example the Services Directive, and also there are plans to continue moving towards legislation to perfect the internal market, we understand that it is necessary to recover the amounts envisaged in the PDB. The same argument could apply to Title 14, ‘Customs Union’, which also refers to perfecting the Union’s external borders, which, in turn, will enable us to ensure that our single market functions correctly. Finally, with regard to Title 17, relating to consumer protection, which concerns the committee for which I have been draftsman, I would like to say that, with the support of the Committee on Budgets, we have recovered the amounts in the PDB for the SOLVIT Programme. There are different levels of development of consumer policies and consumer protection policies in the various EU countries. On many occasions there are discrepancies that need to be resolved through non-legal, out-of-court instruments. SOLVIT has proved to be a good instrument for this. Finally, and I will conclude, Mr President, I would like to especially thank the Committee on Budgets for its support for a pilot project that has been allocated EUR 1 million, that will enable a study to be carried out in the next year monitoring and comparing the application of consumer policy measures in the various Member States.

 Mr President, first please allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Toubon, on the content of his report and for having the skill to kindle a broad base of support for its adoption in this plenary. A reaffirmation at this point that much progress has been made in the construction of a Single Market in the European Union is to state the obvious, yet nevertheless it is also important to reiterate, obvious though it may be, that there is still a long way to go. I believe that experience shows us that open economies are the economies which grow the most and that increased competition always translates into benefits for consumers in the quality and price of goods and services competing on or appearing in the market. In a globalised market such as the one in today’s world it is impossible to believe that progress can be made using protectionist measures, and of course the European Union, as an economic stakeholder at world level, will only be able to have a strong economy if it continues to pursue measures to liberalise, construct and deepen the Single Market. On many occasions people have depicted increased competition and the liberalising measures in the European market as a relinquishment of the European social model or as a relinquishment of the protection afforded by social rights. I believe the exact opposite is true, namely that for the European social model to continue to move forward, for European citizens to continue to enjoy social protection measures and good social services, it is important for the European economy to grow and that growth will only, I stress, be possible if we deepen the European Single Market. I said that a great deal of progress has been made but there is still some way to go, and one of my colleagues has just given some specific examples of this. I believe that it is important to remove barriers so that small and medium-sized undertakings can work throughout the European Union. It is also important, as stated in the report, to investigate and develop the market in retail financial services, and especially intellectual property rights. I would like to ask the Commission to call on national governments and on the Council to ensure that Community provisions are duly transposed into national legislation.

Madam President, I am speaking at this sitting in my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which approved the opinion by a large majority. Some of its content has been incorporated, either in spirit or more explicitly, into the report that Mr Hasse Ferreira has presented to us here this afternoon. I would like to explain some of the ideas included in the report by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and some of the characteristics of what are known as social services of general interest. All of these services unquestionably form part of what is known, broadly and in a manner that is difficult to define precisely, as the European social model, a model that they have helped to shape. Another aspect that everybody accepts is that these services must be fully subject to the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore for the States to define not just the field in which they are applied, but also the model and the system. There is another issue which I believe has been fully accepted, and that is that we are in a dynamic environment in which both the demands of society and, consequently, the incorporation of new social services, are constantly evolving and changing. Finally, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I would like to draw attention to the need also to make the provision of social services compatible with legal security and free competition. We must not forget that each State has different models for applying services. In the case of public services, social services must be guaranteed by public administrations, though it is not necessarily they who have to provide them directly. When private providers emerge, therefore, I believe that this Parliament and the Commission must be aware of the need, while respecting the specific characteristics of these social services of general interest — particularly in view of the jobs that they create — to guarantee the legal security of those service providers that wish to operate throughout the European Union.

Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating you on your election as Vice-President and on having obtained the highest number of votes in yesterday's election. We in this Parliament are once again discussing the case of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor sentenced to death in Libya. I would like firstly to express the solidarity of the whole of Parliament with the child patients – some of whom have now died – and with their families. At the same time, however, I would also like to make a strong statement in defence of our principles and against the death penalty. In the countries of Europe – thanks be to God – we reached the conclusion many years ago that no human being has the authority to take away the life of another nor to justify the possibility of that happening. In April 2005, the Members of the Delegation for Relations with the Maghreb Countries and the Arab Maghreb Union had the opportunity to go to Libya and talk about this case with the authorities. At that time there appeared to be a glimmer of hope because the plan – which was subsequently approved – for European Union cooperation with the children and the Bengazi hospital was in operation. Nevertheless, in view of the review of the trial and the new sentence, we have seen that the technical reports that have cleared the Bulgarian nurses of blame — some of them signed by the very person who discovered the AIDS virus and by Oxford scientists — have demonstrated, by means of a philogenetic analysis of the children's virus, that this virus had arrived in Libya many years before the Bulgarian nurses arrived on Libyan soil. In spite of that, we have seen that those reports have not been admitted in the court, and the nurses and the doctor have not therefore been given adequate judicial guarantees. I shall draw to a close, Madam President. Commissioner Barot asked us for discretion and prudence in relation to this issue. In fact, I believe that we have been acting in that way for eight long years now, and we can see how much we have achieved so far. Perhaps the European Union, as well as applying the principles of discretion and prudence, should now place the accent on firmness.

Mr President, Commissioner, there has been much talk this evening about the need to open up the services market in the European Union and also the need to remove obstacles to the achievement, or implementation, of some of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy. To this end, this services directive is not just a necessary instrument but also an essential one. What requirements should this directive, this text, have in order to fulfil the role we have set for it, however? In my view, firstly, it should set some clear criteria, which provide everybody with legal security, both consumers and entrepreneurs and, in particular, small and medium-sized businesses, which make up the majority — some 80 or 90% — of the European Union’s business fabric. And furthermore, this text - which should offer legal certainty and, I repeat, be clear - needs to be applied to all of the countries of the European Union. I must say that, in my opinion, the text approved in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection met these requirements. I have to say, however, that, at this point, I have my doubts as to whether the compromise texts that have been agreed meet the requirements of clarity and legal certainty. Finally, Mr President, I would like to make a brief observation. This evening, some people have tried to set two models for Europe against each other. Those who claim to defend the European social model — and who set themselves up as its only defenders — want to set their position against that of those of us who advocate the need for competition and competitiveness. I would like to say that the best kind of social policy is one that generates economic growth and creates jobs. I would like to say that the only possible danger to the European social model is a European Union without economic growth, clinging to old prejudices and incapable of competing with other economies, because, if we do not grow, it will be impossible to maintain our social policy.

 Mr President, Mr Cappato, your report is full of good intentions, the clearest proof of which is that no amendments were deemed to be necessary by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. You were the one who introduced 18 amendments to your own report. It is those amendments that have given the report a radical edge – to put it in general terms – and that have raised very serious doubts for me. I would divide into four distinct groups the amendments that you have proposed – amendments that you have proposed to yourself, I would stress – in a report that received the support of all groups initially. Firstly, some are impossible; you make some suggestions that are impossible. For example, Mr Cappato, some of your suggestions have no legal basis as yet: until the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, it will be impossible to harmonise the rules of the different institutions. Commissioner Wallström has just said something similar. You also call for 2009 to be declared European Year of Transparency, but we are too late, there is no time. Some of your suggestions are therefore impossible. Secondly, some of your suggestions are inadvisable. For example, you call for transparency in the meetings of the political groups. This would not do. There is a need for privacy, since privacy is a political asset. If I want to disagree with my party and to maintain my opposition, I want to do so in private: that is not a lack of transparency. There must be transparency within public bodies, but not within the parties, the privacy of whose debates must be guaranteed. I cannot, therefore, agree with you on this point. Some of your other assertions, Mr Cappato, are incorrect. For example, you state that 90% of legislative activity is done through comitology. This is a bold exaggeration, Mr Cappato. Furthermore, comitology has its own implicit transparency standards. If we introduce more mechanisms, more bureaucracy and more controls, we will be going against what we want to achieve: transparency, which is closely linked to simplicity. Lastly – before the President signals to me, because I am already nearing the end of my time – some of your suggestions are unnecessary. For example, I understand that it is really wonderful and attractive to public opinion to speak of transparency in Members’ activities, so that it can be seen whether they attend plenary sittings. It can already be seen, Mr Cappato. It can also be seen whether they attend the committees too; there are minutes for each of them, to which all citizens have access. The allowances that MEPs claim are also public. In other words, it is perfectly possible for citizens to gain access to this information. I therefore understand that it is wonderful in terms of public opinion and it looks good to defend transparency, but you must realise that transparency means ensuring that things are seen as they really are and that if we contribute to distorting how things are seen, Mr Cappato, we are not contributing to transparency. Thank you for your generosity, Mr President.

Mr President, as is customary, though this time it is well-deserved, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Belet, for his ability to hold dialogue with all of the groups and all of the Members. He himself reminded us at the beginning of this debate that we must not lose sight of the fact that this is a report on professional football, thereby adding a component that I believe to be crucial; I would also like to stress that we are dealing with an own-initiative report. That is to say that this is the first time that the European Parliament has focussed on football, sending out the message that it takes an interest in the phenomenon of football. That means that we must make our principal causes for concern very clear. When it comes to professional football, we must essentially discuss professional football clubs and spectators. Without those two elements, the problem that we wish to tackle would not exist. I therefore entirely agree with Mr Heaton-Harris’s final comment: there is no place for any speculation that does not take account of the crucial role of the actual football clubs. If we send spectators the message, ‘Look, the European Parliament wants to meddle in the world of football in order to make the spectacle of football less spectacular’; if we are going to say to the big clubs, the ones that have real customers, real social demand, ‘Look, for the sake of the principle of solidarity, your income is going to be restricted, you are not going to be able to sign up the big players and you are not going to be able to have those structures. We are going to make football less spectacular’, I can assure you, ladies and gentleman, that football fans – and there are many of us sitting here – will be astounded. They would say to us, ‘so you are concerned about football and you are sending out the message that you are going to make the spectacle less attractive by working against the big football clubs’. That is absurd. I would therefore ask, ladies and gentlemen, that we take that very much into account when it comes to dealing properly with the audiovisual rights of football clubs.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that democracy is a system of public opinion, and the freer the media is, the better the democracy. This directive regulates the media in the audiovisual sector and I believe that the question we should ask is: does it make it freer or less free than before? In order to respond to that question, we should consider this equation: the greater the interventionism of the authorities, the less free the media is, and vice versa: the less intervention there is from the authorities, the greater the freedom of the media. In my view, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is unfortunately excessively interventionist: with regard to advertising, with regard to quotas of audiovisual production, with regard to unnecessarily extending the scope to non-linear services, but above all, with regard to giving the national regulatory authorities power to protect the fundamental right of freedom of expression. All democrats know that protecting fundamental rights falls exclusively to courts of justice. This directive, however, and through no fault of the rapporteur, who has fought extremely bravely – and I thank you for that, Mrs Hieronymi – gives national regulatory authorities the power to decide what is accurate and what is not, what may be broadcast and what may not or, as has happened in Catalonia, one of the European regions with the poorest level of democracy in the whole of the European Union, which operators may broadcast and which may not. That is a way of opening ourselves up to prior censorship. I would ask you, please, Mrs Reding, to take this seriously, to see whether we can avoid it, amongst other things because we will have to listen carefully to what organisations such as Reporters Without Borders, the World Association of Newspapers or the World Press Freedom Committee have to say about this issue. They are going to embarrass us. I hope that that embarrassment will at least force us to correct our mistake in time.

Mr President, when Mrs Wallström presented the European Parliament with the White Paper on a European communication policy and I discovered that I was to have the honour of being rapporteur for the report on that White Paper, a journalist friend of mine, who works here in the European Parliament, told me that the best thing I could do was to produce a very short report containing just one paragraph saying ‘Mrs Wallström, the only use this White Paper has is as wrapping paper, because, although it expresses good intentions, it is useless’. I replied to my friend, ‘I think you are being unfair. I believe that Mrs Wallström is making an effort to create a good information and communication policy and furthermore, call me naïve, but on several occasions she has shown me that that is her objective. The problem is that the circumstances are not currently right for organising such an information and communication strategy in the European Union.’ Why is that? Because there is currently no legal basis for organising that information and communication strategy and therefore for establishing actions and controlling them properly. Let us therefore take a further step – and this is the approach I took when drawing up this report – and let us try to change the way things have been until now, because every time we meet to talk about the information and communication strategy, we make a load of general recommendations that come to nothing. Let us try to achieve what we do not yet have. Let us create that legal basis that will enable us to act much more effectively in the future. On looking into it, I discovered that there was only one formula for creating that legal basis: the application of Article 308 of the Treaty. When the circumstances in which that Article could be applied were explained to me, I was tempted to say, ‘it is impossible, we are not going to be able to do it’. There need to be three circumstances in place that are very difficult to bring together: firstly, the Commission must ask for it; secondly, Parliament must agree; and thirdly – and the most difficult circumstance to bring about – the Council must approve it unanimously. I spoke to Mrs Wallström and she told me that the Commission was in agreement. I spoke to all of the shadow rapporteurs, and they told me that Parliament could be in agreement. In the interinstitutional group we had the opportunity to hear the opinion of the Minister who, on that occasion, was representing the Council, and she told us that she was in a position, not to guarantee unanimity in the Council, since that is something she could not do, but at least to say that she believed there could be such unanimity. All the elements are therefore in place at the moment, but that will be very unlikely to happen again at a later date. In politics, the most important thing is to take advantage of the circumstances in place at a particular time. We currently have an opportunity that we will probably not have again in the future: a very good opportunity to improve things, to create a legal basis. That does not mean that it will cure all our ills, but it will clearly be a step forward. We have just two possibilities: either to accept it or to reject it. I propose that we accept it. Mrs Prets, Christa, I would ask you please to help me, because I know from Mr Corbett’s speech that your party is going to vote against the application of Article 308. Mr Corbett believes that there is another way to achieve that legal basis. There is not. Or if there is, tell me what it is. Let us negotiate. Let us talk about it. There has been no amendment from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs offering us an alternative. Gérard Onesta, shadow rapporteur for this report, whom I thank for speaking on behalf of the Group of the Greens/Euroopean Free Alliance, has understood that we have this opportunity and has agreed that we should take advantage of it. You know, Christa, that there was only one vote in the Committee on Culture and Education against this report, which calls for the application of Article 308. Let us try to take advantage of it. This is not an ideological issue. I have praised Mrs Wallström, who is not from my party, because I believe that she is doing the right thing. I would like to thank Mr Bono, because he has been shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in the Committee on Culture and Education. I know that you would help me if you could. I also know, however, that group discipline sometimes imposes views that are not the right ones. I would ask you to reflect between now and the vote, so that we can have this report adopted. I would earnestly beg you. This is not an ideological issue. It is a political issue. One of timing. It must be now or it will be extremely difficult in the future. This is the best way to organise the policy we want. Otherwise, members of the Committee on Culture and Education present here today, we will meet every year and hear a list of good intentions, which, as well as costing a lot of money, will be communicated by us to the Commissioner at the last moment, and we will have no control. We shall have little idea of how the money will be spent or of what use it will be. We will be going round and round in circles. Mr Bono, Mrs Prets, Mrs Badia I Cutchet, I can see you here, you are members of the Committee on Culture and Education: we discussed the report and approved it in that committee, with just one vote against. Mr Corbett’s amendment did not succeed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. We have not been provided with any alternative. Let us respond to the political opportunity we are being offered. I would earnestly beg you.

Mr President, Mrs Reding, historically, every time this directive has been discussed in the European Parliament, since 1984, there has been a struggle between Parliament and the Commission. Parliament has asked that the issue of pluralism be dealt with within the scope of this directive and on numerous occasions the Commission has said: this is a very delicate matter and we dare not — to put it in a simplified fashion — deal with it. In relation to this directive, in the preparations for the discussion we are going to hold from now on in Liverpool, an issues paper was entirely dedicated to the issue of pluralism, an issue that causes great concern. The Commission’s view has always been, ‘look, when industry is liberalised, pluralism will follow automatically’. But that is not true. It is not true because in the world of radio and the world of television we are subject to a system of administrative franchises and there is interference by public powers. Mrs Reding, I am going to tell you about something that is happening in our country and which has no precedent in the European Union: 500 000 Spanish citizens, more than half a million Spanish citizens — something which has never before happened in the European Union, in any of its institutions — are supporting an initiative to prevent a public power, the Government of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, from closing a radio station. Surely that is important and is of interest to the public. In view of this precedent, I would ask you: Mrs Reding, is the issue of pluralism going to be dealt with in this directive?

Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Weber for his willingness to engage in dialogue and for seeking agreement. I firmly believe that democracy is essentially a system of public opinion and that its quality therefore depends on the quality of what we have come to call freedom of expression, a right that not everybody understands properly. For me, freedom of expression is above all the right of each citizen to choose the channels of information he or she prefers. Consequently, in order to safeguard that right we must prevent too many media organisations from falling into the hands of a few, and I entirely agree with you, Mr Weber, on the need to combat the phenomena of concentration, but we must also consolidate a situation in which the media are not subjected to criteria laid down on a whim by the government that happens to be in power at the time. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe these comments to be very general, and they lead to certain specific considerations which I would like to be implemented in the not too distant future. We must combat all initiatives that reduce the quality of freedom of expression. It is therefore not acceptable to interfere with the content of programmes. Let us stop doing so. I do not believe that we should dictate to the commercial television channels how to administer their advertising, because advertising is essential to commercial television. They must respect the limit established by law, but we should not lay down how they must distribute advertising, because they know exactly how to make the source of their commercial survival viable. Mr Weber, we must establish the political objective — and this is where we disagree — of putting an end to a concept that I believe to pose certain difficulties: that of public service. That concept makes sense insofar as spectral space is limited and the governments must therefore regulate it by means of a system of franchises, which in the end become intimidatory. Nevertheless, Mr Weber, you have acknowledged that we are moving towards a world in which television must be redefined, a world in which television means conventional television as we know it, but also television via the Internet, television via mobile phone and television via all the new technologies. It is not therefore a scarce resource, and we must restrict State interventionism. I hope that in the not too distant future, this concept of public service will no longer be applied to commercial television. I would therefore like us to be able to agree on how to redefine the role of public television channels. They are fundamental, provided they adhere to the principle of subsidiarity, that is to say, that they make the programmes the viewers wish to see and cannot see on the commercial channels. Mr Weber, that is the principle of subsidiarity, which I defend. In conclusion, Mr President, I believe technologies are changing and that consequently the perspectives are changing too. I also believe it is our responsibility to do our utmost to ensure the new ‘Television without frontiers’ Directive becomes an opportunity to increase the quality of democracy. I would therefore like to express my hope that we do a good job.

Thank you, Mr President. Please believe me, Mrs De Sarnez, when I say that your report is really very good. We should guard against complacency, however, and always aim high, so I would venture to point out three issues in relation to which I believe we could have gone a little further. The content of the report deals with subjects that differ so much from each other that it is difficult to find a common denominator. It refers to the protection of minors on the Internet but also to the right of reply and discrimination. I believe, and I am addressing this to you, Mrs Reding, that we should make it possible for each of these issues to be the subject of a specific recommendation. Secondly, an express reference is required to the necessary respect for freedom of expression, because the protection of minors that we have laid out in this recommendation could lead to situations in which the restrictions extend to adults, and that would be a violation of Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In this regard I agree with what Mr Sifunakis has said. The United States Supreme Court rejected the Communications Decency Act for a similar reason and because no right is without limits. I do not believe that we should make the same mistake and we should be cautious. Thirdly and finally, I would like to point out that I believe the scope of this recommendation has been unnecessarily restricted, because we have talked a lot about minors as viewers of unwanted audiovisual content, but we have not focussed on minors as passive subjects. When we refer to paedophilia, we forget that it is children, minors, who are the object of this type of illicit information and I believe this report should make some reference to that point.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are going to vote on in a few minutes time covers, or attempts to cover, two fundamental objectives: firstly, to evaluate the application of the European institutions’ information and communications strategy, in other words, to look back and see what we have not done properly; and secondly, to propose certain effective ideas that contribute to making the information and communication policy better, in other words, to look ahead and see how we can improve that policy. I would like to thank all the political groups, in particular the shadow rapporteurs — María Badía, Giulietto Chiesa, Helga Trüpel and Manuel Portas — for the efforts they have made to enrich the report, something they have undoubtedly achieved, and to reach a broad agreement that allows us to vote on a text which hinges on five basic agreements. We basically agree that we have to ensure that information reaches every citizen, that they receive it via the most modern instruments, that is to say, television, radio, the Internet and the new technologies. It is not sufficient for us to prepare responses aimed at a few citizens who are already aware of being European and who already know what they need to ask. We must ensure that awareness of Europe, of what it means to be European, reaches everybody, and that sooner or later, everybody feels the need to ask what the European Union can do for each of them. We basically agree that, in order to do this, we must ensure that the messages of the European institutions reach the right audiences. We must ensure that these messages awaken the interest of the citizens, each and every one of them, according to their respective concerns, because it makes no sense to spend a lot of money providing generalised information that is ultimately of hardly any use to anybody. Every household must receive the message that is relevant to that particular household. And to that end, information must be decentralised, it must be channelled by means of local and regional media, with the help of good professionals, genuine professionals who are able to give the media the kind of assistance they really need. We basically agree that the citizens’ legitimate aspirations to participate actively in the development of the European Union will only be met if we are able to touch the emotions of the citizens. The European Union is no longer an ordinary international organisation with purely financial aims. It is a community of values. Those values are the very soul of the European Union. We must make it visible and we must make it attractive. We basically agree that we can do little from here without the cooperation of the Member States and the national parliaments. And we basically agree that it would be a mistake not to ensure that interinstitutional cooperation functions properly. This final point, that of cooperation amongst the different European institutions, has so far led to a very fluid dialogue during the production of this report, an unusually fluid dialogue, I would say, with the European Commission, and we all want this to continue. But it is not enough to want it. Desires are not enough. Only facts matter. It is a fact that, through this report, the European Parliament has tried to bring itself into line with the Commission as far as possible. And the Commission now has two options: either to incorporate Parliament’s contributions into the new communication about to be issued, or to do without them. If you chose the first option, we will move forward; if you chose the second, we will take an enormous step backwards. The ball is in your court, therefore, Mrs Wallström, but since I am sure that you want to do the right thing, and since I can testify to your willingness to hold dialogue and to reach agreement, I am also sure that you will be able to take this opportunity for the Parliament and Commission to work together in this fascinating task of communicating Europe. Amen.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the answer to the question 'is it possible to create six million new jobs in Europe by 2010?', is yes. In response to the question of whether this is an overly-ambitious objective, the answer is no. As to whether we are capable of achieving that aim, the answer depends on what we do and do not do. What must we not do? We cannot follow the example of those countries which have abandoned structural reforms and increased public spending. We need to do the very opposite: to increase growth. On this subject, I would like to use the example of the Aznar Government's policy in Spain – which can hardly be accused of inefficiency – to propose four practical measures. Firstly, let us make the labour market more flexible in order to increase labour force participation. Secondly, we need to ensure that the cohesion budget for the 2007-2013 period is sufficient for requirements. Thirdly, we need to encourage entrepreneurship by reducing fiscal and administrative burdens. Fourthly, we need to support measures designed to improve education and life-long learning. We also need to complete the single market, making the liberalisation of the communications, energy and financial services markets a priority. Then we need to open up the European economy to the outside world, focusing in particular on NICs. However, none of this will be possible, ladies and gentlemen, unless we have adequate budgetary resources – the figure of 1.24% of gross Community income set by the Commission is fine – and unless we involve the Member States directly in the process, since they are the main stakeholders in the Lisbon Strategy. If any of these States uses the Lisbon Strategy to propose cuts to Community policies that have been effective growth generators or in order to relax the Stability Pact, ladies and gentlemen, I bet you all a slice of Spanish tortilla
 and a Belgian beer that we will be on the road to disaster.

Mr President, Spain treated the referendum on the European Constitution with disdain, with the lowest turnout in our history. This has been the case partly because there has not been a sufficiently pluralist debate in the media. If we want passion, we need controversy. And the future does not look promising. The government of my country is promoting a law which will allow a friend of the Socialists, Jesús de Polanco, to control half of all radio in Spain. Furthermore, this gentleman already has a monopoly of satellite television and now he is seeking a further slice of the analogue advertising cake. Ladies and gentlemen of the left, Polanco makes Berlusconi look like a pauper. If we do not defend plurality in the media, we will very soon find ourselves in a situation in which the European Union’s information strategy is no longer debated in this Parliament: it will be decided on by four men in an expensive restaurant, with the capacity to impose uniform thinking on 450 million Europeans.

Thank you for your reply, Mrs Reding. Thank you for clarifying so precisely what we already know to be laid down in Community legislation. The purpose of my question, Commissioner, was to try to go a little further. In all the countries of the European Union, we often note that, in accordance with that interpretation of our rules, which you have clarified so well, there is often – shall we say – perverse behaviour that transgresses free competition. Do you believe that we could seek to produce a new formulation, a new text, which is able to bring together the public service criteria in a clearer manner?

Mr President, on 4 and 5 November, as we all know, on considering how to communicate Europe to the citizen, the European Council made a very lucid analysis of the situation facing us. Europe still lacks its own personality; it does not have a face of its own; knowledge of Europe reaches the citizens with difficulty and it therefore has a long way to go in terms of selling the idea of European political union. The Council was naturally extremely concerned, given the very imminent challenges we are facing, including the ratification of the European Constitution by each of the Member States. And it made a very specific recommendation, taking a practical approach that I would like to praise, which is to promote television debates in each of the countries in order to stimulate interest in this process of ratifying the Constitution amongst the citizens. I would like to draw the attention of the honourable Members to a problem facing us: the first country to have called a referendum on the ratification of the European Constitution is Spain. Spain is governed by the Socialist Party, which is the Party of the President of this House, Mr Borrell, as we all know, since he does nothing to hide it. Although, given his role as arbitrator, he should take care to keep his ideological positions rather more hidden. We are facing a dilemma: this Parliament, which should occupy a vigilant position, can either promote party positions or promote institutional positions. From that point of view, Mr President, I would like to call on everybody to bear this in mind, and not to abandon that vigilant position, and we should make it very clear that this European institution must also put aside sectarian or party political behaviour and think of the common project we have before us.

 Mr President, I am delighted to express my approval of this report and to thank the rapporteur, Mr Manders, and my colleague, Mr Harbour, for their excellent work, as also the shadow rapporteurs. This has been an excellent piece of teamwork. This package of measures is the result of significant efforts made by both the Commission and also Parliament and the Council. The Spanish delegation always argues for understanding, clarity and legal certainty which, together with full harmonisation, guarantee optimum consumer protection. We wanted clear rules and better market regulation for two reasons: firstly, for businesspeople, so that they can carry out their activities with a high level of quality and security, and, secondly, for consumers, so that they can feel confident when accessing this market, so that they have the necessary information before signing any contracts as well as the necessary safeguards protecting their rights. Good regulation stimulates market activity and benefits both consumers and businesspeople. That is what we wanted and what we have managed to achieve with this agreement.

 Madam President, allow me, first of all, to thank Enrique Barón for his career in Europe and all he has done for this Parliament. We will miss him a great deal. Madam President, on 9 May we celebrate ‘Europe Day’ in all our countries, but the truth is that we should sometimes hold a ‘No Europe Day’ to see what Europe would be like if the European Union did not exist. However, I think there has been a certain election fever today in Parliament, and it seems to me that much of the criticism we have heard here, especially about the European Commission, is entirely unjustified. I think the Commission has reacted well to the crisis and I wonder what would have happened had we not reacted. I would also remind one dear colleague and friend, who is not actually listening to me, of a compatriot of hers, André Gide, who said that everything exaggerated lacks value, and I think we need to set things straight. Madam President, allow me to add to what Chairman Leinen said. I believe it is very important that, throughout this process of electing the President of the Commission, we remember the spirit of Lisbon. I am sure that Mr Vondra and his successor will do so, because it seems to me that it makes no political sense to hold European Parliament elections and not take the result of those elections into account, nor consult the parliamentary political groups before presenting a candidate to the Chamber. This is something that must be said with total clarity to the Council: ‘Do not make the mistake of going against what this Parliament is going to adopt by a very large majority in Mr Dehaene’s report’. Finally, Mr Vondra, I would like to congratulate you on your Presidency. Ultimately, a distinction must be made between what is accidental and what is necessary and important, and I think you have done a good job. Many years ago, I learned from Milan Kundera and others that the Czech Republic was an important part of Europe; you have demonstrated that and I thank you for it. You have had some difficult times but ultimately, Mr Vondra, I like to think that tomorrow is going to be a great day in the Czech Senate and (‘Are we never to say how we feel?’, as a classic writer said) I feel and will feel great pride when the Czech Republic ratifies the Treaty of Lisbon tomorrow. Thank you, Madam President, and may it be so, as we say in my country.

Mr President, I would also like to join in the cries of ‘good news!’ voiced by Mr Yañez-Barnuevo García because I believe that this report marks a turning-point in relations with the United States. A good friend said to me recently that she had been in the United States and she had been surprised by the lack of knowledge regarding the new institutions and the new procedures created by the Treaty of Lisbon. If I had to praise something, to give a very positive assessment to one thing in the excellent report produced by Mr Millán Mon, it is precisely this: that it places transatlantic relations within the orbit of the Treaty of Lisbon for us and sets out all the major mechanisms provided by the Treaty of Lisbon so that the European Union can maintain relations on first-name terms with the United States. It grants us, as Europeans, the tools we need to be able to articulate this European wish, which was so necessary in the past, continues to be so today and will doubtless be so in the future. I would like to give my congratulations too to Mr Millán Mon on the excellent report that he has produced.

 A poem is never finished, only abandoned, said a Mediterranean poet born in Sète. I believe that something similar happened to the Barcelona Process: it was not finished, but it was abandoned – in part at least. That is why Parliament believes that the efforts made under the French Presidency to breathe new life into the Barcelona Process are important. That is also why, in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, we have actively collaborated on the report by Mrs Napoletano, whom I wish to thank for her patience and understanding. Why was the Committee on Constitutional Affairs concerned with this subject, Mr President? For several reasons. First, to guarantee the continuity of the Barcelona Process with the Union for the Mediterranean. Second, to avoid duplicating structures and embed this process into the institutional framework of the Union. Third, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has already said, to say that it is not simply an intergovernmental process but to emphasise the parliamentary dimension. That is why, in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, we have been insistent on issues already raised by President Pöttering on 13 July 2008. These refer to how the Parliamentary Assembly must meet once a year, be organised into groups on the basis of political families and produce consultative reports. We also tried to help the Council with the important decisions that it had to make. Mr Vondra, this House wishes to cooperate with the Council and we laid down the criteria that the headquarters of this new Union for the Mediterranean needed to meet. Coincidentally, these criteria coincided with a city in a country that I know very well; in fact, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs decided that Barcelona could be a good headquarters. Moreover, the ministers recognised it shortly afterwards, which, Mr President, reflects once again this desire to cooperate with the Council. I began by quoting Paul Valéry; permit me to finish by citing a verse by Paul Valéry as well: ‘Tu n’as que moi pour contenir tes craintes!
’. I believe that to soothe the fears that there could be on both shores of the Mediterranean, there could be nothing better than the success of this Union for the Mediterranean. Let us hope so, Mr President, and thanks, once again, to Mrs Napoletano for your understanding and help.

 Mr President, I would like to mention a compatriot of yours, who, during the French Revolution, was upbraided in the street by a sans-culotte, who said: ‘Why are you not carrying the Tricolore
, the symbol of the revolution?’. That compatriot of yours replied that there was no need to show on the outside what one felt in his heart. I am more one of those who, no doubt out of modesty, like a good Spaniard, do not externalise their feelings. However, this does not mean that I do not feel moved when I see the European flag hanging from Ljubljana Town Hall or when, at a meeting with our colleague Pierre Lequiller in Yvelines, I heard the European anthem follow the Marseillaise
, or when, yesterday, I read in a newspaper that the winner of the Prince of Asturias Prize, the Bulgarian Tzvetan Todorov, had said that ‘united in diversity’ was what European meant today. That is our motto. I am not one of those with a narrow, restrictive mentality or a beleaguered outlook on life, who think that the European flag is in competition with the national flag or that the European anthem aims to replace their national anthem. That, Mr President, is simply ridiculous. Symbols show that we belong to a community; they do not, in any way, represent an attempt to eradicate our individual native countries. They indicate added value, that we share something with other Europeans. I therefore believe that the initiative taken by Mr Carnero, whom I congratulate, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, is the right one. It is an initiative that, at a time when we are ‘stitching together the two Europes’, to use the wonderful expression of our dearly remembered colleague Bronisław Geremek, shows our fellow Europeans that we have the same values. These values are also expressed outwardly, including, but not exclusively, through symbols. The Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats will therefore vote in favour of this proposal to amend the Rules of Procedure, and I look forward to feeling moved, like everybody else, when I next hear the ‘Ode to Joy’ in this Chamber.

Mr President, I would like to put the following question to those who have said that symbols and anthems belong to the State. The city in which I live has a flag – the flag of Madrid – and the community in which I live – the Community of Madrid – has its own flag and anthem. Is it because they are states? Do they harbour ambitions to become a state? Do those who say that flags and anthems are national symbols wish to abolish local and regional flags? I would like an answer from my fellow Members.

 Normally, when the opposing parliamentary group comes to the aid of the rapporteur, who is from another group, the rapporteur should be concerned. This is the night of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Four members of the PPE-DE Group speaking in the debate on the Botopoulos report! What is most surprising, Mr President, is that we are here to applaud the proposal made by Mr Botopoulos, because we think that it is a good proposal, a consensus proposal, a proposal which, I can announce, will have the approval and political support of my Group. Parliamentary life is an expression of life in general, it is a life that changes, a life that we need to react to. Therefore, in response to an interpretation of the Rules of Procedure as to whether a specific article included the possibility of Parliament making observations in proceedings, Mr Botopoulos has clarified the issue by making a positive proposal, which is what life requires. Therefore, Mr President, my congratulations to this young MEP, for whom I predict great success in Parliament, and the support of my group, Mr President, for this reform.

 Mr President, this debate tonight is interesting, because I have listened to the rapporteur saying his report was inspired by Mr Bonde who, like Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, El Cid Campeador
, won battles after his death. Then along came Mrs Dahl, who has replaced Mr Bonde, and compared the rapporteur with Kafka, which is certainly a favourable comparison; that is to say, Mrs Dahl should not be so much in agreement with Mr Bonde. Then Mr Batten confessed to us that the parliamentary group’s money has been used to interfere in national referendums. I imagine that the Quaestors will have something to say about that, Mr Batten, because it is forbidden to use that money for such things. What about Mr Voggenhuber? What can I say about Mr Voggenhuber, who is from the country that so marvellously organised Euro 2008, which we Spaniards are so pleased about? Mr Voggenhuber has accused us of manipulation and criticised the compromise amendment, and it turns out that he signed it. In short, Mr President, in the interests of consistency, and being in agreement with what Mr Szájer, Mr Kirkhope, Mrs Esteves and Mr Rübig said, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is going to vote in favour.

 Mr President, the rapporteur does not need anyone to defend him; I have no doubt that he can defend himself, but I must say that I asked for the floor because I think that some of the speeches were excessive. I think that in this House we need to have debates and set forth arguments. I have just listened to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s speech, and we always disagree on this, but I think that some of the descriptions, insults and caricatures ultimately damage this institution, and especially those responsible for them, Mr President. Given that we are in France, I think it was a French writer who said that anything that is excessive lacks value. Today there have been some speeches that have lacked value. We appreciate what Mr Corbett has done, which is simply to reflect what is done by a group of Vice-Presidents of this House, in which all the groups in Parliament are represented. This is reflected in the Regulation, we have debated with him and we greatly appreciate the work that he does.

 (ES) Mr President, there has been talk here today of respect and there is no doubt that we have to respect the result of the referendum held in Ireland, in which some people voted ‘yes’ and some people voted ‘no’. I think we all agree that we must respect the remaining countries and, therefore, continue with ratification. However, I want to talk about respect for democracy and I want to state clearly that approval by the people has the same value as parliamentary approval; exactly the same value. We must remember the first ‘r’: respect. The second ‘r’ is reflection. We have to look at the reasons that led to the ‘no’ vote in Ireland, we have to endeavour to explain why the Lisbon Treaty is better than the current Treaties and we have to do so with facts and figures. We have to explain to the people that – like the Irish horse that won the Epsom Derby a few days ago, called New Approach
 – the Lisbon Treaty is also a ‘new approach’, which Europe needs to offer added value to its people. After that reflection, the third ‘r’ is resolution. We must find a solution, and in that respect let me completely clear: some of the ‘no’ supporters used a lethal and shameful argument. They said: ‘vote “no” and then we will renegotiate the Lisbon Treaty with advantages for Ireland’. I want to state clearly here that Europe is a community of rights, where the mood of society reigns and decisions must be respected. We in the European Parliament are stating clearly that there will be no renegotiation of the Lisbon Treaty: Europeans and this Parliament believe that that point is essential for Europe to move forward. Those of us who are in favour of the Treaty want to build on what we have. My question is: what alternative is put forward by those who want a ‘no’ vote? I would like them to explain it to me.

 Mr President, some of my fellow Members here are going to say: what is happening today? Have we lost all sense? A Committee on Constitutional Affairs item at ten to eleven at night? What has happened, then? Did Mr Duff strike a blow and relegate Mr Watson to the second row of the Liberal Group? What did we do here in the People’s Party? No, all we did here was comply with the recommendation of the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform, which says that, when there are only a few of us, we should try to meet together, if only to keep warm and not feel alone. Seriously though, Mr President, I believe that the meeting tonight deals with an important topic. I am very pleased that the Ombudsman is here with us. This is because, as Mrs Wallström, Vice-President of the Commission, so rightly said, after a decade of operation, it is normal and right to stand back and look at what is not working and what could be improved. This is precisely what the report of Mrs Jäätteenmäki aims to do and I would like to thank her for working so well with us all, and for seeking a consensus which demonstrates that, here in the European institutions, we live in a consensual and not a conflictual democracy. So, congratulations, Mrs Jäätteenmäki. What we have tried to achieve, Mr President, is something very simple. When the position of Ombudsman was created by the Treaty of Maastricht, we were at an important crossroads between a basically economic Union and an encouragingly political Union. The Ombudsman was a key element in that transition. Today we want to continue to support the Ombudsman in his work so that he can continue to be a vital player in this rapprochement
 between the institutions and European citizens. I am therefore convinced that the reforms proposed – by consensus, I would repeat – by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will go in that direction. At the next mini-plenary session we will debate the report of Mr Stubbs, who is dealing with another important aspect, transparency in the European institutions. Both reports are leading in the same direction, Mr President, and show that here, even at five to eleven at night, we are concerning ourselves with our citizens.
 Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur. − (ES) 
Mr President, I would also like to join you in congratulating Richard Corbett. I think that this collaboration between Richard Corbett and a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats shows what Europe ultimately is: that, even though we have different ideas and sensitivities, we are capable of doing things together; we are capable of making progress to improve the life of Europeans. I would therefore like to thank Richard Corbett for his collaboration and cooperation, which has always been loyal, and has always, I would like to stress, been aimed at doing things together, building, not at being negative or destroying. Mr President, three years ago Richard Corbett and I presented the Constitutional Treaty to this House, and we are now European Parliament rapporteurs on the Lisbon Treaty. It is clear, Mr President, that some of us were more ambitious than this Lisbon Treaty, and I think that this House was more ambitious. It is also clear that this is a unique situation. The ratification process had not proceeded, so a political solution had to be found, and the Lisbon Treaty is a political solution. Once again, this is Europe: it is seeking agreements, seeking commitments in order to find a way out of crises and get out of sticky situations. Mr Corbett has given a very good explanation, and I therefore echo his words concerning the advantages of the Lisbon Treaty over the Treaties currently in force. I would like to add one thing that Richard Corbett did not say: the Lisbon Treaty is not the Constitutional Treaty. We had to leave many of our ambitions by the wayside, which I regret, but I also think that the essential elements of the Constitutional Treaty are in the Lisbon Treaty. Although it is not the same, we have managed to retain the essential elements. What are the essential elements, then? What do we gauge as essential? The essential elements are those that will enable the European Union to be more democratic, those that will enable the European Union to be more efficient, those, in short, that will enable the European Union to provide added value for citizens. Mr President, this is the only thing that should motivate the European Parliament. We are the representatives of the European people and they should be the point of reference for our actions. We are living in a very important time for Europe. We saw this yesterday, with the situation in Kosovo. Europe must provide an outlet for the expectations that the European people have placed on us. Europe cannot adopt a head-in-the-sand policy. Europe needs to have a voice in the world, it needs to have a presence, and it needs to resolve the problems that exist now, whether that means climate change, combating illegal immigration or combating nuclear proliferation. We need to tackle these problems. The Lisbon Treaty, and this is a key question, ladies and gentlemen, gives us the tools and power to do this; obviously there will then have to be the political will to do this, but in this Treaty we have the tools to improve the current situation. Allow me to say something about building, about doing things together. As I said before, this is Europe. Supporting the Lisbon Treaty means doing things together, following the same path. It is true, as I said before, that we have abandoned some things. Paul Valéry, who was a great poet, and therefore perhaps also a great European, said that a poem is never finished, only abandoned. It is true that we have abandoned some things, but it is also true that, in the future, if we need to recover them, the European Parliament will be in the vanguard. (Applause)
 Íñigo Méndez de Vigo,  
rapporteur. − (ES) 
Mr President, today reference has been made to European integration from a historical point of view. The European Union that we have built in the last 50 years is the Europe of debate and dialogue, the Europe of respect for others, the Europe of putting ourselves in the shoes of others in order to understand them. This idea has been highlighted by the vast majority of this House in the debate that we have had today. However, in the debate there was also another Europe, Mr President, which I call the Europe of the three ‘c’s: the Europe of conflict, condemnation and contempt. As democrats we do not like this Europe, because we believe that there can and should be debate and dialogue but there should not be any condemnation. I think, Mr President, that many things have been said here today, some of which are entirely false. I am going to mention one in particular: when it is said that this Lisbon Treaty incorporates new doses of qualified majority, that is true, but what is not said is that the Lisbon Treaty means greater participation by the European Parliament. How can someone be a Member of this House and not want it to have greater participation in the political decisions that affect the European people? (Applause)
 I will conclude, Mr President, by quoting Miguel de Cervantes who, when old and at the end of his life, said that there were occasions when we had to decide whether to be a road or an inn. Being an inn is staying where you are. Being a road is moving forwards. I hope, Mr President, that, as my political group is going to do, and as the majority of the political groups in this House are going to do, we will vote in favour of the Lisbon Treaty with our hearts and minds. Let us use the democratic vote to give democratic recognition to those of us who want more Europe for all Europeans. (Applause)

 Mr President, the establishment of a multiannual framework for the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency is an extraordinarily important matter for those of us who believe that basic rights are part of Europeans’ DNA. Therefore I should like to join with the rapporteur and other spadkers who have said ‘onward’ with the multiannual framework ‘onward’ with the Agency’s work. I also believe that this report, as Mrs Gál, whom I support as spokesperson for my group, has said, is a balanced report which strives to be productive without being over-ambitious. Realistic, that I believe is the expression the rapporteur used. As the report is realistic I would like to ask Commissioner Frattini, my good friend Franco Frattini, for a little more support. For the European Commission only to accept nine of the 18 amendments we have tabled seems to me to be a poor effort, and an effort, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, is what is required on a matter of such importance as this. I had the good fortune and honour to be President of Parliament’s delegation to the Convention which drew up the Charter and am also equally honoured to chair the ATD Fourth World Intergroup, and we have succeeded on one amendment, number 15: to include combating social exclusion and poverty among the Agency’s objectives. Why? Because anyone who is socially excluded, living in abject poverty, ultimately does not enjoy any basic rights and that is why we are of the view that it would be an important political signal to our fellow citizens for amendment 15 to be viewed more synmpathetically than it has been by you, Mr Vice-President of the Commission. Ultimately, we MEPs represent the people and the people are asking us to concern ourselves with the least well-off as well. Therefore, Commissioner, I hope this debate will help you understand the importance of moving from accepting nine amendments to accepting more, and to support the European Parliament’s position on this matter.

 Madam President, this morning my Group celebrated and commemorated the approval of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Today the members of my Group are wearing a badge which says ‘Yes to the Europe of values’. In this respect I agree with what previous speakers have said, particularly Madam Wallström, about the European Union not being just a market. The European Union is a political project, but one based on principles and values which unite all European people. As a result, Madam President, today is a good day, with a resolution that will allow us to celebrate and solemnly proclaim this Charter of Fundamental Rights during the next Strasbourg part-session. In fact, I will not be revealing any secrets by saying that those of us who had the good fortune to participate in the drafting of this Charter in the first Convention were left with a bitter aftertaste. This was for two reasons, the first being that, although we drafted the Charter as if it were to be legally binding, in the end this was not possible in Nice because six governments rejected this. However, time has proven us right and now the Charter, thanks to the Lisbon Treaty, will be legally binding. That bitter aftertaste has now been converted into satisfaction. The second reason, Madam President, is that I remember how in Nice there was no solemn proclamation of the Charter. A great opportunity was lost to explain to the European people that the rights and freedoms proclaimed in the Charter are our identifying marks, for it was signed in secret. However, thanks to the determination of the President of the European Parliament and our three representatives in this Intergovernmental Conference, on 12 December during the Strasbourg part-session we will achieve what they failed to achieve in Nice. We will solemnly proclaim this Charter and will reaffirm, as the members of the PPE-DE Group have done, our commitment to these rights and freedoms set out in this Charter. We will vote, Madam President, in favour of Mr Leinen’s report.
 Íñigo Méndez de Vigo  (PPE-DE

 Madam President, today the President of France spoke to the House about the need for dialogue and debate. I think that is what we all learnt during the period of reflection, as Vice-President Wallström said. For dialogue and debate, however, we need instruments, and some of the most important and indeed essential instruments – although not the only instruments – are political parties. European political parties, like national political parties, shape the will of a people. That must also be their role in the representative institutions in Europe. Talking about political parties at European level without talking about funding would be pointless. We must look at how those political parties, so necessary for shaping the people’s will, are funded. I think that the most important issue in relation to political parties at European level – and also at national level, but it is the European level that is of interest to us here – is that financing ought to be responsible, clear and transparent. That is what is important to the taxpayers: that their money is well spent and that there are institutions that take responsibility for the way in which their money is used. I believe that the people of Europe, although they may have some doubts or hesitations over the direction Europe ought to take, have no doubt that their future lies in Europe. Here in Parliament, I always hear even those who are most opposed to European ideas claiming that they are European and are not against Europe. To go back to what I was saying at the start, and quote Mr Sarkozy once again: debate is necessary, and for there to be debate we must create the instruments needed to organise it. I therefore welcome the report by Mr Leinen, which takes on board the Commission proposal, and I also thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my good friend Mr Lobo Antunes, for your proposal to us. The European People’s Party will not discuss the basis here. If the regulation needs to be divided in two to find a solution that is acceptable to all, then so be it. You can count on our support.

Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, the spokesperson for my Group, Mr Daul, said that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is satisfied, and this is because we have got out of an impasse, but we are not happy. This is due to the not very pro-European atmosphere among the governments, which contrasts with the polls that President Barroso referred to concerning the will of the European people, and also because the Lisbon Treaty ultimately includes many made-to-measure elements for governments that want more and more for themselves and less and less for Europe. President-in-Office of the Council, you referred – and I would like to congratulate you on the agreement that has been reached, because I would like to stress that I think that the agreement is important for getting us out of the impasse – you referred to three issues that I would like to highlight. Firstly, I think that it is very important to have a formal proclamation in this House of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This was not done in Nice, it was done in secret. Let us now do it formally, because the Charter of Fundamental Rights, with or without opt-outs, is the DNA of the European people. Secondly, Mr President, I am concerned about the distribution of seats in the European Parliament, because what you have adopted violates a principle that is in the Treaty, which is degressive proportionality. Is it going to come to Parliament? We will see what we do, but you are well aware that what you have adopted does not provide degressive proportionality. Finally, the High Representative. I think you have reached a good agreement, but I think that the President of the Council, the High Representative and the President of the Commission form a package, which we will have to discuss in Parliament. In summary, Mr President, I think that it was Paul Valéry, who was a great poet and, perhaps therefore a great European, who wrote that a poem is never finished, only abandoned. The construction of Europe never finishes. In this case we have, in the interests of consensus, abandoned some of the advances of the Constitutional Treaty, but we will be here to keep fighting for them. We will also have supported them in a sentence of the preamble which, ironically, was rescued from the flames: an ever closer union between the peoples of Europe. That is our objective, Mr President.

Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is pleased that the European Council should have reached an agreement, and in a few minutes time, therefore, my group is going to vote in favour of the resolution so that the Intergovernmental Conference can meet in accordance with Rule 48. The important thing now, however, is for this agreement, the agreement resulting from the Intergovernmental Conference, to be a good one. Let me make myself very clear. What we are saying is that the Conference should go ahead, but we will judge the Intergovernmental Conference on its results. I would also like to say that for my group, which will be represented by Mr Brok in that Intergovernmental Conference, it will be an important political issue to act as guardian of the Constitution. We want the content and the substance of the agreement of the European Council to be present in the final agreement on the Treaty resulting from the Intergovernmental Conference. One issue which has been mentioned by Mr Sócrates is that of the referendums. Let me tell you something, while nobody is listening: Do not trust parties that are in opposition and call for referendums. Do not trust those that call for referendums so that they can vote ‘no’ either, because they want to destroy Europe. Some want to destroy the government in office and others want to destroy Europe. I therefore believe that Mr Sócrates’ words this morning sum it up. No country can create a mess for all the other countries and at this point we must all aim in the same direction in order to get Europe out of its impasse. The first agreement by the European Council is an initial step and I now believe that we must all set about, on the one hand, reaching a good agreement and, on the other, beginning, once we have rid ourselves of that burden of the constitutional impasse, to work. Because what has really worried me, Mr President, is the climate of suspicion and distrust in Europe, which I saw at the last European Council. That is something that must be of concern to all of us and something we must all resist together. (Applause)

Mr President, the President-in-Office mentioned Baltasar Gracián in his speech and that reminded me that my compatriot used to say ‘if the good is brief’ then it is ‘twice as good’. I believe that one of our tasks in the European Council with regard to the Constitutional Treaty is, as Mrs Wallström has said, to produce an accessible, comprehensible and clear document. It is possible to do so. That has been demonstrated by the Action Committee for European Democracy, chaired by Giuliano Amato: 448 articles have been reduced to 71 articles, 67 000 words to 16 800. Brief therefore, but also good, as Gracián suggested. It is good because we are considering the content, and maintaining the essential content of the Constitutional Treaty. It is therefore possible to do so, Mr President. Judging from the tone of the speeches today in this Parliament, I believe that an enormous majority in this House – and the vote on the Barón/Brok report will demonstrate this – wants to maintain the essential content of the Constitutional Treaty. So please take the impetus provided by Parliament in that direction away with you today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. Our friend and colleague, Mr Schulz, has talked today about physicists and the importance of physics. Back in the days when I worked in a different field, Mr President, I remember performing Friedrich Dürrenmatt’s ‘The Physicists’, and I played Isaac Newton. In the final speech, Newton said that scientific progress cannot be stopped and that we must not be fearful of the progress made. I believe that we must not be fearful of the progress contained in the Constitutional Treaty either. (Applause)

Madam President, in a story by Hemingway — the Old Man and the Sea —
 the protagonist battles to bring a marlin back to port. It is a titanic battle. When he finally reaches port, however, the fish is no longer there, and only its bones remain. That, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is what this Parliament does not want to happen with the Constitutional Treaty. We applaud the German Presidency for wanting to reach an agreement, but we wish to tell it clearly that, though we want an agreement, we do not just want any kind of agreement. In the report drawn up by Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Brok, therefore, we state clearly what we believe to be the essential content of the Constitutional Treaty that that agreement must take up: we state it in paragraph 9. We also say that we must listen to everybody, but we must not just listen to those people who want less Europe (because there are some people who only want less Europe). Do not just listen to them. Listen also to those who want to improve the Constitutional Treaty. Because all we hear about are reductions, as if the spring sales had arrived in the big stores. It is possible for an Intergovernmental Conference to improve the Constitutional Treaty: for example, by incorporating issues that were not on the table five years ago, such as climate change, energy or solidarity with regard to energy, or defining the duties of the Anti-Terrorism Coordinator, a very important issue today, following ETA’s announcement that it will go back to killing. Those additions are possible, and we would urge you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to include them. As the President of Parliament said previously, what we want is to help you, and we want the European Parliament also to participate in this Intergovernmental Conference. We do not want to replace you, of course, but in paragraph 12 of the report we define the methods for this Parliament’s involvement. Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament will judge the result of the Intergovernmental Conference in terms of the Constitutional Treaty, and we say this in paragraph 11. We shall have no hesitation in rejecting any agreement reached by the Intergovernmental Conference should it not meet our expectations. (Applause)

There has been talk here, Mr President, of the importance of a European climate change policy. Is that possible with the current Treaties? No. There has also been talk of the social integration of immigrants. Is that possible with the current Treaties? No. And what about a single energy market? It has no legal basis in the current Treaties. I say this because to contrast what some have called ‘the real polices of concern to the citizens’ with instruments and techniques, as if the latter were not important, simply shows ignorance of how the European Union works. Without procedures, without legal bases, the European Union cannot act, and without more democracy, it will be acting without legitimacy. That is why it is so important that we reach an agreement on the Constitutional Treaty. I believe that, following the German Presidency’s success at the Berlin event, that is what we must now be working towards. I hope that the European Council in June will provide for that. It does not need to be done unanimously, and I believe that it is very important to set the mandate. And on setting the mandate for the Intergovernmental Conference ─ and a university teacher is speaking here ─ we must take account of those who have passed the exam, in some cases with distinction, and we must help those who have failed it and those who have not taken it, but we must not just take account of those who have failed or not taken it. Those of us who have ratified it, therefore, have fulfilled our commitment and we must be taken into account when that mandate is established. It has been said here, and quite rightly, that this Parliament, via yourself, Mr President, has made a decisive contribution to the Berlin Declaration. I believe that we want to do the same in the Intergovernmental Conference: we all want to help the European Council, because the Commission is part of the Intergovernmental Conference, because the national parliaments are going to ratify the result of that Conference. But we want to make a decisive contribution to ensuring that the Intergovernmental Conference is as great a success as the Berlin Declaration, at least.

Mr President, I am delighted to be able to take the floor today, on a very special day, when you are presiding over the House, and you are aware of the great admiration and brotherly friendship I feel towards you. I am also delighted to have heard the speech by Mrs Merkel, particularly the first part of it. I believe that a political leader is someone whose political action is guided by their vision, and today we have seen a lot of that vision, and that is necessary, Mrs Merkel, because in Europe today there are too many accountants, too many prophets of doom, too many people who complain about everything, and I believe that we need a little vision, founded upon values and principles, in order to restore our dream. I therefore congratulate you. I also congratulate you on having made the Constitutional Treaty the German Presidency’s priority from the outset. President Barroso has explained why the Constitutional Treaty is better than the existing Treaties very well. That is a reality that nobody denies. If we compare what we have to the Constitutional Treaty, the Constitutional Treaty comes out infinitely better. There is, however, also a psychological reason: many Europeans believe that Europe will be in crisis until the constitutional issue is resolved, and therefore, in order to put an end to this interminable crisis, we must find a response. I do not believe, Mrs Merkel, that this is the day to give us the key aspects of the response. That is not possible. We still have much talking to do. But you have said something. You have said: ‘I want the European Commission and the European Parliament to be consulted’. I would like to say to you that, in my view, consultation is not enough. The European Commission and the European Parliament must take part in the solution. They must participate because history shows that governments essentially put national interests first and the interests of everybody else second, and the Commission and Parliament, which are European institutions, institutions for everybody, have a more general vision. We therefore need ambition, Mrs Merkel, if only to comply with the words of Schiller, ‘den Mutigen hilft Gott
 [God helps the brave]’

Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate the two rapporteurs. Fortunately, the two rapporteurs are both from my political group, Mr President, and they have acted jointly and in a complementary fashion. They are not aware of this, but I am going to reveal a secret this morning: in my political group, Mr Swoboda, we call Mr Brok and Mr Stubb ‘the twins’. I hope that other twins that are better known across Europe will excuse our appropriating the name. The truth is, however, that they have done what other twins should do. They have acted jointly for the good of Europe. They have not absorbed the amendments of other political groups, but rather they have integrated them. I therefore believe that the House will vote today in favour of these two reports on the strategy for enlargement and the capacity to integrate. Mr President, these two reports make various positive commitments. The first commitment – as Mr Stubb has explained eloquently – is to enlargement. We believe that enlargement is enormously advantageous for the European Union and for the States that join it. There is no doubt about that. Anybody who doubts it should look at the Resolution’s paragraph 19. It is also clear, however, that in order for enlargement to be a success, the European Union must be prepared to accept those new States. The reality is that that is not currently the case. Nobody invites a guest home unless the house is prepared for them. Putting the house in order is the second commitment made in Mr Stubb's report: the commitment to the Constitutional Treaty. Not so long ago, two out of every three Members of this House supported the Corbett-Méndez de Vigo report. Mr Stubb’s report stresses that fact. We still believe that the content of the Constitutional Treaty is necessary in order to make it possible for our home to receive further guests. I believe that it is very important to stress that now, because the German Presidency is going to make proposals with a date, that of 2009, and I believe that paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Stubb report emphasise what must be the content of any future reform, and also reject something that we in this Parliament have also emphasised on occasions: we do not want cherry picking – the partial entry into force of certain aspects. We want the balance represented by the text of the Constitutional Treaty. Finally, Mr President, both reports have a clear political message. You will be at the European Council and I would ask that you repeat it there: there will be no further enlargements without a European Constitution. There will be none. This Parliament must issue a favourable opinion when it comes to approving any new enlargement. It will exercise that right, because that is what this report formally states. Mr President, my group will support both reports, and with regard to Mr Stubb’s report, it will vote in favour of Amendments 6, 7 and 8.

Mr President, Mr President of the European Commission, you have made a good speech today and I would like to congratulate you on it. You have made a good speech, because I believe that you have managed to move people, those of us who are here and those outside of this Parliament who are listening to us. You have argued that we should not allow ourselves to indulge in Euro-pessimism and I believe that you are right. You have also said something very important: that Europe is not in crisis. It is true. Europe is not in crisis. We must not allow ourselves to believe that. It is also the case, however, that we must make an effort to explain why the Constitutional Treaty is important to people’s lives, because many people take the view that the Constitutional Treaty has not entered into force – which is the case – but nothing has gone wrong as a result; Europe has not fallen into the sea. Many people are therefore tempted to say that the Constitutional Treaty is not so important, since nothing has gone wrong despite it not having entered into force. In all of the campaigns that I have taken part in, I have never heard what all of the leaders who have spoken here today have said: the Constitutional Treaty is necessary in order for Europe to function better, in order to provide the people with added value. We must make a huge educational effort to explain to the people what I have previously called ‘the cost of not having a Constitution’: why not having a Constitutional Treaty has a negative impact on their daily lives. As Mr Rasmussen has said, explaining these things is a tough task; it is a task that requires a great intellectual effort. We must apply our grey matter, in order to explain it to the people through clear and relevant examples, but it is a necessary task. I believe that Europe requires a huge amount of education today, but it also requires a degree of calm, a degree of political skill, and I believe that this Parliament, which has been a pioneer on many other occasions, through the Resolution by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that we are going to approve today, indicates that direction. Through a lot of education, I believe that we will be able to rescue the ship of the Constitution, get it back afloat, and ensure that the Constitutional Treaty provides the people with added value.

Mr President, the other day in my country, a great Europeanist – Fernando Álvarez de Miranda – told me that the Europeans’ problem is that they have lost their excitement about Europe. It is true: we are often Europeans without realising it, and we do not realise what great progress the Union has made; we do not give Europe the credit for it and instead we blame the Union for our little frustrations. We are now in this period of reflection, trying to demonstrate that Europe works. As you have said, offering an example, I often wonder whether we are doing the right thing. For example, we say that Europe must gain legitimacy by creating work; but does Europe – the European Union – have the instruments for creating employment, or are they national instruments? If we set objectives that do not depend on the Union, but on the Member States, and we do not achieve them, then the Union will pay the price. I am therefore going to propose to you, Mr Verhofstadt – and you can do this, because you are the Prime Minister of your country – that one day you carry out the following test, in order to demonstrate what life would be like for the citizens if Europe did not exist; you could, for example, on 29 May or 1 June, install border posts between your country and France and between your country and the Netherlands, and at those posts you could put customs officers who could ask the French or Dutch citizens for their passports and tell them that their French car insurance was not valid in Belgium and that they have to take out a green card. And on one day – just one day – you could re-establish the Belgian Franc, and the euro would not be legal tender in Belgium and would have to be exchanged; and, when French and Dutch citizens returned to their beautiful countries, Mr President, those customs offices could make them fill out a form indicating the goods that they have bought in your country. That would show them what the European Union is, Mr President. (Applause)

Mr President, Mrs Wallström, Vice-President of the Commission, my group supported the Commission’s Plan D because it believed, and still believes, that it is a good way of responding to the challenges facing Europe at the moment. We therefore encourage you to keep going. You said that we were going to move on to the second phase of Plan D; the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is going to make a proposal to you: we are no longer calling it a discussion, because a discussion that lasts for too long can give the impression that we are having a rest and not doing much more; let us call it an analysis, because I think that what follows an analysis is a proposal, which is what you are referring to with the joint declaration by the three institutions. I think that this joint declaration by the three institutions is a good idea, Mrs Wallström, firstly because it marks the symbolic anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, which were the starting point for the Community, but also because it means that the Council, the Commission and Parliament want to put forward proposals together for a way out of the situation of the Constitutional Treaty. You can therefore count on the European Parliament for this institutional declaration, but this means that we want to take part in drawing it up, not just sign it at the end. I think that the fact that the process of ratifying the Constitution continued in Estonia and that the Finnish Parliament decided to ratify it is good news, which proves that all those who are prophesying that the Constitution is dead are wrong. No one ratifies something that is dead. I think that the task that we have at the moment – and when I say task, I know that what I am asking is not simple – is to convince European citizens of what we could call ‘the cost of non Constitution’. Remember many years ago, when the Single European Act was being debated, there was a report called ‘The cost of non Europe’, in other words, what it would cost people if the Single European Act did not come into force and the internal common market was not created. I believe that what we need to do in this debate on the Constitutional Treaty is something similar: to explain to people, with examples, what would be lacking in their lives if there were no European Constitution. I am certain that this is a good task for the second phase of analysis, because it could produce proposals that will ultimately help to achieve what all of us, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, want: for Europe to add value for people, for Europe to defend our common values and for Europe, ultimately, to make people’s lives more effective, fairer, freer and better supported.
 Íñigo Méndez de Vigo (PPE-DE

 Mr President, I am a real person who is going to talk about real issues!  (ES)
 I address this to Mr Allister and Mr Bonde. The difference between the last speakers and the majority of this House is that what we – the majority of this House – want is to build, we want to do things together, we want Europe to move forward, because we believe that Europe provides a good solution to the people’s problems. In other words, we are not entrenched in defensive positions, we are not being critical and saying that everything is discriminatory. No: we simply want to bring together the enthusiasm of the different parties in this House, of the different political families in this House, in order to seek solutions to the people’s problems. That is the fundamental difference between us, Mr President; let us not deceive ourselves. In this regard, the political parties play a fundamental role: political parties that, in reality, have emerged from the parliamentary groups in this House, just as they originally did in the different national States as well. The origin of the political parties lies in the parliamentary groups in this House. I believe that, if the European political parties have one problem, it is that, in reality, they are still federations, associations, of national political parties. That is the reality. It is true that we have made progress over recent years, but not enough. We have to do much more. Why? Because I believe that the political parties at European level may be able to encourage the European debate and prevent any debate on European issues at national level being turned into a debate on domestic issues, which is what we see happening time and time again. I believe, for example, that if the European Council had heeded Parliament’s request that any referendums on the European Constitution be held on the same day, we would have been able to ensure that European issues were discussed rather than domestic issues. Looking towards the future, however, Mr President, I believe that, at a time when more and more of us are feeling the need for the provisions of the European Constitution, the European political parties, during this reflection phase — and I am delighted that Vice-President Wallström, who is responsible for these initiatives within the Commission, is here — have to play a very important role. On 8 and 9 May, we are going to hold the first Interparliamentary Forum here. I believe that the role of the European political parties is going to be key to uniting the synergies of the Members of the European Parliament and the members of national parliaments and to moving in the direction that the majority of us who believe that the European Constitution is necessary in order to move Europe forward want to see. We therefore have some great challenges here, and it is clear that these great challenges — Mr Onesta was right — at the end of the day require not just fine words, but they also need proper funding. I believe that this report by Mr Leinen, whom I would like expressly to congratulate, highlights the difficulties of the Regulation and the formulae we must use in order to overcome them more effectively. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, therefore, Mr President, is going to back Mr Leinen’s report and is also going to vote in favour of the amendments presented by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, by Mr Onesta on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance — which relates to young people’s associations — and by Mr Maaten and Mrs De Sarnez. I believe that this would demonstrate that what we want is to build, Mr President, in the face of those who merely want to destroy.
 Íñigo Méndez de Vigo (PPE-DE

(ES) 
Mr President, I hope that you will understand me because I am going to speak in an official language. I believe that languages are a vehicle for communication rather than for isolation. I believe, Mr President, that this report makes three important points. Mr Dehaene and Mr Stubb have already said some important things on this issue, but there are three points that I would like to mention. Firstly, this Constitution is the result of a consensus and, until we have an alternative menu, this is what we have. And it is a good consensus because those people who have voted ‘no’ in certain countries of the European Union are incapable of having a coffee together or of producing an alternative text. That is the reality. Those who say ‘no’ are people who reject but do not build. They are not proposing anything. Until there is another menu on the table, I shall stick to this menu and this Parliament will stick to this menu. Secondly, we are against the partial application of aspects of the Constitution. Why? For the same reason: because the Constitution is the result of a consensus and we are not all in agreement with all of it, but we agree with it as a whole and we would not therefore accept − and this Parliament is right to state this in its report − the idea of taking one thing but not another. We agree with everything as a whole but we do not agree with cherry-picking.
 Thirdly, this Parliament states in this report that there will not be any new enlargements of the European Union without a Constitution, and it has good reason. We are aware that the Union will not operate, either in democratic terms or in terms of efficiency, without the provisions laid down in the Constitution. This appears in Article 49 of the current Treaties, Mr President, and I address this to our ostrich friends, because this Parliament must give its opinion on any enlargement of the European Union and, through this report, this Parliament is making a very clear and solemn commitment: there will be no enlargements without a Constitution.
 Íñigo Méndez de Vigo (PPE-DE
). –  
(ES) 
Mr President, I shall speak out of parliamentary courtesy: firstly, because you are here and I believe we should be grateful for that and, secondly, because it was my group that requested that we hold this debate. In accordance with our Rules of Procedure, this debate need not have taken place because the vote in committee was overwhelmingly in favour of the report by Mr Onesta, but my group asked for it, precisely because my group likes transparency. I would like to say that I am delighted that we asked for it, despite the time, because I believe that it has been a model debate: the Members who have spoken before me have expressed perfectly what this reform of the Rules of Procedure means. Again out of parliamentary courtesy, and in view of the time, I shall say no more and we can all go home.
 Íñigo Méndez de Vigo (PPE-DE

Mr President, discouragement and determination are two words that begin with ‘d’ and which I believe accurately reflect the feelings of Mr Juncker today and of many Members of this House: discouragement in view of what happened at the European Summit, determination to face the future: discouragement, because Mr Juncker, on describing the debate on the financial perspectives to us, sounded like an auditor heading a team of accountants. And I would put the question: who was talking about Europe when the financial perspectives were being negotiated? Nobody talked about Europe. Everybody talked about their national interests. Actually that is not true, Mr President: some people talked about Europe, those we call the ‘new countries’ talked about Europe, the countries of the last enlargement. I believe that, if there has been an example of vision and ambition at this Summit –
 the vision and ambition that has always characterised Europeanism –
 then that example has been given by the new countries. I therefore propose that we stop calling them ‘new countries’, because they have shown that they do not need to take lessons in Europeanism from anybody. Like Mr Lamassoure, I too believe that we will certainly have to reflect upon the system of own resources. We tried that in the Convention — some of you will remember — but there was no way of introducing anything. In fact, there was a small group in the European Convention considering how to introduce a new system of own resources into the Constitution. We will have to return to this issue. With regard to the Constitution, Mr President, I believe that what is going to happen in practice, which is the suspension of the referenda, is a good thing: this is not the right time to hold more referenda and we must dedicate ourselves to debate. I therefore believe that the idea of establishing the end of the Austrian Presidency as the time for relaunching the process is a good one and I believe that this Parliament must begin to consider what it is going to do in the future. In this respect, the resolution that will be voted on tomorrow contains a clause that moves in that direction and I believe that it conforms to that ‘d’ for determination that Mr Juncker urged us to show and that I am sure this Parliament will agree with.

Mr President, I do not find it easy or pleasant to speak today. I have put a lot of thought into the position my group should take and the position this Parliament should take with regard to the ratification process. I believe that Europe has always made progress on the basis of consensus. I have observed today — as has been said — that, despite the fact that 10 Member States have ratified it, despite the fact that many Europeans have said yes to the Constitution, there is no consensus to move forward. I note that the text of the Constitution is not being debated, but rather the political context. I therefore believe that the worst thing we can do is not to look carefully at the reality and not to concentrate on what the people are asking for. The people are asking us to listen, to debate and to hold dialogue. I believe, today as I did yesterday — perhaps more firmly than yesterday — that the Constitution is necessary for Europe; and since I believe that it is necessary and that we must save it, the most logical thing — and this is the position of my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats — is that the ratification process be delayed. I believe that, if the Heads of State or Government take a unanimous decision in this regard, we will all have time — perhaps one year until the end of the Austrian Presidency — to consider what we should do about the Constitution, how we should explain these things to the people, how we should re-establish contact with them. It is at times like these, these difficult and unpleasant times, that the importance of people becomes clear, when we must not just do nothing and see what happens, but rather we should do what we believe to be most useful in order to implement something that we believe to be necessary. I believe that the Constitution is necessary. And since this is a difficult situation and a painful decision, my group, which has reflected carefully, believes that the best option is that of delay at this time.

Mr Barroso, congratulations on your previous speech and on having put things straight and put certain people in their place. I believe that Mr Leinen and Vice–
President Wallström have laid out the characteristics of this fourth Framework Agreement, and I am not therefore going to deal with the specific issues that they have explained so well. But please allow me to express a political consideration on behalf of my group. The history of this Parliament is the history of an assembly that wants more power, a consultative assembly, a Parliament elected by universal suffrage, then a Parliament with certain competences in the field of the internal market, a Parliament with codecision powers pursuant to the Maastricht Treaty and, since then, a Parliament which has been playing an increasingly significant role in legislation and political control, and that is extremely important. And I believe that, in compliance with the Treaties, this fourth Framework Agreement serves to move us forward in this direction. I would like to say that, while moving in that direction, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has always believed the Commission to be at the heart of the system, to be the most innovative element of the institutional architecture and that it is therefore also the most decisive element of that architecture. In the debates currently taking place, when we are asked why the European Parliament does not enjoy legislative initiative, we say ‘because it is the job of the Commission to define the Community interest, because it is the job of the Commission to ensure compliance with the Treaties’. I am therefore sure that this Framework Agreement is in line with the new European Constitution, which will provide more democracy, more efficiency and more transparency, and that it will achieve those objectives in that same way. And when we approve this Agreement tomorrow — and we will approve it tomorrow with the votes of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats — I would urge the European Commission to respond to the need to produce initiatives in Europe and to present them; if it does so, when it carries out its duties, it will always have the support of the Group that it is my honour to represent today. Thank you very much, congratulations on this work and please go ahead. It is now time to get to work.

Mr President, we have had to endure Mr Belder telling us what he thought, or rather what he did not think, about the Foreign Service. That is the masochism we have to suffer in this Parliament, and you, Mr President, are largely responsible for it. Having said that, however, I believe that this is a crucial issue and I am therefore delighted that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has taken this initiative. When we discussed this issue in the Convention, it caused enormous controversy and my friend and colleague Elmar Brok was one of the people who worked hardest to move in this direction. If you were to ask me which of the innovations in the European Constitution was the most significant, I would have no hesitation in saying the Foreign Affairs Minister. I believe that the figure of Foreign Affairs Minister, double-hatted, that is to say, appointed by the European Council but Vice-President of the European Commission, has prospered in the end because, for the intergovernmentalists, this is a way to get their hands on the Commission’s money and staff and, for the more Communitarianists, this is a way to have a say in the Union’s foreign policy. The way we structure this Minister's fundamental instrument, the Foreign Service, is therefore very important. And, Madam Vice-President, you have been extremely reserved. What do I mean by that? That you have told us nothing. In the document prepared by your services, you have told us that you are negotiating and that we will wait to see what happens. Well I would like to tell you that for my group, the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, this is a very important issue and that, given that foreign policy is something for governments rather than for peoples, for princes rather than peoples, as the old saying goes, we in this Parliament want control over the Union’s foreign policy. The location of the Foreign Service is therefore a crucial issue. We will therefore examine the location for this Service very closely and my Group friends and colleagues will undoubtedly be able to tell you very clearly in their speeches where we want it to be located.

Mr President, when at the last plenary session of the last term in office I had the honour of speaking on behalf of my group at an event held by this House in homage to Monnet, Schuman and Spinelli, I wondered what the founding fathers, the visionaries of Europe, would have thought of the point in European integration we were at and what they would have thought of the European Constitution. I believe – I said it then and I repeat it today – that they would not have believed that what was happening was real, because, leaving behind a Europe divided by fratricidal confrontations, this Constitution sanctions peace on our continent and, to use Mr Geremek’s beautiful expression, this Constitution stitches the two Europes together. We are moving on from a Europe desolated by totalitarian regimes to a Europe – and this is sanctioned by the Constitution – based on democratic systems in which fundamental rights are respected. After a Europe of ration books, this Constitution sanctions a Europe of prosperity and material well-being. Overcoming a Europe which had disappeared from the world, this Constitution sanctions a Europe of solidarity, as demonstrated by the enormous wave of solidarity which has arisen on our continent to deal with the effects of the other terrible wave that struck Asia. This Constitution will have, and does have, instruments which will allow Europe to play a greater role in the world from now on. I believe that the Constitution marks a point of no return and, just as, not so long ago, the Constitution of my country was the Constitution of harmony, which allowed us to move into the future, this European Constitution is going to allow all of us Europeans to move forward together within a project of common civilisation. The value of the European Constitution is that it removes the ambiguities; it is the first document to define what the European Union is, as a Union of States and citizens, and does not weaken the Member States, far from it, because the Union’s competences are competences that come from the Member States, and it does not weaken national Constitutions, quite the contrary: it strengthens them, because the strength of the European Constitution stems from the strength of the national Constitutions. With this Constitution, Europe is demonstrating that it is much more than a market; it is a market as well, and that is important, but it is much more: it is a project of common civilisation based on our religious, cultural and humanist heritage. This is acknowledged in the first sentence of the preamble, based on the values of freedom and human dignity, founded upon the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is also a Constitution that opts for a particular economic system: a capitalist system with a social dimension. If we look at the history of Europe, we see that that was not so obvious fifty years ago. Today it is. For all of these reasons, I believe, Mr President, that many of the flags that this Parliament has unfurled over recent years are today standing as proud as those we have behind us. I joined this Parliament 13 years ago, when it was a consultative assembly; today it no longer is. I joined this Parliament when there was talk of the European Union’s democratic deficit; I believe that the European Constitution will put an end to that democratic deficit, because this Constitution introduces more democracy, more efficiency, more clarity and more transparency, as my friend, Richard Corbett, has quite rightly pointed out. Mr President, this work has been done by many people over many years. I would like to acknowledge them today. I would like to remind you of the names of Emilio Colombo, Marcelino Oreja, Fernand Herman, Giorgio Napolitano, Olivier Duhamel, Antonio Seguro, Dimitris Tsatsos, Antoinette Spaak, and so many people who, seated here in this Parliament, have defended what today is going to become a reality. They have often been called utopians or dreamers; well, today, these dreams, these utopias, are becoming reality. We in this Parliament can feel very proud of the work we have done. Mr President, eight years ago in this very Chamber, a young Member of Parliament defended the opinion on the Treaty of Amsterdam and said that it was not perfect, as we knew, but that it was not the final destination, and cited, as I am going to do again today, a Miguel de Cervantes disenchanted with life in his final days, who said that there were occasions when we had to choose whether to be a road or an inn. That was a road, and that road has led us to where we are today and I believe that today, in this comfortable inn represented by the European Constitution, over the coming years we Europeans are going to find it to be an effective instrument to move Europe forward in peace, freedom, justice and solidarity. I would, therefore, be delighted if tomorrow this Parliament votes in favour of this document, and this is very important, since it ushers in a new era on our continent. (Applause)

Mr President, I am pleased to see you chairing this plenary sitting because it has a very important significance: that the President of the European Parliament stands by his word and that the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty is this Parliament’s political priority. I also believe, therefore, that this oral question from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs comes at a good time and – Jo Leinen said this very appropriately – it appeared that we had finished our work by approving the Constitutional Treaty. It appeared that the issue of ratification was now something which fell to the national authorities, to the Parliaments, to the peoples. I do not believe this, I believe that it falls to all of us and also to the institutions of the Union. I was very pleased, Mr Nicolaï, to hear you say that the Ministers are going to deal with this issue. You have signed the Constitutional Treaty and, therefore, you, like us, have an interest in seeing it ratified as soon as possible. Nevertheless, Commissioner Barrot’s speech worried me because, apart from the leaflets and the video, I heard that the Commission believes it would be harmful to carry out an information campaign at European level. How can it be harmful? What is the Commission’s view of the Constitutional Treaty? If it believes it represents progress, a step forward for the European citizens, it should say so, as Parliament will do. We are currently producing a report which will be approved on 15 December. If that report is in favour of the Constitutional Treaty, this Parliament must not remain neutral, but must campaign in favour of it. I therefore believe, Mr Barrot, that the Commission must consider what it is going to do on this issue. I believe it is very important to send a clear political signal of where we are, because the European Constitution is very important for the future of Europe and, therefore, all of us – the institutions of the Union and the Member States – must stand together in order to win this battle as well.

Mr President, on a point or order and so that it may appear in the Minutes, I would like to congratulate the interpreters on the translation into Spanish of Mr Joan i Marí’s speech, which was perfect.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must start by contradicting the previous speaker. The Irish Presidency has been a great political Presidency, rather than a technical one; and it has been so in difficult conditions, and at the time of the massacre of 11 March in Madrid. The first measures you have taken, such as the appointment of the anti-terrorist Coordinator, are steps in the right direction in terms of combating the scourge of terrorism, which affects our public freedoms. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have succeeded in reaching an agreement on the European Constitution. This Parliament is going to give its opinion on that text over the coming weeks and therefore – everybody knows my position on this issue – I do not wish to talk about it in advance, but I congratulate you because it was not easy to reach an agreement and, in the end, that agreement and the Constitution Europe needs are currently on the table. I would also like to congratulate you, Mr President, on the proposal to name Mr Durão Barroso as candidate for the Presidency of the Commission, because that agreement was not easy either. We have a great candidate and, above all, I believe we must make a political effort to put the Commission where it should be: at the centre of the Community method and of the life of the European Union. I hope that this important vote in favour of the candidate proposed to us by the European Council also moves in the direction of restoring relations between the Commission and the European Parliament, which are so important. Taoiseach
, I believe, however, that the most important issue during your Presidency has been enlargement. When, a few weeks ago, we celebrated the anniversary of Monnet and Spinelli, my group had the honour of representing you in this debate. I thought that if Monnet and Spinelli had been here, sitting on these benches, they would have thought that the enlargement achieved under the Irish Presidency, ‘the stitching together of the two Europes’, to use the expression of Mr Geremek, was the most important thing we have done over recent years, and that will always be to your credit. Much has been said here about large countries and small countries; I believe it is a pernicious distinction, which has never existed in European history. Why is a country large or small? Because of its population, the size of its territory, its GDP? No, a country is large or small depending on whether its leaders, its peoples and its citizens have ambition and vision. You, Taoiseach
, and Ireland, have been large in Europe during this Presidency.
